Wasson's Mushrooms, Russia and History (1957)","body":"# E-book: Mushrooms, Russia and History by V. P. Wasson & R. G. Wasson\r\n\r\nThis repository contains a work in progress e-book edition of Valentina Pavlovna Wasson and R. Gordon Wasson's pioneering two volume work *Mushrooms, Russia and History*. As only 512 copies were ever published, it is my hope that this e-book edition will make this fascinating work more accessible to the general public. \r\n\r\n![porcini](src/OEBPS/Images/index-14_1.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Notes on the E-book edition\r\n\r\nThis e-book edition was compiled and typeset by Bayard Randel <kit@nocturne.net.nz> . It was derived from the [New Alexandria Archive](http://www.newalexandria.org/archive/) digital edition pdf, which was scanned from the original copy no. 37, and hand corrected by Igor Dolgov, Zachary Jones, and Greg Golden.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\nTo build run:\r\n\r\n    make epub\r\n\r\nOnly epub is currently available.\r\n\r\n## Current Progress\r\n\r\n### Completed\r\n\r\n* Chapter layout\r\n* Frontmatter\r\n* Preface\r\n* Chapter I\r\n\r\n### Todo\r\n\r\n* Add support for building mobi\r\n\r\n## Changes from the original text\r\n\r\nIn order to adapt this work to e-book formats, a number of changes have been made:\r\n\r\n* While Mushrooms, Russia and History was originally published in two volumes, both volumes are presented here as a single e-book for convenience. References to volumes in the text have been removed.\r\n* As e-book page layouts are fluid and device dependant, the position of figures and plates have been changed to improve clarity.\r\n* Footnotes are rendered at the end of chapters and numbered per chapter rather than per page.\r\n* References to page numbers from the original text have been removed. Links instead are provided from appendicies and indicies.\r\n\r\n## Changes from the New Alexandria Archive digital edition pdf\r\n\r\nWhere possible I have endeavoured to edit and correct errors in the text which presumably resulted from errors in OCR. Unfortunately I do not possess, nor know of an original copy of *Mushrooms, Russia and History* available for reference in New Zealand to ensure the absolute parity of this edition with the original text.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with corrections. Pull requests are also welcome.\r\n","google":"UA-41290112-3","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
