Wasson & R. G. Wasson\r\n\r\nThis repository contains a work in progress e-book edition of Valentina Pavlovna Wasson and R. Gordon Wasson's pioneering two volume work *Mushrooms, Russia and History*. As only 512 copies were ever published, it is my hope that this e-book edition will make this fascinating work more accessible to the general public. \r\n\r\n![porcini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squidsoup/mushrooms-russia-history-ebook/master/src/OEBPS/Images/index-14_1.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Notes on the eBook edition\r\n\r\nThis eBook edition was compiled and typeset by Bayard Randel <kit@nocturne.net.nz> . It was derived from the [New Alexandria Archive](http://www.newalexandria.org/archive/) digital edition pdf, which was scanned from the original copy no. 37, and hand corrected by Igor Dolgov, Zachary Jones, and Greg Golden.\r\n\r\n## Make tasks\r\n### Build\r\nTo build eBooks run:\r\n\r\n    make\r\n\r\n#### Epub only\r\n\r\n    make epub\r\n\r\n#### Mobi only\r\n\r\n    make mobi\r\n\r\n*Note*: Building mobi/all requires [Kindlegen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211) on your path.\r\n\r\n### Verify\r\nTo verify the epub, run:\r\n\r\n    make check\r\n\r\n*Note*: This requires [epubcheck](https://github.com/idpf/epubcheck) on your path.\r\n\r\n## Current Progress\r\n\r\n### Completed\r\n\r\n* Frontmatter\r\n* Preface\r\n* Biblio\r\n* All Chapters\r\n\r\n### Todo\r\n\r\n* Proof-reading (particularly noting text requiring correction from the original, enumerated in [errors.md](errors.md)\r\n* Indicies\r\n  * Index of Mushroom Names is full of errors, which require reference to the original for corrections.\r\n  * Indicies require links to anchors within the text.\r\n  \r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with corrections. If you have access to the original texts, please see a list of errors that I need assistance with in [errors.md](errors.md). If you are in possession of an original edition of *Mushrooms, Russia and History*, I would be very grateful to hear from you and any assistance you could provide to ensure this e-book edition is as accurate as possible.\r\n\r\n## Changes from the original text\r\n\r\nIn order to adapt this work to e-book formats, a number of changes have been made:\r\n\r\n* While Mushrooms, Russia and History was originally published in two volumes, both volumes are presented here as a single e-book for convenience. References to volumes in the text have been removed.\r\n* As e-book page layouts are fluid and device dependant, the position of figures and plates have been changed to improve clarity.\r\n* Footnotes are rendered at the end of chapters and numbered per chapter rather than per page.\r\n* References to page numbers from the original text have been removed. Links instead are provided from appendicies and indicies.\r\n\r\n## Changes from the New Alexandria Archive digital edition pdf\r\n\r\nWhere possible I have endeavoured to edit and correct errors in the text which presumably resulted from errors in OCR. Unfortunately I do not possess, nor know of an original copy of *Mushrooms, Russia and History* available for reference in New Zealand to ensure the absolute parity of this edition with the original text.\r\n","google":"UA-41290112-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
