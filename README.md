# Mushroom, Russia and History

This e-book edition was compiled and typeset by Bayard Randel <kit@nocturne.net.nz> . It was derived from the New Alexandria Archive digital edition pdf, which was scanned from the original copy no. 37, and hand corrected by Igor Dolgov, Zachary Jones, and Greg Golden.

* Preface

## Changes from the original text

In order to adapt this work to e-book formats, a number of changes have been made:

* While Mushrooms, Russia and History was originally published in two volumes, both volumes are presented here as a single e-book for convenience. References to volumes in the text have been removed.
* As e-book page layouts are fluid and device dependant, the position of figures and plates have been changed to improve clarity.
* Footnotes are rendered at the end of chapters and numbered per chapter rather than per page.
* References to page numbers from the original text have been removed. Links instead are provided from appendicies and indicies.

## Changes from the New Alexandria Archive digital edition pdf

Where possible I have endeavoured to edit and correct errors in the text which presumably resulted from errors in OCR. Unfortunately I do not possess, nor know of an original copy of Mushrooms, Russia and History available for reference in New Zealand to ensure the absolute parity of this edition with the original text. Please feel free to contact me with corrections.
