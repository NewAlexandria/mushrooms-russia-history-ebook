# E-book: Mushrooms, Russia and History by V. P. Wasson & R. G. Wasson

This repository contains a work in progress e-book edition of Valentina Pavlovna Wasson and R. Gordon Wasson's pioneering two volume work *Mushrooms, Russia and History*. As only 512 copies were ever published, it is my hope that this e-book edition will make this fascinating work more accessible to the general public. 

## Notes on the E-book edition

This e-book edition was compiled and typeset by Bayard Randel <kit@nocturne.net.nz> . It was derived from the [New Alexandria Archive](http://www.newalexandria.org/archive/) digital edition pdf, which was scanned from the original copy no. 37, and hand corrected by Igor Dolgov, Zachary Jones, and Greg Golden.

## Current Progress

### Completed

* Chapter layout
* Frontmatter
* Preface

## Changes from the original text

In order to adapt this work to e-book formats, a number of changes have been made:

* While Mushrooms, Russia and History was originally published in two volumes, both volumes are presented here as a single e-book for convenience. References to volumes in the text have been removed.
* As e-book page layouts are fluid and device dependant, the position of figures and plates have been changed to improve clarity.
* Footnotes are rendered at the end of chapters and numbered per chapter rather than per page.
* References to page numbers from the original text have been removed. Links instead are provided from appendicies and indicies.

## Changes from the New Alexandria Archive digital edition pdf

Where possible I have endeavoured to edit and correct errors in the text which presumably resulted from errors in OCR. Unfortunately I do not possess, nor know of an original copy of *Mushrooms, Russia and History* available for reference in New Zealand to ensure the absolute parity of this edition with the original text.
