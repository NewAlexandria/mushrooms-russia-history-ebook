        <h2>17<br/>'GAMA NO KOSHIKAKE' AND 'HEGBA MBODDO'</h2>

        <section class="main">
            <p class="calibre1">Our inquiries into the toadstool world are mostly confined to Europe and the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Indo-European fungal vocabulary, including the diffusion of the European words</p>

            <p class="calibre1">across Siberia. We have brought in the Eskimos, the Maoris, and the Tanala</p>

            <p class="calibre1">people of Madagascar; and we have traveled in Middle America. But the extent</p>

            <p class="calibre1">to which toads and fungi are associated with each other in the minds of other</p>

            <p class="calibre1">branches of the human family remains unanswered, and offers endless perspec-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">tives for research. We leave most of those inviting prospects for others to explore.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">(If this announcement inspires in the reader heartfelt Hosannas, let him imagine</p>

            <p class="calibre1">how much greater is our relief!) For those who take up the pursuit, we here</p>

            <p class="calibre1">submit two tantalizing items of information, plus a note on Chinese mycophagy.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">1 he Japanese people are mighty mycophiles, possessing a large mushroom</p>

            <p class="calibre1">vocabulary and an especially warm affection for several edible species. In the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">hierarchy of esteem, they place first the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">matsutake,</i>&nbsp;a gilled species that grows in</p>

            <p class="calibre1">red-pine woods, related to the genus armillariella, and famous for its inviting aro-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">ma. The&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">matsutake</i>&nbsp;of the Kyoto woods are the most highly prized, and in the fall</p>

            <p class="calibre1">of the year picnics are organized to hunt them. Old records speak of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">matsutake</i></p>

            <p class="calibre1">as far back as the I3th century; before then a species known as the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">hiratake</i>&nbsp;ap-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">pears to have occupied the premier position among the Japanese. The&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">shiitake</i></p>

            <p class="calibre1">is a related species that grows on the trunks of certain trees, and that is cultivated</p>

            <p class="calibre1">in large quantities on trunks cut down for that purpose. Both the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">matsutake</i>&nbsp;and</p>

            <p class="calibre1">the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">shiitake</i>&nbsp;are species peculiar to Japan and perhaps Korea. The collybia velu-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">tipes, gathered young and small, is a favorite in soup; it bears many names, of</p>

            <p class="calibre1">which&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">nameko</i>&nbsp;is the commonest. An important role is also played by the rhizo-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">pogon rubescens, known as the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">shoro.</i>&nbsp;But the species that is of immediate interest</p>

            <p class="calibre1">for our purpose is the inedible shelf-mushroom known normally in Japanese as</p>

            <p class="calibre1">the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">saru no koshikake,</i>&nbsp;the 'monkey's stool'. We have discovered that in certain</p>

            <p class="calibre1">villages of Chiba prefecture, across the bay from Tokyo, the peasants call this</p>

            <p class="calibre1">fungus&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">the gama no koshikake,</i>&nbsp;or toad's stool; notably in three northern&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">gun</i>&nbsp;or</p>

            <p class="calibre1">townships of the prefecture, by name Imba, Katori, and Sousa.&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Gama</i>&nbsp;is the name</p>

            <p class="calibre1">for 'toad' in the Kanto dialect of Japanese, spoken in Tokyo and thereabouts.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">On pushing our inquiries, we discovered that&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">gama no koshikake</i>&nbsp;was an alter-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">native expression for&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">kama no koshikake,</i>&nbsp;which would mean the stool of the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">household furnace god&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">o-kama-sama,</i>&nbsp;and the longer expression and more old-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">fashioned would be&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">o-kama-sama no koshikake.</i>&nbsp;Toads are associated in the pea-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">330</p>

            <p class="calibre1">'GAMA NO KOSHIKAKE' AND 'HEGBA MBODDO'</p>

            <p class="calibre1">sants' minds with the big stove that occupies an unfloored part of their houses,</p>

            <p class="calibre1">and there may be a genetic relationship, or at least a semantic association, between</p>

            <p class="calibre1">the word for toad in the Kanto dialect and the names of the furnace god. The</p>

            <p class="calibre1">peasants regard the toad with no repugnance; its presence is even considered</p>

            <p class="calibre1">auspicious in some regions.1</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Thus in Japan we have irrefutable evidence of an association between toads</p>

            <p class="calibre1">and fungi of indigenous inspiration, and for us the astonishing feature is that</p>

            <p class="calibre1">this association is tied to fire and a fire divinity.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">.r rofessor Roger Heim described in his&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Revue de Mycologie</i>&nbsp;in February 1936</p>

            <p class="calibre1">three giant boleti of Madagascar and tropical Africa. One of these bears the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">scientific name of boletus (Xerocomus) sudanicus Har. et Pat., and is native to</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Central Africa. In the course of Professor Heim's article there appears a foot-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">note wherein the reader is told that in the region known as the Chari the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">native name for this edible and highly esteemed boletus is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">hegba</b>&nbsp;mboddo,</i>&nbsp;and</p>

            <p class="calibre1">that this means literally 'toad's stool'. The Chari is an important river running</p>

            <p class="calibre1">north and west through French Equatorial Africa, emptying into Lake Chad.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">For our inquiries Professor Heim's report was of the highest interest. Was it</p>

            <p class="calibre1">conceivable that a people in the heart of Africa used the same fungal metaphor</p>

            <p class="calibre1">as the peoples in the North Sea basin ? In the cultural crazy quilt of darkest</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Africa could we discover the race for whom&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">hegba mboddo</i>&nbsp;was a fungal designa-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">tion? Our explorations (by correspondence) covered the Sara and certain other</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Sudanese languages, and also five of the languages of the Sudan central tribes :</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Kara, Banu, Gbe, Kaba, and Sango. In every case the results were negative, as</p>

            <p class="calibre1">they were at first among the Bantu peoples. At this point we consulted Professor</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Archie N. Tucker, of the School of Oriental and African Studies at the Uni-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">versity of London, and he knew the answer at once:&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">hegba mboddo</i>&nbsp;is a term</p>

            <p class="calibre1">used by the little known people of Bongoland, described by the German ex-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">plorer Georg Schweinfurth following his visit to the Bongo country in the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">i86o's. His book appeared in English in 1874 as&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">The Heart of Africa,</i>&nbsp;and he is</p>

            <p class="calibre1">the authority for the use of the term that interests us. In Schweinfurth's time</p>

            <p class="calibre1">no white men had previously visited the Bongo people and observed them,</p>

            <p class="calibre1">and there can be no possibility of European influence. The Bongo live in the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">very heart of Africa, in two enclaves, north of the 7° parallel North and to the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">westward of the 29° East longitude. They are a farming folk. Here is what</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Schweinfurth had to say about the mycophilia of the Bongo people:</p>

            <p class="calibre1">I. We are indebted for our information to Professor Kunio Yanagita, the eminent Japanese authority on folk-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">lore and dialects, to Mrs. Chiyo Omachi who assembled and interpreted in English the evidence, and to Pro-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">fessor Toyohiko Kawabata of Chiba University for verifying the usage in the various&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">gun</i>&nbsp;of his prefecture.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">During the rainy season the country is prolific in many kinds of funguses. The Bongo</p>

            <p class="calibre1">have a great fancy for them; they keep them until they are on the verge of decay, and</p>

            <p class="calibre1">then dry and pound them. They use them for the purpose of flavouring their sauces,</p>

            <p class="calibre1">which in consequence are enriched by a <i class="calibre4">hautgout,</i> which without depreciation may perhaps</p>

            <p class="calibre1">be compared to rotten fish. Throughout the country I never saw any funguses but what</p>

            <p class="calibre1">were perfectly edible, and some of them I must confess [sic] were perfectly palatable. The</p>

            <p class="calibre1">natives call them all 'kahoo', while to the larger species they give the special name of</p>

            <p class="calibre1">'hegba-mboddoh', which is synonymous with the Low German 'poggen staul', or with</p>

            <p class="calibre1">the English 'toadstool'. 'Hegba' is the name which the Bongo give to their little carved</p>

            <p class="calibre1">stools, and 'mboddoh' is the generic term for all frogs and toads, and the proper name</p>

            <p class="calibre1">for the <i class="calibre4">bufo pandarinus</i> in particular. This 'hegba mboddoh' which has thus suggested the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">same idea in very remote parts of the world, is here a gigantic polyporus; not infre-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">quently specimens may be found of it which grow to a height of nine inches, and a foot</p>

            <p class="calibre1">in diameter and weigh nearly fifty pounds. In form, size, and color they are not unlike</p>

            <p class="calibre1">the grey clay edifices of the Termes mordax . . . The funguses which are the most com-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">mon, and which are moreover the most preferred, are the different species of coprinus,</p>

            <p class="calibre1">marasmius, rhodoporus, and the tough but aromatic lentinus.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">The Bongo have been neglected by anthropologists: Schweinfurth is still the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">principal authority on them. His testimony about the <i class="calibre4">hegba tnboddo</i> is certainly</p>

            <p class="calibre1">trustworthy, but it should be verified and amplified. The giant fungus is eaten</p>

            <p class="calibre1">by the Bongo: for them the association with the toad is not an epithet of</p>

            <p class="calibre1">mycophobic rejection. Who will discover for us the full meaning of the toad in</p>

            <p class="calibre1">the culture of the natives of Bongoland? Must we go there ourselves to arrive</p>

            <p class="calibre1">at the answer? The language of the Bongo is one of a large group including</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Sara (of which Kaba is a member), Kenga, and Bagirmi.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">The discovery of the 'toadstool' in Bongoland is sensational for us with our</p>

            <p class="calibre1">peculiar interest, but this is not the end. Professor Tucker happened to lay</p>

            <p class="calibre1">our question before Mr. Jalo Gombe, an African in London at the time our</p>

            <p class="calibre1">letter reached him. He belongs to the Fulani people, in Nigeria, far to the west</p>

            <p class="calibre1">of the Bongo and separated from them by many African peoples. He is a teacher</p>

            <p class="calibre1">in the senior high school at Gombe, a community that one reaches by way of</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Jos. 'Fulani' is the name of this people in the Hausa language. The French call</p>

            <p class="calibre1">them 'Peul'; in their own language one Fulani is 'Pullo', more than one 'Fulbe',</p>

            <p class="calibre1">and they call their tongue 'Fulfulde'. It is essential to set forth these various</p>

            <p class="calibre1">words, as they are all in current use and can cause confusion. Mr. Gombe in a</p>

            <p class="calibre1">long and informative letter apprises us that in his native language the general</p>

            <p class="calibre1">word for all wild mushrooms is <i class="calibre4">kow.wal pa:bi.</i> (The colon indicates a long</p>

            <p class="calibre1">vowel; the <i class="calibre4">b</i> in this word, like the <i class="calibre4">dd</i> in <i class="calibre4">hegba tnboddo,</i> is what linguists call</p>

            <p class="calibre1">'implosive' or 'ingressive'.) <i class="calibre4">Koro:wal</i> means 'stool' and <i class="calibre4">pa:bi</i> is the word for</p>

            <p class="calibre1">frogs and toads. Mr. Gombe further informs us that wild mushrooms are not</p>

            <p class="calibre1">332</p>

            <p class="calibre1">'GAMA NO KOSHIKAKE' AND 'HEGBA MBODDO'</p>

            <p class="calibre1">eaten by the Fulani, nor do they eat frogs or toads though certain neighboring</p>

            <p class="calibre1">tribes do so. The Fulani consider toads unclean and some, especially among the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">women, fear them. Toads are used in folk medicine. There is a disease of the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">forehead called in Hausa 'monkey's forehead' <i class="calibre4">(goshin</i> Inn); to treat it the Fulani</p>

            <p class="calibre1">rub the forehead with the belly of a living toad, and it is said that the patient</p>

            <p class="calibre1">then recovers and the toad, thrown away, dies. The skin of the toad is used as a</p>

            <p class="calibre1">charm and when "placed somehow may cause someone impotency". A certain</p>

            <p class="calibre1">toadstool mixed with a certain tree fungus and soaked in water is used in treat-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">ing venereal disorders.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Our African inquiries led us to a third discovery. In Uganda the principal</p>

            <p class="calibre1">province is Buganda (of which 'Uganda' appears to be a corruption), and the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">principal native clan in that province is known as the Baganda, whose language,</p>

            <p class="calibre1">called Luganda, belongs to the immense Bantu family. All of the clans of</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Buganda are valiantly mycophagous, according to our gifted native informant,</p>

            <p class="calibre1">M. B. Nsimbi, of Kampala. The Baganda are known as the 'mushroom clan',</p>

            <p class="calibre1">for they have as their totem two kinds of mushrooms, known in Luganda as the</p>

            <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">bubaala</i> and the <i class="calibre4">namulondo.</i> By the native gastronomes of Buganda the <i class="calibre4">bubaala</i></p>

            <p class="calibre1">are the most highly prized of all mushrooms, but the Baganda must deny</p>

            <p class="calibre1">themselves these delights, for they may not eat their own totems. For us the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">interesting feature of the fungal vocabulary of the Baganda is the presence of the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">toad. There is a mushroom known in Luganda as the <i class="calibre4">ngngoma-ya-kikere,</i> which</p>

            <p class="calibre1">means 'drum-of-toad', and which no one eats. In shape it suggests the native</p>

            <p class="calibre1">drum, which in Africa is traditionally a symbol of authority, analogous to the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">parasol in India.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">In conclusion, then, we discover in the interior of Africa two peoples, both</p>

            <p class="calibre1">of them remote from each other geographically, linguistically, and culturally,</p>

            <p class="calibre1">who possess indigenous terms for mushrooms that are semantically identical</p>

            <p class="calibre1">to the 'toadstool' of the North Sea basin. One of these peoples, the Bongo, ap-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">pear to be mycophiles, and the other, the Fulani, are mycophobes. In addition, we</p>

            <p class="calibre1">discover a third people, who associate a drum-shaped mushroom with the toad.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Among Africans both the drum and the stool sometimes symbolize authority.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Up to this point in our book we have only touched on China and the cult</p>

            <p class="calibre1">of the mushroom in the Chinese cuisine. The subject is vast and the sources of</p>

            <p class="calibre1">information are inaccessible. We shall do no more than offer two samples of</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Chinese lore that have happened to come to our attention.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">There is the problem of <i class="calibre4">mo-gu.</i> This is the colloquial name in northern China</p>

            <p class="calibre1">of the clavaria pistillaris, one of the mushrooms most highly esteemed by</p>

            <p class="calibre1">333</p>

            <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-153_1.jpg" /></p>

            <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-153_3.jpg" /></p>

            <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

            <p class="calibre1">Chinese epicures. In the Mongolian language we discover a general word for</p>

            <p class="calibre1">mushrooms,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">rndgti,</i>&nbsp;and the Chinese word may have been imported with the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">clavaria pistillaris from Mongolia. Is it possible that the Mongolian word was a</p>

            <p class="calibre1">borrowing from Indo-European, being in short another member of our sponge</p>

            <p class="calibre1">cluster of fungal words descended from the same root as σπόγγος? The phonetic</p>

            <p class="calibre1">evolution in Mongolian is not impossible. An initial 'p', passing through 'b',</p>

            <p class="calibre1">would become 'm'. The alternation between 'b' and 'm' in Mongolian is well</p>

            <p class="calibre1">attested, e.g.,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">becin</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">mecin,</i>&nbsp;meaning monkey. There is also precedent in</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Mongolian for dropping an internal nasal in borrowed words.</p>

            <p class="calibre1">In the fungal hierarchy of the Chinese cuisine the highest rating belongs to</p>

            <p class="calibre1">the Monkey Head Mushroom, concerning which Mr. K. C. Wu, the former</p>

            <p class="calibre1">governor of Formosa, has given us curious information. This is a rare mushroom,</p>

            <p class="calibre1">sells at a high price, and never passes through the vulgar marketplaces. Its</p>

            <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">parfum</i>&nbsp;is of exquisite delicacy, and it transforms any dish that it flavors. So</p>

            <p class="calibre1">precious is it that only the best cooks are entrusted with it. The Monkey Head</p>

            <p class="calibre1">Mushroom is represented in Chinese characters thus:</p>

            <p class="calibre1"></p>

            <p class="calibre1">It is found only in the high mountains of Central China, and the best come from</p>

            <p class="calibre1">the sacred range of Sung Mountains :</p>

            <p class="calibre1">sung shan</p>

            <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">sung mountain</i></p>

            <p class="calibre1">They grow out of the trunks of trees, and are of the size of small monkey</p>

            <p class="calibre1">heads, with yellow hair, two dots for eyes, and curves that are singularly sug-</p>

            <p class="calibre1">gestive of a nose and mouth. We are told that where one grows another is</p>

            <p class="calibre1">always to be found, and they are considered mates, male and female. When</p>

            <p class="calibre1">you find one, you follow the direction of its eyes, and there on another</p>

            <p class="calibre1">tree is the other one. They gaze on each other in a perpetual trance. Who is the</p>

            <p class="calibre1">mycologist that will identify for us the Monkey Head Mushroom?</p>
