        <h2>17<br/>&rsquo;GAMA NO KOSHIKAKE&rsquo; AND &lsquo;HEGBA MBODDO&rsquo;</h2>

        <section class="main">
            <p><span class="initial">O</span>ur inquiries into the toadstool world are mostly confined to Europe and the Indo-European fungal vocabulary, including the diffusion of the European words across Siberia. We have brought in the Eskimos, the Maoris, and the Tanala people of Madagascar; and we have traveled in Middle America. But the extent to which toads and fungi are associated with each other in the minds of other branches of the human family remains unanswered, and offers endless perspec- tives for research. We leave most of those inviting prospects for others to explore. (If this announcement inspires in the reader heartfelt Hosannas, let him imagine how much greater is our relief!) For those who take up the pursuit, we here submit two tantalizing items of information, plus a note on Chinese mycophagy.</p>

           <p>The Japanese people are mighty mycophiles, possessing a large mushroom vocabulary and an especially warm affection for several edible species. In the hierarchy of esteem, they place first the&nbsp;<i>matsutake,</i>&nbsp;a gilled species that grows in red-pine woods, related to the genus armillariella, and famous for its inviting aroma. The&nbsp;<i>matsutake</i>&nbsp;of the Kyoto woods are the most highly prized, and in the fall of the year picnics are organized to hunt them. Old records speak of&nbsp;<i>matsutake</i> as far back as the 13<sup>th</sup> century; before then a species known as the&nbsp;<i>hiratake</i>&nbsp;ap- pears to have occupied the premier position among the Japanese. The&nbsp;<i>shiitake</i> is a related species that grows on the trunks of certain trees, and that is cultivated in large quantities on trunks cut down for that purpose. Both the&nbsp;<i>matsutake</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>shiitake</i>&nbsp;are species peculiar to Japan and perhaps Korea. The collybia velu- tipes, gathered young and small, is a favorite in soup; it bears many names, of which&nbsp;<i>nameko</i>&nbsp;is the commonest. An important role is also played by the rhizo- pogon rubescens, known as the&nbsp;<i>shoro.</i>&nbsp;But the species that is of immediate interest for our purpose is the inedible shelf-mushroom known normally in Japanese as the&nbsp;<i>saru no koshikake,</i>&nbsp;the &lsquo;monkey&rsquo;s stool&rsquo;. We have discovered that in certain villages of Chiba prefecture, across the bay from Tokyo, the peasants call this fungus&nbsp;<i>the gama no koshikake,</i>&nbsp;or toad&rsquo;s stool; notably in three northern&nbsp;<i>gun</i>&nbsp;or townships of the prefecture, by name Imba, Katori, and Sousa.&nbsp;<i>Gama</i>&nbsp;is the name for &lsquo;toad&rsquo; in the Kanto dialect of Japanese, spoken in Tokyo and thereabouts. On pushing our inquiries, we discovered that&nbsp;<i>gama no koshikake</i>&nbsp;was an alternative expression for&nbsp;<i>kama no koshikake,</i>&nbsp;which would mean the stool of the household furnace god&nbsp;<i>o-kama-sama,</i>&nbsp;and the longer expression and more old-fashioned would be&nbsp;<i>o-kama-sama no koshikake.</i>&nbsp;Toads are associated in the peasants&rsquo; minds with the big stove that occupies an unfloored part of their houses, and there may be a genetic relationship, or at least a semantic association, between the word for toad in the Kanto dialect and the names of the furnace god. The peasants regard the toad with no repugnance; its presence is even considered auspicious in some regions.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b17-fn1" id="cp5b17-r1">[1]</a></sup></p>

           <p>Thus in Japan we have irrefutable evidence of an association between toads and fungi of indigenous inspiration, and for us the astonishing feature is that this association is tied to fire and a fire divinity.</p>

           <p>Professor Roger Heim described in his&nbsp;<i>Revue de Mycologie</i>&nbsp;in February 1936 three giant boleti of Madagascar and tropical Africa. One of these bears the scientific name of boletus (Xerocomus) sudanicus Har. et Pat., and is native to Central Africa. In the course of Professor Heim&rsquo;s article there appears a footnote wherein the reader is told that in the region known as the Chari the native name for this edible and highly esteemed boletus is&nbsp;<i>hegba&nbsp;mboddo,</i>&nbsp;and that this means literally &lsquo;toad&rsquo;s stool&rsquo;. The Chari is an important river running north and west through French Equatorial Africa, emptying into Lake Chad. For our inquiries Professor Heim&rsquo;s report was of the highest interest. Was it conceivable that a people in the heart of Africa used the same fungal metaphor as the peoples in the North Sea basin ? In the cultural crazy quilt of darkest Africa could we discover the race for whom&nbsp;<i>hegba mboddo</i>&nbsp;was a fungal designation? Our explorations (by correspondence) covered the Sara and certain other Sudanese languages, and also five of the languages of the Sudan central tribes: Kara, Banu, Gbe, Kaba, and Sango. In every case the results were negative, as they were at first among the Bantu peoples. At this point we consulted Professor Archie N. Tucker, of the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, and he knew the answer at once:&nbsp;<i>hegba mboddo</i>&nbsp;is a term used by the little known people of Bongoland, described by the German explorer Georg Schweinfurth following his visit to the Bongo country in the 1860&rsquo;s. His book appeared in English in 1874 as&nbsp;<i>The Heart of Africa,</i>&nbsp;and he is the authority for the use of the term that interests us. In Schweinfurth&rsquo;s time no white men had previously visited the Bongo people and observed them, and there can be no possibility of European influence. The Bongo live in the very heart of Africa, in two enclaves, north of the 7° parallel North and to the westward of the 29° East longitude. They are a farming folk. Here is what Schweinfurth had to say about the mycophilia of the Bongo people:</p>

           <blockquote>
               <p>During the rainy season the country is prolific in many kinds of funguses. The Bongo have a great fancy for them; they keep them until they are on the verge of decay, and then dry and pound them. They use them for the purpose of flavouring their sauces, which in consequence are enriched by a <i>hautgout,</i> which without depreciation may perhaps be compared to rotten fish. Throughout the country I never saw any funguses but what were perfectly edible, and some of them I must confess [sic] were perfectly palatable. The natives call them all &lsquo;kahoo&rsquo;, while to the larger species they give the special name of &lsquo;hegba-mboddoh&rsquo;, which is synonymous with the Low German &lsquo;poggen staul&rsquo;, or with the English &lsquo;toadstool&rsquo;. &lsquo;Hegba&rsquo; is the name which the Bongo give to their little carved stools, and &lsquo;mboddoh&rsquo; is the generic term for all frogs and toads, and the proper name for the <i>bufo pandarinus</i> in particular. This &lsquo;hegba mboddoh&rsquo; which has thus suggested the same idea in very remote parts of the world, is here a gigantic polyporus; not infrequently specimens may be found of it which grow to a height of nine inches, and a foot in diameter and weigh nearly fifty pounds. In form, size, and color they are not unlike the grey clay edifices of the Termes mordax &hellip; The funguses which are the most common, and which are moreover the most preferred, are the different species of coprinus, marasmius, rhodoporus, and the tough but aromatic lentinus.</p>
           </blockquote>

           <p>The Bongo have been neglected by anthropologists: Schweinfurth is still the principal authority on them. His testimony about the <i>hegba tnboddo</i> is certainly trustworthy, but it should be verified and amplified. The giant fungus is eaten by the Bongo: for them the association with the toad is not an epithet of mycophobic rejection. Who will discover for us the full meaning of the toad in the culture of the natives of Bongoland? Must we go there ourselves to arrive at the answer? The language of the Bongo is one of a large group including Sara (of which Kaba is a member), Kenga, and Bagirmi.</p>

           <p>The discovery of the &lsquo;toadstool&rsquo; in Bongoland is sensational for us with our peculiar interest, but this is not the end. Professor Tucker happened to lay our question before Mr. Jalo Gombe, an African in London at the time our letter reached him. He belongs to the Fulani people, in Nigeria, far to the west of the Bongo and separated from them by many African peoples. He is a teacher in the senior high school at Gombe, a community that one reaches by way of Jos. &lsquo;Fulani&rsquo; is the name of this people in the Hausa language. The French call them &lsquo;Peul&rsquo;; in their own language one Fulani is &lsquo;Pullo&rsquo;, more than one &lsquo;Fulbe&rsquo;, and they call their tongue &lsquo;Fulfulde&rsquo;. It is essential to set forth these various words, as they are all in current use and can cause confusion. Mr. Gombe in a long and informative letter apprises us that in his native language the general word for all wild mushrooms is <i>kow.wal pa:bi.</i> (The colon indicates a long vowel; the <i>b</i> in this word, like the <i>dd</i> in <i>hegba tnboddo,</i> is what linguists call &lsquo;implosive&rsquo; or &lsquo;ingressive&rsquo;.) <i>Koro:wal</i> means &lsquo;stool&rsquo; and <i>pa:bi</i> is the word for frogs and toads. Mr. Gombe further informs us that wild mushrooms are not eaten by the Fulani, nor do they eat frogs or toads though certain neighboring tribes do so. The Fulani consider toads unclean and some, especially among the women, fear them. Toads are used in folk medicine. There is a disease of the forehead called in Hausa &lsquo;monkey&rsquo;s forehead&rsquo; <i>(goshin</i> Inn); to treat it the Fulani rub the forehead with the belly of a living toad, and it is said that the patient then recovers and the toad, thrown away, dies. The skin of the toad is used as a charm and when &ldquo;placed somehow may cause someone impotency&rdquo;. A certain toadstool mixed with a certain tree fungus and soaked in water is used in treating venereal disorders.</p>

           <p>Our African inquiries led us to a third discovery. In Uganda the principal province is Buganda (of which &lsquo;Uganda&rsquo; appears to be a corruption), and the principal native clan in that province is known as the Baganda, whose language, called Luganda, belongs to the immense Bantu family. All of the clans of Buganda are valiantly mycophagous, according to our gifted native informant, M. B. Nsimbi, of Kampala. The Baganda are known as the &lsquo;mushroom clan&rsquo;, for they have as their totem two kinds of mushrooms, known in Luganda as the <i>bubaala</i> and the <i>namulondo.</i> By the native gastronomes of Buganda the <i>bubaala</i> are the most highly prized of all mushrooms, but the Baganda must deny themselves these delights, for they may not eat their own totems. For us the interesting feature of the fungal vocabulary of the Baganda is the presence of the toad. There is a mushroom known in Luganda as the <i>ngngoma-ya-kikere,</i> which means &lsquo;drum-of-toad&rsquo;, and which no one eats. In shape it suggests the native drum, which in Africa is traditionally a symbol of authority, analogous to the parasol in India.</p>

           <p>In conclusion, then, we discover in the interior of Africa two peoples, both of them remote from each other geographically, linguistically, and culturally, who possess indigenous terms for mushrooms that are semantically identical to the &lsquo;toadstool&rsquo; of the North Sea basin. One of these peoples, the Bongo, appear to be mycophiles, and the other, the Fulani, are mycophobes. In addition, we discover a third people, who associate a drum-shaped mushroom with the toad. Among Africans both the drum and the stool sometimes symbolize authority. Up to this point in our book we have only touched on China and the cult of the mushroom in the Chinese cuisine. The subject is vast and the sources of information are inaccessible. We shall do no more than offer two samples of Chinese lore that have happened to come to our attention.</p>

           <p>There is the problem of <i>mo-gu.</i> This is the colloquial name in northern China of the clavaria pistillaris, one of the mushrooms most highly esteemed by Chinese epicures. In the Mongolian language we discover a general word for mushrooms,&nbsp;<i>rndgti,</i>&nbsp;and the Chinese word may have been imported with the clavaria pistillaris from Mongolia. Is it possible that the Mongolian word was a borrowing from Indo-European, being in short another member of our sponge cluster of fungal words descended from the same root as σπόγγος? The phonetic evolution in Mongolian is not impossible. An initial &lsquo;p&rsquo;, passing through &lsquo;b&rsquo;, would become &lsquo;m&rsquo;. The alternation between &lsquo;b&rsquo; and &lsquo;m&rsquo; in Mongolian is well attested, e.g.,&nbsp;<i>becin</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>mecin,</i>&nbsp;meaning monkey. There is also precedent in Mongolian for dropping an internal nasal in borrowed words. In the fungal hierarchy of the Chinese cuisine the highest rating belongs to the Monkey Head Mushroom, concerning which Mr. K. C. Wu, the former governor of Formosa, has given us curious information. This is a rare mushroom, sells at a high price, and never passes through the vulgar marketplaces. Its <i>parfum</i>&nbsp;is of exquisite delicacy, and it transforms any dish that it flavors. So precious is it that only the best cooks are entrusted with it. The Monkey Head Mushroom is represented in Chinese characters thus:</p>

           </figure>

           <p>It is found only in the high mountains of Central China, and the best come from the sacred range of Sung Mountains:</p>

           </figure>

           <p>They grow out of the trunks of trees, and are of the size of small monkey heads, with yellow hair, two dots for eyes, and curves that are singularly suggestive of a nose and mouth. We are told that where one grows another is always to be found, and they are considered mates, male and female. When you find one, you follow the direction of its eyes, and there on another tree is the other one. They gaze on each other in a perpetual trance. Who is the mycologist that will identify for us the Monkey Head Mushroom?</p>
