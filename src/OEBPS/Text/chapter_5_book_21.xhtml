            <p><span class="initial">N</span>ow our excursion among the mushrooms has ended. Free of professional inhibitions, we as amateurs have traveled far and wide, brazenly suggesting novel etymologies and theories of our own. Some of these, when put to further test, are sure to crumble. But our argument is a frontal one, and does not depend on single links. Beginning with an addiction to wild mushrooms and keeping our eye always on them, we have compared the words used for fungi by the various Indo-European peoples, concentrating on the metaphors that are latent in them. We have found a series of semantic themes recurring throughout these fungal vocabularies, and these themes have suggested origins for many words that have heretofore baffled the philologists. If this approach through semantic themes should prove to have been successful, it could be applied to other specialized vocabularies for elementary things and activities that our remotest ancestors must have talked about.</p>

            <p>We began by asking what lay behind the English word &#8216;toadstool&#8217;. In the course of our inquiry we discovered several attributes common to wild fungi and toads. The peoples of the North Sea basin think of both tribes &#8212; fungi and amphibia &#8212; as venomous. Over a broader area and running back deeper into the past, the peoples of northern Europe think of fungi and toads as organisms that <a name="distension-8">swell up</a>, and also as <a name="excrement-4">dunglike vermin</a>. We find that both toads and fungi inspire revulsion and fear, and naturally our ancestors considered them instinct with evil spirits. Both are slimy and mucoid. Fungi are tumor-like, clodlike; and toads are misshapen growths, foul and ugly. Fungi are <a name="aphrodisiac-5">aphrodisiacs</a>, and toads are lecherous. Both suggest the idea of procreation, in a variety of ways. On a larger stage, we have found that in the cultures of Europe, where deadly serpents are few, the toad is the indigenous equivalent of the serpent of the East. Eve&#8217;s serpent, exercising its horrid and fearsome spell, was a creature of the East. In the eastern Mediterranean the two creatures competed for dominion over men&#8217;s souls, but in the West the toad was supreme. The &#8216;toadstool&#8217; of the West emerges as the mycological and cultural equivalent of the <i>ahi-chattra(ka)</i> or &#8216;snake&#8217;s parasol&#8217; of the Sanskrit writings. A common fund of words for all these ideas is drawn upon, in the various Indo-European languages, to refer to the fungi, and also to toads, and when in a given language the same or similar words are drawn down from the common fund for the two orders of creatures, the peoples speaking that language associate toads and fungi together, and by reason of the words that overlap, and the common attributes,</p>

            <p>their feelings toward them take on the same tone. Similar metaphorical transfers appear to be indigenous also in human societies far removed from the Indo-European world.</p>

            <p>But behind the interweaving of these innumerable words and ideas, there lies the Mystery of the <a name="demonic-possession-4">divine mushrooms</a>. We have now learned that many species of these strange growths possess a power such as early man could only have regarded as miraculous. Indeed they may have given to him the very idea of the miraculous, and inspired many of the themes that come down to us in our heritage of folklore. Mushrooms were doubly associated with <a name="fire-3">fire</a>. They were used as primary tinder in that miracle of divine copulation, the generation of fire by the fire-drill, and the divine mushrooms were the offspring of the union of the <a name="lightning-4">Lightning Bolt</a> with the Mother Earth. We have suggested that the divine mushrooms played a vital part in shaking loose early man&#8217;s imagination, in arousing his capacity for self-perception, for awe, wonder, and reverence. They certainly made it easier for him to entertain the idea of God. In Europe the secret of the mushrooms was lost long ago, but it lingers on, fossilized and misunderstood, in our vocabulary, as when the Greeks spoke of mushrooms as the &#8216;<a name="gods-food-3">gods</a>&#8217; food&#8217;, the Flemings of &#8216;<a name="devils-bread-4">devils&#8217; bread</a>&#8217;, the demonic <i>crapaudin</i> of France, the demonic &#8216;toad&#8217;s stool&#8217; of the English, yes and the &#8216;<a name="flies-6">fly</a>&#8217; of the German <i>Fliegenschwamm</i>. Our legacy of mycophobia, what is it but a simple tabu, the aftermath of the emotional hold of those mushrooms on our own ancestors? There were other hallucinogens in the vegetable world, but we think the mushrooms were primary.</p>

            <p>Men ordinarily think of words as combinations of sounds that can be visualized with the aid of letters, and listed alpabetically in dictionaries, and there neatly defined and ticketed with their histories. But the words in dictionaries correspond only to &#8216;stills&#8217; in photography: the dictionaries catch them in a given posture, at a particular moment in time and space. This is true even of the largest dictionaries, which try to cover meanings over centuries and which cite a few out-croppings of the same word in other languages; for the center of gravity even in these big dictionaries is still in a single language, and therefore their angle of vision is self-centered and Ptolemaic. Moreover, no dictionary can hope to deal with all of the subtle semantic associations, and all the gradations of feeling, that the sound (which is the word made manifest) evokes. But these associations and feelings are the life and soul of the word, of which current usage in a single community may be only a passing phase. A word is a thin thread of sound coming down to us from earliest human times, a sound passed on from mouth to mouth, slowly changing, assuming different contours in the mouths of different communities, each of these variants remaining a strand of the original thread, these different strands plaited in and out among themselves, tangling with other threads of similar sounds but different meanings; impalpable, visible (through writing) only in recent millennia and until yesterday only to a few; thin as air; but solidly joined in the alembic of the human mind to particular perceptions of the senses and keyed to particular feelings; this link between sound on the one hand, and meaning and feeling on the other, displaying a tough continuity down the river of time and across vast stretches of diverse cultural expression, a continuity that stands in amazing contrast with the airy nothing of the words themselves. Words are a secretion peculiar to the human organism, and though uttered through a localized vocal mechanism, a secretion attuned to the whole organism.</p>

            <p>A.E. Housman in his famous Leslie Stephen lecture on the nature of poetry startled his public by asserting that for him great poetry was measurable by physiological reflexes. The shiver down his spine, his beard that bristled at the thought of great lines while he was shaving, the catch in his throat, sudden activity in his lachrymal ducts &#8212; these were his poetical touchstones. Could he not have carried his idea further? Was he not fixing his attention only on those rare conjunctures of grosser reflexes that are the fruit of the greatest utterances? In less degree does not every word possess its visceral counterpart, emanating from the pit of the stomach but registering itself in localized manifestations &#8212; in the stimulation or inhibition of glandular activity or incipient muscular twitches, in sights or sounds perceived only by the mind&#8217;s eye or mind&#8217;s ear, in imaginary tactile or olfactory or gustatory sensations? Teeth are set on edge by sour grapes, and also by hearing sour grapes mentioned, and even by the silent passage of those two words through the attuned mind. Perhaps in the long run the stability that is the astonishing property of words is traceable to the solar plexus, to this conditioned reflex, which is the obverse side of the audible entity. The great speaker or writer &#8212; the composer or conductor &#8212; is the master who manipulates these responses with supreme artistry, playing on the human instruments that are his audience, the instruments knowing they are in ecstasy but blissfully unaware of the infinitely subtle physiological wherefore. Here is a sense in which the kingdom of heaven is within us; and the music of the spheres turns out to be a physiological symphony. Let not this reflection disturb the believer in a Supreme Architect, for the ultimate enigma always remains close by, and man&#8217;s most searching inquiries are always confined within the bounds of the flexible but impenetrable envelope of the unknown, of that dark, distensible womb that is our prison and our Eden.</p>

            <p>By assaying the words used among various peoples for the fungi, we have perhaps suggested reasons for the mycophobia that afflicts most of the Western peoples. The semantic associations of these words, their emotional coloring, are rooted in the fears and beliefs of our ancestors in the earliest ages, perhaps when they were what we call Palaeolithic men. We study them objectively by digging up their artifacts and applying the highest order of intelligent curiosity to these old stones. But within ourselves, in our emotional responses, in our words that come down from long ago, we bear within us as part of us the evidence for a subjective understanding of those our forebears. Our elementary words with their emotional evocation are oral artifacts descended from those remote times, and like palimpsests occasionally permit themselves to be read layer beneath layer. Our words are a repertory of wood-notes wild, if only we attune ourselves to the faint descant that rises from them. How amusing it has been to discover in mycophobia the willing, nay determined, subservience of many Europeans to a simple tabu such as we like to associate with primitive peoples, a subservience to emotional responses that seem to stem back to the day when our ancestors found themselves face to face with the miraculous powers of the sacred mushroom! The secret lost, the tabu survives. Like the tribes that our anthropologists study, we cling to our own tabus and seek to justify them by rationalizing them. Few men want freedom, however they may talk. But then again perhaps man is free in his choice when he chooses to abide within the confines of his unreason.</p>
