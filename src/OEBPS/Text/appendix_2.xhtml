            <p><span class="initial">T</span>he following essay, by Sergej Timofeevich Aksakov, appeared in 1856 in the <i>Vestnik Estestvennykh Nauk</i>, the publication of a group of nature students who constituted the Moscow Imperial Society. Aksakov was a Russian country squire whose <i>Memoirs</i> are classics of Russian literature, valued alike for their honest and detailed picture of daily life in a by-gone world and for the lovable self-portrait that their author unconsciously paints. His forgotten paper on mushrooms possesses in rich measure the virtues that made his major works famous, and in translating it we have tried our best to preserve the flavor of the original. On its first appearance nearly a century ago, the editor, K. F. Rouille, drew attention to what would be called today its ecological implications, which he referred to as nature&#8217;s &#8216;law of interrelations&#8217;. Specifically, Aksakov, though only an amateur, seems to have been precocious in insisting on a biological tie between certain fungi and the roots of some kinds of trees. The peasants in the Slavic lands from time immemorial and recently the mycologists of the West had observed that some mushroom species are always found close to certain kinds of trees, but not until 1885 did A. B. Frank publish in <i>Berichte der Deutschen Botanischen Gesellschaft</i> the notable paper on <a name="truffle-15">truffles</a> that securely established the symbiotic kinship between trees and fungi &#8212; a relationship that came to be known as <a name="mycorrhiza-2">mycorrhiza</a>. Apparently Aksakov&#8217;s further observations concerning a difference in the growth of mushrooms on various sides of a given tree, according to the compass points, are unknown to mycologists. Was the behavior that he remarked peculiar to the trees in his grove, or was he calling attention to a significant phenomenon that others have overlooked to this day; &#8230; Here is Aksakov&#8217;s essay.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Among the sorts of hunting in which men engage, place must be made for the peaceful quest of mushrooms, or &#8216;mushroom-taking&#8217;. This cannot compare with other kinds of hunting that are more lively because they involve the animal world, but it can hold its own among many so-called secondary hunts, each of which offers its own interest. I give preference to mushroom-hunting because you must look for mushrooms and it follows that you may not find them. There is needed in addition a certain skill &#8212;&#8203; knowledge about where mushrooms grow, familiarity with the terrain &#8212;&#8203; and luck! No wonder that the proverb says, &#8220;With luck even mushroom-hunting is good.&#8221;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#appendix2-fn1" id="appendix2-r1">[1]</a></sup> In mushroom-hunting there are elements of the unknown, the unexpected; there is success and there is failure. These are the things that incite a man to the pursuit and give to it a special interest. The gathering of berries or nuts, also a hunt of the second class, at first glance might resemble mushroom-hunting, but on closer inspection we shall see that the latter possesses great advantages. Mushroom hunters will surely share my view, and with them I wish to have a chat and tell them of my observations over many years.</p>

        <p>Mushrooms are the most nourishing, tasty, and wholesome food, if they are not eaten to excess nor smothered in too much fat, but perfectly fried or boiled or thoroughly pickled in brine. Pickling in brine is employed with those mushrooms that are conserved in the raw state, such as those of the lactarius and russula families and others. For city folk mushrooms are a delicacy; to the country people they are food and in some regions a source of income. The mushroom is a child of the forest.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#appendix2-fn2" id="appendix2-r2">[2]</a></sup> The steppe has no mushrooms except the common field mushrooms and the <i>lugoviki</i> [marasmius oreades], and even these are born only in the fertilized soil of cattle-pens, pastures, and roads, and always close to the dwellings of men and cattle. It is known to all that if you raise trees in a bare field, either from seed or by transplanting, mushrooms will surely start growing there, the kind depending on the kind of trees. But, contrary to the opinion of many, the mysterious power of trees to bring forth mushrooms around themselves does not he merely in the shade that is produced by the branches. Shade is the first requisite, it is true, but only the first. Shade protects the earth from the scorching rays of the sun, produces humidity and even wetness in the soil, and this is essential for both the woods and the mushrooms. But their real source, it seems to me, lies in the roots of the trees, which humidifying in their turn the surrounding earth, impart to it the arboreal sap; and it is in the roots that in my opinion lies the key to the mystery of the birth of mushrooms. This is most convincingly shown by the fact that around stumps of trees where a certain species formerly grew in the life-giving shade, the same kind will continue to grow for as long as ten years or more. Roots die slowly. Finally they rot and dry, and the mushrooms cease. Many a time I have observed tree stumps standing quite far apart in meadows where the influence of neighboring trees could not be suspected. As proof of the fact that shade and moisture are not sufficient for the growth of mushrooms, one could point to certain species of trees such as the alder, black poplar, poplar, and bird-cherry [padus avium], under and near which no genuine mushrooms spring up. The complete dependence of mushrooms on the particular sap of a tree firmly establishes the fact that certain trees produce only their own kind of mushroom. If only moisture, shade, and coolness were needed, all kinds of mushrooms would grow under all kinds of trees.</p>

        <p>The country-folk recognize well the influence of trees over mushrooms and therefore have given to some of them names associated with trees, such as the birch-mushroom, the aspen-mushroom, the hazel-mushroom, the oak-mushroom.</p>

        <p>Mushrooms are divided between the edible and the inedible. The latter are generally called <i>poganki</i>, which includes poisonous mushrooms such as the <i>dubovik</i> [&#8217;oak-mushroom&#8217;, boletus luridus], the <i>mukhomor</i> [&#8217;fly-killer&#8217;, amanita muscaria], and others. Among the <i>poganki</i> are mushrooms that in some parts of Russia are considered poisonous, and elsewhere are considered good for food; for example, the <i>svinukhi</i> or &#8216;cow&#8217;s ears&#8217; [both names are Aksakov&#8217;s; a paxillus sp.]; <i>valui</i> [russula f≈ìtens]; <i>mochjonki</i> [&#8217;the sopping ones&#8217;;]; <i>chernukhi</i> [russula adusta]; etc. In order to be eaten without harm, these must be first parboiled or soaked and then salted. I even knew one man who, apart from the <i>mukhomor</i> and <i>dubovik</i>, considered all mushrooms edible, and as living evidence to support his faith in their innocence, he had himself and his family to show. He even asserted that the so-called <i>poganki</i> were as tasty as other mushrooms. This is hard to believe, because most <i>poganki</i> not only have an unpleasant color and appearance, but also smell bad.</p>

        <p>It is worthy of note that many edible or so-called &#8216;good&#8217; mushrooms have their counterpart in the <i>poganki</i>, somewhat resembling them in shape and color. Even more remarkable is the fact that when <i>poganki</i> make their appearance among good mushrooms, the latter begin to disappear. Finally the wave of good mushrooms passes, and the <i>poganki</i> complete the conquest of the site. This is especially true of mushrooms that grow up in large clusters, such as <i>masleniki</i> [various viscid boleti], <i>ryzhiki</i> [various lactarii], and <i>beljanki</i> [lactarius pubescens].</p>

        <p>All hunters know that mushrooms have their &#8216;favorite spots&#8217;, where each year they grow in varying quantity. No doubt there must be natural causes for this, but to an uninformed mind this phenomenon is striking and inexplicable. In a thick forest where the branches and the roots of the trees meet, it is hard to determine the places favored by mushrooms even if such places exist, but in open forests or clearings they are obvious and beyond doubt. I have a wood with two thousand oaks, old and young. The old ones numbering about 200 stand far apart in a large hay-field. Under certain of them, few in number, there have grown from time immemorial an immense quantity of caps of a somewhat distinctive form and size, unusually firm and strong, with caps of rare bronze and steel-like color, and sometimes multi-colored and shiny like marble. Their size and vigor are probably traceable to the nature of the root sap, and their color to the effects of sunlight, because oaks set far apart give little shade. Around the other oaks in the same clearing there are very few mushrooms, and around some, none at all. I have in my garden and park more than 300 spruces, and only under four of them do <i>ryzhiki</i> spring up. The location, the soil, the species of trees &#8212; all these are the same, and nevertheless for twelve years now I observe and yearly confirm my observation that my mushrooms are born exclusively in the same favorite spots under the same oaks and spruces.</p>

        <p>Different species of mushrooms coming up under different trees exhibit a remarkable trait in preferring to appear on the north side of the tree, much less often on the east and west sides, and on the south side, especially during a dry summer, they are almost totally absent. This influence of the four compass points and the position of the sun is best observed with the <i>ryzhiki</i>. The red <i>ryzhiki</i> [lactarius deliciosus?] around a given spruce always appear on the north side and halfway around to the east and west, whereupon, as if by a drawn line on approaching the south, their caps become greenish blue with a somewhat roughened surface, as though dried out; although the stem and the inside of the broken cap remain equally red and juicy. From this we see that the circumference of the tree is divided into equal sectors, the red <i>ryzhiki</i> being on the north side, the greenish on the south, while east and west are equally divided between both kinds, with the fewest specimens on the south side.</p>

        <p>There is no doubt that, as people believe, in rainy, soggy years mushrooms spring up in greater numbers, especially if bad weather is accompanied by warmth. But here too there are exceptions, not understood by the ordinary observer and only to be explained by science. I have often noticed that in spite of very warm air, rains may be harmful to mushrooms. At times this harmful effect works slowly and imperceptibly, but at times it acts with amazing rapidity, before your very eyes, especially with young mushrooms just emerging from the earth. Four times during the last twelve years I have seen devastation wrought by rain that fell apparently in conditions of propitious warmth. Twice the rain was accompanied by a sort of dry fog with a nasty burning smell; and twice the rains were downpours which thoroughly soaked the earth, with sunshine following immediately afterwards. Visiting every day about noon all the mushroom-bearing spots of my garden and park, there where on the eve I had left a host of young <a name="cep-13">ceps</a>, I was struck by the sudden change in their appearance. More or less all the young baby-mushrooms had become wrinkled and dried out, and the smallest ones, the size of a pea, and even those the size of a hazel-nut, had disappeared, and only a half-rotted dust, which was hard to identify, lay where the mushroom buds had been. Some of the more adult mushrooms revived and reached their usual size, but in a somewhat deformed shape. Others rotted away and collapsed. Such harmful effects were observed and recorded by me each time. A similar influence but noticeably slower is at times brought about by an excessive dew at night, which produces yellowish spots on the grass. Furthermore, let it here be set down that the current popular belief according to which a mushroom duly noted and marked by man will not grow up but will shrivel up, is, according to my observations, wholly unjust. I have always marked a goodly number of mushrooms, especially ceps, in order to gather them at the age which I consider most desirable, or else I leave them to reach their full development and beauty. I will not conceitedly assert that the gaze of man may not produce a magnetic influence in the vegetable world. All I can say is that my innumerable experiments led me to conclude that at least <i>my</i> glance never did any harm to mushrooms.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#appendix2-fn3" id="appendix2-r3">[3]</a></sup> I have even tried to touch the mushrooms lightly and free them from the leaves and grass which at times hamper their growth. I have gone so far as to break off bits of their caps, and they continued to grow as before. One thing is true: if you shake the stem of the mushroom, it wilts and perishes.</p>

        <p>In bad weather and toward fall the mushrooms give wider berth to the trees and more willingly grow along the edges of woods and on naked hills &#8212; they &#8216;leap away&#8217;, as the people express it; but in the dry and hot weather the mushrooms cling to the shade and even take shelter under the branches of the trees, especially the spruces that spread their branches like paws along the earth. That is why peasants call such branches <i>lapniki</i> [paws], and chop them off for various needs without mercy and without harm to the tree. They even assert that the spruce reaches its full size for lumber if you groom it by chopping down the lower branches.</p>

        <p>Apart from harmful rains and dew, mushrooms are damaged in clearings by the hot rays of the midday sun. Such rays scorch their caps, and although the coolness of the night, the dew, and an occasional rain freshen them up, the daily sun-burn makes them shrivel before they reach their full maturity. Lengthy and frequent rains in their turn damage the growth of mushrooms, especially in the shade, in thick grass and overgrown spots. The mushrooms rot, grow mouldy, and perish. They are also spoiled and destroyed by living enemies. Slugs and snails firmly attach themselves to mushrooms, eating and boring through the caps and stems. In years of poor mushroom harvests, it is rare to find one not harboring two or three slugs. Squirrels are also mushroom hunters, going out especially for ceps, and often you will find marks of sharp teeth on their chewed caps. But the worst pest of mushrooms is a small white worm. Some years there are so many that the stem of every cep, strong and healthy on the outside, is inevitably undermined inside, and falls to pieces if picked up carelessly or firmly. Fortunately the caps are the last to be attacked by worms, and often remain healthy and intact with the stem completely eaten away. It is surprising how mushrooms in such a condition continue to receive nourishment.</p>

        <p>The current notion that, especially after a rain, mushrooms spring up overnight, is not true. Nevertheless, it is true that at times one finds young mushrooms where none were seen the night before. They were there, however, but remained unnoticed, because they were hardly above the ground, and covered with leaves and grass. Those quickest to mature or rather to grow up, such as the <i>berjozoviki</i> [boletus scaber] and <i>syroezhki</i> [various russul√¶], reach full development in three days, but the ceps take a week or more. The slowest to grow is the <i>dubovik</i>, a worthless mushroom and even poisonous, as I said before.</p>

        <p>In good harvest years mushrooms may be seen in clusters and families. They even grow as twins or triplets or more. I speak of those mushrooms that usually grow single, such as the ceps, the birch-mushrooms, the aspen-mushrooms, etc. I once made a sketch of an aspen-mushroom that showed six stems covered by one cap. A superabundance of <a name="mycorrhiza-3">mycelium</a> and of the earth&#8217;s sap at times produces freakish and ugly forms. Once I found a russula with another russula growing out of its cap. I made a drawing of this curious monstrosity. More than once I have found in the earth large lumps of the mycelium of the cep, a mass much resembling a root and the size of a man&#8217;s head.</p>

        <p>This is the order of the appearance of mushrooms. As soon as it begins to thaw in the spring, the <a name="morel-24">morels</a> appear in the meadows and the open woods. At first the <i>glukhie</i> [&#8217;deaf ones&#8217;, an helvella], then the <i>strojki</i> [morchella esculenta]. They grow even under a crust of snow with water rushing beneath. After the morels a month elapses, or more if there is drought, during which there are no mushrooms whatever. Then come the <i>masljaniki</i>, <i>berjozoviki</i>, <i>syroezhki</i>, <i>osinoviki</i> [boletus versipellis], then the first wave of <i>gruzdi</i>, <i>podgruzdki</i> [various kinds of lactarii], and ceps; then follow the <i>lisichki</i> [<a name="chanterelle-6">chanterelles</a>], and field mushrooms; finally come the autumn mushrooms, viz., <i>volzhanki</i> [lactarius torminosus], <i>beljanki</i>, <i>ryzhiki</i>, and <i>opjonki</i>. This whole order is upset at times, and it always depends on the weather and the atmospheric influences. I must add that each species appears in two or three waves during summer and fall, and until frequent and strong frosts, especially during droughts, finally kill off the mushroom growth. Speaking of each species of mushroom separately, I shall tell in more detail of the occasional mutations in their growth.</p>

            <p>Aksakov&#8217;s essay ends here. Apparently he never returned to the subject, and his observations on growth &#8216;mutations&#8217; are lost to us. He died in 1859, three years after the publication of the paper. VPW.</p>
