  <p class="calibre1">JN ow the moment has arrived to examine the basic fungal words of Europe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The tie that joins toad and fungus continues to be our theme. But for a few</p>

  <p class="calibre1">paragraphs we shall immerse ourselves in evidence that may seem remote</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to our readers - if readers there be who are still with us. Some of that evidence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is well attested, but we are going to advance certain conjectures of our own,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and if perchance these survive competent scrutiny, we shall have succeeded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in discerning links between toads and fungi over a far wider area, and at a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">greater depth in time, than we would willingly have imagined when we asked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ourselves, at the outset, our innocent and casual question about the lowly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toadstool. As amateurs, we are rash in what we are about to do, and if we do</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not constantly qualify our probing remarks with locutions of modest timidity,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this is to spare the reader at the cost of our inclinations.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In 1901 the eminent philologist Holger Pedersen, then a young man, brought</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out a notable paper1 in which he established the etymological identity of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">basic fungal words that we are about to consider, despite the disparity in their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">looks. They circulate in all the languages of Europe, often two or three of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them in the same language. In the Germanic world we may take the High</p>

  <p class="calibre1">German <i class="calibre4">Schwamm</i> as our type; in the Slavic languages, the Russian <i class="calibre4">guba;</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Mediterranean world there is the Latin <i class="calibre4">fungus</i> and the Greek σπόγγος,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'sponge'. Only in the Celtic languages have we found no native examples.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Germanic and Slavic the words mean both fungus and sponge. In the Medi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terranean, by semantic differentiation the Greeks confined their word to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sponge, and the Romans theirs to the fungus, the Romans borrowing the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greek word for the other sense.2 There is no evidence that any of these words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in recorded history has ever been linked in the minds of Europeans with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toad. But there is abundant evidence that all of these words have carried, in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their very core, the idea of an organic swelling or excrescence or tumor. Thus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Greeks spoke of scrofula and of the tonsils as sponges, and parallel examples</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are common for the other words of the group.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is one remarkable quality that distinguishes all the words of our sponge</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cluster: they are emotionally neutral, by contrast with the pejorative flavor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the fungal words heretofore discussed. It is as though this whole family</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_46">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">of words had always possessed a tough underlying personality persisting through</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the centuries, over immense areas, among peoples in every stage of cultural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">development. Even when a word of this group describes something disagreeable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like a tumor, it retains a detached tone, by contrast for example with 'cancer'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the English language the Anglo-Saxons used <i class="calibre4">swamm</i> for 'mushroom',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and this member of our sponge cluster lingered on through Middle English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into early Modern English. We can pinpoint its last recorded appearance:</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Fig. 6</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">DESCRIPTION OF FOMES</p>

  <p class="calibre1">OFFICINALIS</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ofswamm</i> (misspelled <i class="calibre4">swamp)</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the sense of mushroom,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">referring to fungal growth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on larch.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the second edition of <i class="calibre4">Naturall Philosophy or A Description of the World,</i> by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Daniel Widdowes, published in London in 1631, where it is used in describing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fomes officinalis, the <i class="calibre4">agaricum</i> of Pliny. <i class="calibre4">Swamm</i> in the end surrendered the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">field to the loathsome 'toadstool', to the toothsome 'mushroom', and to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">learned 'fungus'. But another word of our cluster is current in the name that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English give to wet, spongy land - the swamp. And perhaps there survives yet</p>

  <p class="calibre1">another word, of greater importance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On an earlier page we saw that the idea lying behind the <i class="calibre4">pogge</i> cluster was a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">distensible sac, a bag or pocket or pouch, a belly or bulge or bilge. The English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word 'womb' comes down from the Anglo-Saxon <i class="calibre4">wamb,</i> and this in turn</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is cognate with various Germanic words of similar sound and meaning, includ-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing the Gothic <i class="calibre4">wamba.</i> As the Oxford Dictionary points out, the same root</p>

  <p class="calibre1">turns up in the rare word 'gameson', designating the quilted or padded garment</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that medieval knights wore under their armor to avoid chafing. This garment</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tended to bulge and belly, being designed to do so. Philologists have been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">106</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SPONGE CLUSTER</p>

  <p class="calibre1">uncertain about the ultimate affiliations of the underlying root of 'womb'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and 'gameson'. We suggest that 'womb' and our sponge cluster spring from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same source, and that in 'womb' and the sponge cluster we discover a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perfect semantic parallel for those elements in the <i class="calibre4">pogge</i> cluster that relate to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">distensible bags and fungi, and also for the Irish fungal <i class="calibre4">bolg.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps there is another extraordinary example, hitherto unidentified, of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same Indo-European root in Late Latin. During the early centuries of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Christian era the Roman legions were being hard pressed by the barbarian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">horsemen erupting out of Asia. In the art of warfare the innovation of the day</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was the cavalry, and the Roman authorities were struggling to overtake the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alarming lead of the enemy in the handling of horses. Whenever they could,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they incorporated into their own forces barbarian elements versed in horseman-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ship. It is not surprising that at this time important texts by veterinaries make</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their appearance in Latin. One of these veterinaries, Vegetius by name, writ-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing in the early 5th century, describes a pathological swelling above the hoof</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a horse by the adjective <i class="calibre4">gambosus,</i> the first recorded appearance of this word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Latin. Surely this is our familiar <i class="calibre4">gamba,</i> borrowed from the barbarians,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">used in its essential sense of 'swelling', under historical circumstances that make</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its appearance natural.1 (There is a curious and significant analogy for <i class="calibre4">gamba,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the sense that we suggest, in the modern Dutch word <i class="calibre4">hanekam,</i> of which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the primary sense is 'cock's comb'. It carries two other meanings: it is the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vulgar name of the chanterelle, and it also designates a swelling on the hock</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a horse.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The words of our sponge cluster have displayed a singular potency in grafting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">themselves into the vocabularies of alien peoples. Thus in Basque one of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">three generic words for mushrooms is <i class="calibre4">ondo,</i> borrowed from the Spanish <i class="calibre4">hongo,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">which in turn descends from the Latin <i class="calibre4">fungus.</i> (This borrowing, must have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been relatively recent - in the course of the past millennium or so. Of more</p>

  <p class="calibre1">subtle interest is the fact that the Basque word for 'toad', <i class="calibre4">apo,</i> possesses as a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">secondary meaning the idea of sponginess. We shall revert to this.) The Magyar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. This etymology, original with us, must stand up against the conventional one. French <i class="calibre4">jambe</i> and Italian</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">gamba,</i> 'leg', are usually traced through Vegetius' <i class="calibre4">gamba</i> to a Celtic root meaning 'bend' or 'curve'. That the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words for 'leg' come from the Celtic root we do not question. It is less clear why a veterinary writing in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">5th century should refer to a swelling on a horse's leg as a 'leg' or as a 'bend'. We know that there was a close</p>

  <p class="calibre1">homonym for the Celtic word in Germanic and Slavic, that homonym meaning 'swelling' or 'tumor' or 'womb'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We are not inventing a homonym for our argument. If we are right, the form of the word as used by Vegetius</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would indicate that it was borrowed, not from Germanic, but from Slavic, and this would confer on <i class="calibre4">gamba</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the distinction of being the earliest recorded loan-word from Slavic in the Western languages. Heretofore the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">earliest recorded Slavic word is <i class="calibre4">strava,</i> 'funeral banquet', used by Jordanis in his account of the funeral of Attila</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in A.D. 453. For the crisis in war technology precipitated by the barbarians' use of the horse, see the opening pages</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Ferdinand Lot's <i class="calibre4">L'Art Militaire et les Armies du Moyen Age, Pans,</i> 1946.</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_103"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_47">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">gomba</i> or <i class="calibre4">gamba</i> was drawn from the Slavic, as was we believe the Lappish</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">guobbar.</i> In Armenian our sponge cluster turns up in <i class="calibre4">sunk,</i> meaning mushroom,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and this Armenian word was the source of the Georgian <i class="calibre4">soko,</i> which in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">neighboring Svanetian language becomes <i class="calibre4">sok.</i> On the northern side of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Caucasus the Ossetians speaking the Ironian dialect of their language borrowed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their word <i class="calibre4">zoko</i> from the Georgians, and by a not abnormal transposition,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the other Ossetians of the Digorian tongue say <i class="calibre4">kozo -</i> a far cry from <i class="calibre4">Schwamm</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">and fungus</i> perhaps, yet genetically stemming from the same ancestry.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the valley of the Volga, to the east of the Slavic homelands, there live</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Chuvash people. They are probably the descendants of the original Bulgars.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When a part of the tribe, some fifteen centuries ago, began their slow trek to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the land that we now call Bulgaria, the others remained behind and they retain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to this day their non-Indo-European tongue. In the Chuvash language the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word for 'fungus' is <i class="calibre4">kampa.</i> The nasal sound in the middle of that word is of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">singular interest. The Chuvashi could have borrowed <i class="calibre4">kampa</i> only from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eastern Slavs, who for a thousand years and perhaps more, ever since the Russian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">language was first put on parchment, have been saying <i class="calibre4">guba.</i> The Chuvash</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word offers proof that long ago, when the Chuvash people took over the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word - we cannot say when this happened - the Russian <i class="calibre4">guba</i> was pronounced</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">gomba.</i> Like the fly caught and held in amber, the Chuvashi have held for us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the ancient and lost form of the Russian word. That Chuvash word is note-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">worthy also for its other meanings. It is used for certain tumors of the human</p>

  <p class="calibre1">body. It is also used for the genitalia of the cow, and thus recalls the Gothic</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">wamba</i> and the English 'womb'.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Indo-Aryan languages of the Middle East and India there is a startling</p>

  <p class="calibre1">family of words that seem both phonetically and semantically to belong to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our sponge cluster. Thus in Hindi we find that <i class="calibre4">khumbi</i> means 'mushroom';</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Sindhi, <i class="calibre4">khumbhi;</i> in Panjabi, <i class="calibre4">khumb;</i> in Lahnda, <i class="calibre4">khumb.</i> These are all traceable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to a Sanskrit word, <i class="calibre4">kumbhika,</i> meaning 'pot' or jar' - the bellying utensil that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we have already encountered in the Anglo-Saxon <i class="calibre4">bile,</i> meaning both 'belly'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and 'pitcher'. In Sindhi we also find <i class="calibre4">phungi,</i> which is seemingly a mutation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by metathesis of <i class="calibre4">khumbhi,</i> paralleling the identical mutation in Europe, where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'sponge' <i class="calibre4">and gomba</i> are identical etymologically, as are <i class="calibre4">Schwamm and fungus.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Waziri dialect of the Afghan language known as Pashto we find for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'mushroom' the word <i class="calibre4">xomba, and</i> in the Mohmand dialect <i class="calibre4">xumburi,</i> both de-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rived from <i class="calibre4">xumb,</i> 'pot'. Surely all these words bear witness to the ubiquity of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. Our information about the Chuvash <i class="calibre4">kampa</i> comes from N. I. Ashmarin's <i class="calibre4">Thesaurus Linguce Tschuvaschorum,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Book vii, p. 142, published in 1934.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">108</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SPONGE CLUSTER</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the idea that underlies the thinking about fungi throughout the Indo-European</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world, and of the verbal root that expresses the idea. These Eastern words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stir up a further reflection. A few pages back, when we were discussing the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pogge</i> cluster, we saw how Puck and other imps and sprites resided in the disten-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sible sacs, the toads, and the puffballs that we were examining. If we may rely</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the Arabian Nights, the jinn of the East were confined in pots and jars,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whence they would escape, rising wraith-like in gaseous wisps, to condense</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into organic shapes and wreak their will on men. Is there here too a common</p>

  <p class="calibre1">denominator in the Satanic association of the fungi, linking the East with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Europe?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Up to this point we have shown the diffusion of our basic fungal words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">throughout the Indo-European world and among a few small adjacent tribes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of other origins. How about the Semitic peoples; Here we uncover a surprising</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thing. Of the important words for 'mushroom' in Arabic, one is <i class="calibre4">kam</i> or <i class="calibre4">kam'a.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Its etymology is unknown. It belongs both to classical or literary Arabic and to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the colloquial language. In its application it is both generic and specific, some-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times embracing the whole mushroom world, but also designating that species</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of terfezia which among Arabs holds pride of place as a gustatory delight. It is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reported in modern Persian, where loan words from Arabic are numerous,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in its specific sense is said to be commonly used by the market vendors of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Damascus. Nor is this root confined to Arabic. In the Old Testament no word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for 'mushroom' occurs, but in the Babylonian Talmud and the Midrashic li-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terature we find the cognate root KMH in both Aramaic and Hebrew forms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If our Semitic root was borrowed from the Indo-European world, it goes back</p>

  <p class="calibre1">far.1 Or are both words descended from a pre-Indo-European root? Or are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we dealing with unrelated words that happen to resemble each other?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now we return to Pedersen's classic paper.2 He undertook to reconstruct</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. The Arabic <i class="calibre4">kam'</i> suggests the Germanic and Slavic forms of the Indo-European words, rather than the Greek</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or Latin. In the Jerusalem Talmud we find the root SPG in the form <i class="calibre4">s'fog</i> meaning 'a porous luxuriant growth,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom, sponge', but this was undoubtedly a Hellenistic borrowing of the Greek σπόγγος The parallel</p>

  <p class="calibre1">between the Arabic and Russian words for 'mushroom' reminds us of an astonishing parallel in fungal metaphors.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A certain mushroom is called in Arabic <i class="calibre4">shahinat al-ard,</i> literally 'fat-of-the-earth'. This corresponds to the Russian</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">maslenok,</i> which James Collins in <i class="calibre4">The Present State of Russia</i> translated by 'fat-of-the-earth' in the iSth century.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yet another basic fungal word in Arabic, classical and colloquial, is <i class="calibre4">faq', fuqqa', orfaqqd",</i> from the root <i class="calibre4">FQ',</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning 'whiteness'. Whether this name designates a white kind of mushroom, or whether, as in Russian and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Basque fungal names, whiteness here connotes excellence, we do not know. See pp. 7 and 10.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">2.</i> Pedersen's careful and elaborate argument in favor of a common origin for Slavic <i class="calibre4">gomba,</i> German <i class="calibre4">Schwamm,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Latinfungus,</i> and Greek σπόγγος seems to us conclusive, and is accepted in substance by Emile Boisacq in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greek etymological dictionary. A. Ernout and A. Meillet in their Latin etymological dictionary suggest a Medi</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terranean origin for the Latin and Greek words, without however dealing with Pedersen's argument, which is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">available only in Polish. Occasionally there are clusters of words that the philologist ought to study together,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and such is the fungal vocabulary of Europe, a semantic field pervaded by related figures of speech and emo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tional responses. No philologist has pursued this method. Our basic fungal words of northern and southern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">109</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_105"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_48">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">the lost Indo-European root that was the progenitor of our sponge cluster. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">considered several possibilities differing only in details, and of these 'sgwombho'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">may be considered typical. And at this precise point, after a long absence, our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toad rears its head and thrusts itself once more into the stream of our argument.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Curious about the origin of the Latin word for toad, <i class="calibre4">bufo,</i> we turned to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Walde's Latin etymological dictionary, and discovered to our surprise that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">philologists are disposed to consider it genetically related to the Russian word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for toad, <i class="calibre4">zhaba,</i> through an intermediate form, <i class="calibre4">gabawo,</i> found in the dead</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Baltic language known as Old Prussian. For <i class="calibre4">bufo</i> Walde devises a hypothetical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indo-European ancestor, 'guobho'. Thus leading scholars, without regard for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">each other's problem, arrive at hypothetical archetypes:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[sjgwombho as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the ancestor for 'fungus' and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">guobh5</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the ancestor for <i class="calibre4">bufo,</i> which thus differ in only one essential respect - the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">presence of the nasal infix in the word for mushroom! Though we are the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">first to propose that these two words are doublets distinguished only by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nasal infix, the Indo-European languages offer other examples that parallel ours</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perfectly.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This ancestral convergence of the two words could be regarded as accidental,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">provoking perhaps an ancient semantic overlap through paronomasia or pun-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ning, were it not for the weight of evidence that we have already developed,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">indicating an association of toads with fungi in the minds of primitive Europeans.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the face of this evidence, accident becomes the long and unlikely arm of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coincidence. Perhaps traces of the underlying unity of <i class="calibre4">zhaba</i> and <i class="calibre4">gamba</i> survive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the vernacular terms of the Ukraine and Slovakia that we cited on page 78.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps there is a trace of that unity, hidden behind translated words, in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Basque word for 'toad', <i class="calibre4">apo,</i> linked as it is semantically with both 'sponginess'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and certain wild mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">According to Pedersen's analysis, <i class="calibre4">Schwamm</i> and <i class="calibre4">gamba</i> differ from the Latin</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">fungus</i> and <i class="calibre4">spongia</i> only by a transposition of consonants, the common pheno-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Europe possess identical semantic attributes. They mean the same things— organic excrescence, sponge, fungus.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They evoke identical turns of phrase, proverbs, epithetical use. In short, the words occupy the same semantic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terrain, which would be unh'kely if they descended from unrelated sources. We offer this as additional evidence,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">circumstantial in character, in support of the Pedersen thesis. As we shall see on p. 144, this does not altogether</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rule out the possibility that the same root is native to languages outside the Indo-European family. In short,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">both Pedersen and the Latin philologists could conceivably be right.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. The interested reader will find a detailed survey of such nasal infixation in the book of the distinguished</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Polish linguist Jan Otr^bski, 2 <i class="calibre4">Baddn ttad infikscm nosowym u&gt; jgzykach indoeuropejskich,</i> published by the Polish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Academy of Sciences as the I5th issue of the Transactions of its Linguistic Commission, Krakow, 1929.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I I O</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SPONGE CLUSTER</p>

  <p class="calibre1">menon known as metathesis. Thus <i class="calibre4">gamba</i> becomes <i class="calibre4">[s]pongos</i> in Greek. Pedersen</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chose to reconstruct his Indo-European archetype, the hypothetical 'sgwombho',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the northern forms. But was he justified in this; The northern forms have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shown themselves fluid throughout the fifteen centuries of their recorded history.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Greek σπόγγος attested in Homer, has displayed a notable stability through-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out the twenty-five centuries of its recorded history. May we not suppose</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the Greek word is nearer to the archetype? If so, we suggest our own recon-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">struction of the hypothetical root:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(s)p(h)ong-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And at this point the attentive reader will perceive that we are back in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">company of those words that we associate with the Low German <i class="calibre4">pogge,</i> mean-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing 'frog' and 'toad', the essential difference being the nasal infix that distin-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">guishes all words of the sponge cluster.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And so we now emerge from our arduous excursion among the words of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the sponge cluster with a theory of our own. We believe that these words -</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Schivamm, gamba, fungus</i> σπόγγος - stem from the same genetic root as the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">basic word 'womb', and that all these stem from the same genetic root as the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words of the <i class="calibre4">pogge</i> cluster. That root was imitative in origin, and keyed to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the idea of swelling. The progeny of that root has peopled the vocabularies</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Europe with numerous words embracing bags, pockets, toads and frogs,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">imps, tumors, mushrooms, wombs, and sponges.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Just as physicists discover the 'unified field' where, at great depth, the disparate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phenomena of matter and force turn out to be one and the same, so in our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">linguistic pursuit we may have arrived at the unified field underlying all of those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">disparate phenomena that, as we have seen, men associate together, subtly and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">half unconsciously, to this very day.</p>
