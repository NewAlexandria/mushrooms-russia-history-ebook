        <h1>Notes on the e-book edition</h1>

        <p>This e-book edition was compiled and typeset by&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kit@nocturne.net.nz">Bayard Randel &lt;kit@nocturne.net.nz&gt;</a>&nbsp;. It was&nbsp;derived from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newalexandria.org/archive/">New Alexandria Archive</a>&nbsp;digital edition pdf, which was scanned from the original copy no. 37, and hand corrected by Igor Dolgov, Zachary Jones, and Greg Golden.</p>

        <h2>Changes from the original text</h2>

        <p>In order to adapt this work to e-book formats, a number of changes have been made:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>While <i>Mushrooms, Russia and History</i> was originally published in two volumes, both volumes are presented here as a single e-book for convenience. References to volumes in the text have been removed.</li>

            <li>As e-book page layouts are fluid and device dependant, the position of figures and plates have been changed to improve clarity.</li>

            <li>Footnotes are rendered at the end of chapters and numbered per chapter rather than per page.</li>

            <li>References to page numbers from the original text have been removed. Links instead are provided from appendicies and indicies.</li>
        </ol>

            Where possible I have endeavoured to edit and correct errors in the text which presumably resulted from errors in OCR. Unfortunately I do not possess, nor know of an original copy of&nbsp;<i>Mushrooms, Russia and History&nbsp;</i>available for reference in New Zealand to ensure the absolute parity of this edition with the original text. Please feel free to contact me with corrections.
