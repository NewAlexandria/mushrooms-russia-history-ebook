  <p class="calibre1">VS/ith the concluding words of the previous section we had thought to end our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discussion of the divine mushrooms. But in 1955 we returned again to Mexico</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to push our inquiries, and, at last breaking through the barrier of native shyness,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we penetrated into the mushroom cult much more deeply than before, eating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mushrooms ourselves as participants in a communal agape. We experienced</p>

  <p class="calibre1">subjectively for the first time what we had previously been able to describe only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as witnesses from the outside or at second hand by the testimony of informants.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Just as our book goes to press we add the following notes on our 1955 adventures.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Friday, June 24, VPW, Masha, and RGW flew to Mexico City. We in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stalled ourselves in a small villa in San Angel, at Reyna 9, which we had rented</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with servants as a base for our excursions. Thither we could return and relax in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the quiet of a lovely garden, the high walls festooned with blooming bougain-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">villea, after our sorties into the Indian country. Two days later Allan Richardson</p>

  <p class="calibre1">joined us, to serve again as our photographer, and on Monday he and RGW set</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out for the heart of the Mazatec country. By Tuesday night we were bedded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">down with a Mazatec family in one of the villages of that remote world in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">northern Oaxaca. On this trip Robert Weitlaner was prevented by other duties</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from accompanying us, and we therefore considered ourselves doubly fortunate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when almost at once, in a new circle of Indians, we found ourselves received</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as friends.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We shall call our host Cayetano and his wife Guadalupe. Intelligent, vigorous,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and gentle, this couple, in their thirties, were the key to the success of our ex-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pedition. As soon as RGW imparted to them in confidence his interest in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sacred mushrooms, they pledged their cooperation, and they more than made</p>

  <p class="calibre1">good their pledge.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cayetano and Guadalupe's house is on the outskirts of Huautla de Jimenez</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and opens directly on the village thoroughfare that runs along a mountain-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">side. With roof of thatch and adobe walls, it has two storeys. You enter on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">upper level from the street, and then by a small trap-door in one corner you</p>

  <p class="calibre1">climb down a steep and twisting stairway to the floor below, where the events</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that we shall relate took place. This lower storey is built on one side against the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mountain face, and on the other side by a door it opens on a terrace perhaps six</p>

  <p class="calibre1">feet wide, which then falls sharply away to the ravine hundreds of feet below.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">287</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_74"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_37">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Across the valley and beyond, the Sierra Mazateca in all its verdant glory fills</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the distant view. On the terrace at one end of the house a flimsy wooden and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thatch annex has been constructed to serve as kitchen. The interior is divided</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by a whitewashed adobe wall into two rooms. There is no window in either</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room, but over the door on the terrace an aperture allows in some light. This</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room was well sheltered from the life of the village, and doubly so at night when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mazatec villagers refrain from stirring abroad. The family circle was large:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our hosts' small children were numerous, and Cayetano's brothers and parents</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were also much in evidence, as well as other kin. Chickens and turkeys had the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">run of the lower floor. A hen sitting on her eggs on one of the cluttered tables</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was a silent witness to all that went on.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the day after our arrival, early in the afternoon of Wednesday June 29,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cayetano and his brother Genaro took us down the mountain side to the edge</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the stream in the gully. In the lower reaches of our descent we skirted a field</p>

  <p class="calibre1">planted to sugar cane, and then arrived at the spot where it is the custom to mill</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the cane, a flat space the size of a threshing floor, thick with rotting bagasse, as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the refuse from the mill is called. There in the bagasse, just as Cayetano had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">promised, we found an immense crop of mushrooms, of the sacred kind known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to our Mazatec friends as <i class="calibre4">ki3so\</i> 'landslide'. We photographed them to our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hearts' content. We gathered them in a pasteboard box: the sacred mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must always be carried in a closed parcel, never exposed to the view of passers-by.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They were a noble lot, mostly young, all of them perfect in their moist health</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and fragrance. Then we carried them up the steep mountain side to the house.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We were warned that if we saw any dead animal on the way, the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would lose their virtue â€” happily we saw none. It was in the rainy season, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the humid heat of that sunny afternoon the climb was long and exhausting.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hardly had we arrived back when Cayetano sent us, with his brother Emilio</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as interpreter, to a cottage some distance farther up, where he said we would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">find a <i class="calibre4">curandera de primera categoria,</i> a <i class="calibre4">cumndera</i> of the first class, Maria Sabina by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name. We were to ask her whether she would help us that night. We found</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Seiiora, as our hosts always called her, resting on a <i class="calibre4">petate,</i> or mat made of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">certain palm. She was alone with a daughter who was up and about. After</p>

  <p class="calibre1">introducing ourselves through Emilio, we showed them our mushrooms, where-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">upon the two women went into raptures over their fine condition and beauty.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We put our question to the Senora, and without hesitation, looking steadily at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us, she said yes. Neither she nor her daughter spoke a word of Spanish. We do</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not know whether they had been told to expect our visit.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Maria Sabina is a woman in her fifties, grave in demeanor, with a grave smile,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">288</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">short of stature like all Mazatecs, dressed in the Mazatec <i class="calibre4">huipil.</i> Her daughter is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in her thirties and in all respects takes after her mother. She is following her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mother's vocation. The Senora herself is at the peak of her powers, and it is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">easy to see why Guadalupe had said to us of her that she was <i class="calibre4">una Senora sin</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">mancha,</i> a lady without blemish, immaculate, one who had never dishonored her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">calling by using her powers for evil. She alone, said Guadalupe, had brought</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the latter's children through all the diseases that take a frightful toll in early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">childhood in the Mazatec country. After that initial talk we were to pass two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all-night vigils with Dona Maria and her daughter, and we can testify that she</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is a woman of rare moral and spiritual power, dedicated in her vocation, an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">artist in her mastery of the techniques of her office. It was her example that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drove home for us for the first time a rule that must govern all field anthro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pologists. In the archaic cultures as among advanced peoples, there is a hierarchy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of excellence when it comes to the individuals who are the culture-bearers. It</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is not sufficient to rely on the first informants that present themselves, on any</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shaman who is willing to talk. The whole cultural area must be discreetly sur-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">veyed and communication must be established with the finest exponents of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">old traditions. None of the formidable difficulties of physical existence in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these remote regions nor of communication should be permitted to blunt this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">obligation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On that last Wednesday of June, after nightfall, we gathered in the lower</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chamber of Cayetano's house. In all, at one time or another, there must have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been twenty-five persons present, mostly members old and young of Cayetano's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">family. The Senora came with her daughter Polonia. They and all the others</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were pleased when we photographed them, and we took numerous pictures</p>

  <p class="calibre1">throughout the preliminaries. But the Senora requested through Cayetano</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that when the power would seize her â€” <i class="calibre4">cuando la fuerza le aganara</i> â€” we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should desist, and of course we did so. Cayetano served us chocolate to drink,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">somewhat ceremonially. (RGW's thoughts went back to Sahagiin in the l6th</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century, who had said that chocolate was served before the mushrooms were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">taken. Cayetano also offered us coffee and sweet wheaten bread, neither of which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had been known to his ancestors in pre-Conquest Mexico.) Both Allan Richard-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">son and RGW were deeply impressed by the mood of the gathering. We were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">received and the night's events unrolled in an atmosphere of simple friendliness</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that reminded us of the agape of early Christian times. There was no familiarity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The mushrooms were treated respectfully, as sacred, but without marked for-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mality. The proceedings went forward with an easy decorum. Neither on this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">occasion nor at any other time or place did we ever see or hear the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">289</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_76"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_38">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">treated as a subject for jocular vulgarity, of the kind that often marks the use of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alcohol among fully civilized peoples. The atmosphere of respectful friendliness</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was infectious, and we enjoyed reciprocating the welcome extended to us. There</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is no record that any white men had ever attended a session of the kind that we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are going to describe, nor that white men had ever partaken of the sacred mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms under any circumstances. For reasons deeply rooted in the mortal cul-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tural conflict of Spaniards and Indians, it is unlikely that any unrecorded event</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the kind had ever taken place. By hearsay the early Spanish writers had re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ported gatherings of Indians where the mushrooms were served to many, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we had thought from our previous visits to Mexico that such observances were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">today unknown. We were now to learn that they still go on, and that they are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">even today a central experience in the culture of the Mazatec people. The only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">change is that the gatherings now are held behind closed doors. Cayetano told</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us early in the evening that no one on any account should leave the house</p>

  <p class="calibre1">before break of day, and for the necessities of nature he showed us the rudiment-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ary provision that had been made in one corner of the other room. The contempt</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Spaniards for indigenous rites and the Church's condemnation of them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as idolatrous heresies have not killed these assemblies of ancient lineage, but have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">driven them under cover.1 Our hosts were obviously pleased by our intense and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sympathetic interest in all that went on before our eyes. The very fact of our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">participation must have made the evening memorable for them. They were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dressed up for the occasion. Genaro in particular was resplendent in his handsome</p>

  <p class="calibre1">striped sarape and his freshly washed white cotton trousers or bags, which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indian-style were buttonless, being supported by strings tied around the waist.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By our respectful behavior we did all we could to make clear that for us the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rite we were witnessing possessed full religious stature. We were mindful of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drama of our situation. We were attending as participants a mushroomic Supper</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of unique anthropological interest, which was being held pursuant to a tradition</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of unfathomed age, possibly going back to the time when the remote ancestors</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of our hosts were living in Asia, back perhaps to the very dawn of man's cultural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">history, when he was discovering the idea of God.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There were a few home-made wooden chairs in the room, and in the beginning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Allan and RGW used them. Cayetano's brother Genaro and possibly one other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. Dr. Harold Alexander Abramson of New York, a specialist in psychotic research who has studied the action</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of lysergic acid diethylamide and other hallucinogens, believes that persecution was certainly not the only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reason for holding the mushroomic agape behind closed doors. He is sure that the participants, if released from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the centripedal influences of the intimate circle, would sometimes behave in extreme ways, even killing them-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">selves or murdering others or engaging in assaults. When he expressed this view, Dr. Abramson knew nothing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the 16th century accounts of those very excesses perpetrated by persons who, having eaten the mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">went out on the town.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">remained seated on chairs the whole night through. The others lay or reclined</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on mats on the floor, wrapped in <i class="calibre4">sarapes,</i> except of course for the Sefiora and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">her daughter, who, wearing clean <i class="calibre4">huipiles</i> with identical reddish-yellow birds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">embroidered on them in front, sat before the altar-table on mats. They sat with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what seemed a half-studied formality, the daughter a little behind her mother and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">slightly to her mother's right. Later, in the dark, we could barely discern their</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Fig. 21</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">triangular shadows as first one and then the other lifted her voice in song. It was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then, when the details were erased by night and only the geometric mass per-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sisted, that they suddenly reminded RGW of the pyramids that are the outstand-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing feature of architecture in pre-Conquest Mexico. Could the pyramids have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been originally a geometric stylization of the worshipping Indian seated on his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mat, of the gods that were his magnified projection of himself?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At about 10.30 o'clock the Sefiora and her daughter took their positions before</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the small table that served for an altar. On it were two holy pictures, on the left</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the child Jesus and on the right the Baptism in Jordan, with a bouquet in front</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of them, a crucifix hidden in the flowers, three lighted candles of virgin bees-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wax, and a lighted wick in a glass of wax. There were also two pottery bowls</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and some cups. The Senora then went through our box of mushrooms, brush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">291</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_78"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_39">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">ing off with her fingers the grosser pieces of dirt and passing them in her hand</p>

  <p class="calibre1">over copal that was burning on a metal lid on the floor. Into each of the two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bowls she put 13 pair of mushrooms; one bowl was for her and the other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for her daughter. Into each cup she put four pair, or five, or six, and then handed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the cups to the grown-ups that were to take them. The children received none,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and we were told that she never gave mushrooms to children. To RGW she</p>

  <p class="calibre1">handed a cup with six pair. Our readers will imagine his joy at this dramatic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">culmination to years of pursuit. Then she handed a cup with six pair to poor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Allan. Mary, his wife, had reluctantly consented to his coming with us only on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his solemn promise not to let the nasty toadstools cross his lips. He faced a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">behavior dilemma, but to have refused might have disappointed our friendly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indian companions, and so he coped with the immediate problem first and took</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the cup. (Later, with him safely back in New York, Mary gave him ready ab-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">solution.) By now all lights in the room were out except the wick in the glass.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following the Seiiora's example, we began to chew and swallow our mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our <i class="calibre4">curandera</i> ate cap and stem, and we did likewise. She ate them one by one,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with utmost gravity, chewing each one for a long time. She did not pick them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">up by pairs, as Don Aurelio had done in 1953. She picked them up one by one,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">although in apportioning them she had counted them by pairs. The flavor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the mushrooms is acrid and unpleasant. Don Roberto afterwards likened it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to rancid grease, a taste unfamiliar to us. The distinctive flavor would repeat</p>

  <p class="calibre1">itself, as a gaseous beverage does, and pervade the nasal passages. (At the time</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these notes are being written, in September 1955, RGW has eaten five species</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the divinatory mushrooms used in Middle America, and they are all marked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by this singular and unforgettable taste and after-taste, which seem to be the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">veritable signature of the divine species.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We all ate our mushrooms facing the wall where the small altar table stood.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We ate them in silence, except for Cayetano's father, Don Emilio, who was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">consulting the mushrooms about his infected left-forearm. He would jerk his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">head violently with each mushroom that he swallowed, and utter a smacking</p>

  <p class="calibre1">noise, as though in acknowledgement of their divine potency. The Senora had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">asked us to take care not to invade the corner of the room on the left of the altar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">table, for down that corner would descend the Holy Ghost. We sat near-by,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">taking about a half hour to eat our six pair of mushrooms. By 10.40 o'clock</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we had all finished our respective portions, the Sefiora crossing herself with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">last swallow. Then we waited in silence. After about twenty minutes the Senora</p>

  <p class="calibre1">plucked a flower from the bouquet and with it put out the last of the <i class="calibre4">velas.</i> We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">292</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should have been in Stygian darkness, but by good fortune the night was clear</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and a gibbous moon, by the opening above the door, gave us just enough light</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to make our darkness visible.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At about 11.20 o'clock Allan leaned from his chair and whispered to RGW</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that he was having a chill. We wrapped him in a blanket. A little later he leaned</p>

  <p class="calibre1">over again and said, 'Gordon, I am beginning to see things,' to which RGW</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gave him the comforting reply that he was too. Allan lay down along the wall</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the large <i class="calibre4">petate</i> that had been spread for us, and shortly afterwards RGW</p>

  <p class="calibre1">joined him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Except for the children who had eaten no mushrooms, no one slept that night</p>

  <p class="calibre1">until about 4 o'clock in the morning. (The last entry in RGW's notebook carries</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the hour 3.50.) There was no inclination to sleep. At all times we were alert both</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to our subjective hallucinations and to the goings-on around us in the dark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">RGW took imperfect notes intermittently and kept track of the hours. But he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Allan were both alive to the fact that they were not themselves. Though</p>

  <p class="calibre1">RGW had resolved to fight off any effects of the mushrooms and remain the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">detached observer, the mushrooms took full and sweeping possession of him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is no better way to describe the sensation than to say that it was as though</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his very soul had been scooped out of his body and translated to a point floating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in space, leaving behind the husk of clay, his body. 'Landslide', the designation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Mazatecs for the mushroom we were using, had seemed to him a clumsy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name before; now its awesome truth imposed itself. Our bodies lay there while</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our souls soared. We both felt nauseated; RGW twice made his way to the other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room to vomit, and Allan three times. One or two others, not identified in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">darkness, did likewise. But these episodes seemed of no moment. For we were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">both seeing visions, similar but not identical visions, and we were comparing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">notes in whispered interchanges. At first we saw geometric patterns, angular not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">circular, in richest colors, such as might adorn textiles or carpets. Then the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">patterns grew into architectural structures, with colonnades and architraves,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">patios of regal splendor, the stone-work all in brilliant colors, gold and onyx and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ebony, all most harmoniously and ingeniously contrived, in richest magnifi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cence extending beyond the reach of sight, in vistas measureless to man. For some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reason these architectural visions seemed oriental, though at every stage RGW</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pointed out to himself that they could not be identified with any specific oriental</p>

  <p class="calibre1">country. They were neither Japanese nor Chinese nor Indian nor Moslem. They</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seemed to belong rather to the imaginary architecture described by the visionaries</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Bible. In the aesthetics of this discovered world attic simplicity had no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">place: everything was resplendently rich.</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_40">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">At one point in the faint moonlight the bouquet on the table assumed the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dimensions and shape of an imperial conveyance, a triumphal car, drawn by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">living creatures known only to mythology. With our eyes wide open, the visions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">came in endless succession, each growing out of the preceding one. We had the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sensation that the walls of our humble house had vanished, that our untrammeled</p>

  <p class="calibre1">souls were floating in the universe, stroked by divine breezes, possessed of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">divine mobility that would transport us anywhere on the wings of a thought.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now it was clear why Don Aurelio in 1953 and others too had told us that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms would take you <i class="calibre4">ahi donde Dios estd</i> â€” there where God is. Only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when RGW by an act of conscious effort touched the wall of Cayetano's house,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would he be brought back to the confines of the room where we all were,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and this touch with reality seemed to be what precipitated nausea in him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On that night of June 29-30 we saw no human beings in our visions. On the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">night of July 2-3 RGW again took mushrooms in the same room, with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Senora again serving as votary. If we may anticipate our story, on that second</p>

  <p class="calibre1">occasion RGW's visions were different. There were no geometrical patterns,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">no edifices of oriental splendor. The patterns were replaced by artistic motifs of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods in England - armor worn for fashionable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">display, family escutcheons, the carvings of choir stalls and cathedral chairs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">No patina of age hung on them. They were all fresh from God's work-shop,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pristine in their finish. The beholder could only sigh after the skill that would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have fixed those beauteous shapes on paper or in metal or wood, that they might</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not be lost in a vision. They too grew one out of the other, the new one emerging</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the center of its predecessor. Here as in the first night the visions seemed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">freighted with significance. They seemed the very archetypes of beautiful form</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and color. We felt ourselves in the presence of the Ideas that Plato had talked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about. In saying this let not the reader think that we are indulging in rhetoric,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">straining to command his attention by an extravagant figure of speech. For the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world our visions were and must remain 'hallucinations'. But for us they were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not false or shadowy suggestions of real things, figments of an unhinged imagin-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ation. What we were seeing was, we knew, the only reality, of which the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">counterparts of every day are mere imperfect adumbrations. At the time we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ourselves were alive to the novelty of this our discovery, and astonished by it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Whatever their provenience, the blunt and startling fact is that our visions were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sensed more clearly, were superior in all their attributes, were more authoritative,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for us who were experiencing them, than what passes for mundane reality.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Following the visions that we have already described, on both occasions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">RGW saw landscapes. On Wednesday they were of a vast desert seen from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">afar, with lofty mountains beyond, terrace above terrace. Camel caravans were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">advancing across the mountain slopes. On Saturday the landscapes were of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">estuaries of immense rivers brimming over with pellucid water, broad sheets</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of water overflowing into the reeds that stretched equally far from the shore line.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here the colors were in pastel shades. The light was good but soft as from a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">horizontal sun. On both nights the landscapes responded to the command of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beholder: when a detail interested him, the landscape approached with the speed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of light and the detail was made manifest. There seemed to be no birds and no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">human life in the river estuary, until a rude cabin suddenly appeared with a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">woman motionless nearby. She was a woman by her figure and face and costume,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and of course the vision was in color. But she was a statue in that she stood</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there without expression, doing nothing, staring into the distance. She might</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be compared to those archaic Greek sculptures where the woman gazes into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">space, or, better yet, the departing woman on the Greek funerary stele who</p>

  <p class="calibre1">looks into eternity, except that our vision was of a living woman whereas the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greek sculptures, marble white, are mere imitations in stone of what we were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seeing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On both nights RGW stood up for a long time in Cayetano's room, at the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">foot of the stairway, holding on to the rail, transfixed in ecstasy by the visions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that he was seeing in the darkness with his open eyes. For the first time that word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'ecstasy' took on subjective meaning for him. 'Ecstasy' was not someone else's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">state of mind. It was no longer a trite superlative cheapened by overuse. It</p>

  <p class="calibre1">signified something different and superior in kind, about which RGW could</p>

  <p class="calibre1">now testify as a competent witness. There came one moment when it seemed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as though the visions themselves were about to be transcended, and dark gates</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reaching upward beyond sight were about to part, and we were to find our-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">selves in the presence of the Ultimate. We seemed to be flying at the dark gates</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as a swallow at a dazzling lighthouse, and the gates were to part and admit us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But they did not open, and with a thud we fell back, gasping. We felt disap-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pointed, but also frightened and half relieved, that we had not entered into the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">presence of the Ineffable, whence, it seemed to us at the time, we might not have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">returned, for we had sensed that a willing extinction in the divine radiance had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been awaiting us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We know not what manner of visions is induced by opium or hashish or coca</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or mescalin, nor whether the agent in our mushrooms that releases the visions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is related to the agents in them. Later in the Zapotec country, the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aristeo Matias told us that it takes three or four experiences with mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to overcome the initial surprise and the disorder that marks the sequence of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">295</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_82"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_41">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">visions on the first occasions. (Here was fatherly advice from an old hand to us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who had told him that we aspired to enter upon his vocation.) This would suggest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that there is or at least can be a growth, an evolution, in the hallucinatory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">experiences induced by the mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Throughout the night we were strangely split in the very core of our being.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On one level space was annihilated for us and we were traveling as fast as thought</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to our visionary worlds. On another level we were lying there on our <i class="calibre4">petates,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">trying to take notes, RGW and Allan exchanging whispered comments, alive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to every twitch and twinge in our heavy (oh so heavy!) earth-bound bodies of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clay. At the same time we were both held in thrall by what was going on in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room around us. For the Senora and her daughter were engaged all night in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">religious performance that we had not expected and that no one had ever de-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scribed to us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Before we go further we must mention that when we had bespoken the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Senora's services in the afternoon, she had asked us what problem was troubling</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us. Once again RGW trotted out the question of his son Peter, now in the army.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How was he? Alive or dead, or ill, or in good spirits, or in some trouble;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This had seemed to her a sufficient justification. We had counted on Cayetano to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stay with us through the night as our guide and interpreter. We observed that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">neither he nor Guadalupe were taking the mushrooms. As we were finishing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ours, Cayetano informed us that he and his wife were withdrawing up the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stairs and through the trap-door to the room above, where they would guard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us against interruptions from the street. He was leaving his brother Emilio to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">act as our mentor. We sensed that each of the other adults who were taking the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms was consulting them, as we were, about individual problems.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After the Senora had put out the last <i class="calibre4">vela,</i> a silence of perhaps twenty minutes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">followed. The moon was shining brightly outside, and its orbit was such that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shaft of moonlight entering above the door fell squarely on the altar-table, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it did little to relieve the general darkness in the room. Suddenly the Senora began</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to moan, low at first, then louder. There were silent pauses, and then renewed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">humming. Then the humming stopped and she began to articulate isolated syl-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lables, each syllable consisting of a consonant followed by a vowel, sharply pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nounced. The syllables came snapping out in rapid succession, cutting the dark-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ness like a knife, spoken, not shouted. After a time the syllables coalesced into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what we took for words, and the Senora began to chant. The chanting continued</p>

  <p class="calibre1">intermittently all night, first by the Senora and then by her daughter, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">afterwards alternately by one or the other. The chanting was in Mazatec, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there was no one to translate the words for us. Neither Allan nor RGW is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">296</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">instructed musicologically, and we cannot say whether the provenience of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">music was European or indigenous. That the chanting was in Mazatec, and not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Latin or Spanish learned by rote, adds point to this question. (If the chants</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are old, the language may be archaic, which would be a discovery of high interest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the handful of first-rate scholars who have devoted themselves to Mazatec</p>

  <p class="calibre1">linguistics.) Both women chanted in that distinctive way which seems always to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mark the intoning of age-old chants; the singing was soaked in weary melan-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">choly. Our Senora's voice was not loud, probably not loud enough to be heard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the village thoroughfare. But there was a confidence and resonance in her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">primitive utterance that imposed itself. There came a moment late in the night</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when the Sefiora made her way to the door on the terrace and went outside,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">holding her hand on the door. (To this extent she was free of the prohibition</p>

  <p class="calibre1">laid on the rest of us not to leave the house.) When she re-entered, she left the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">door slightly ajar, and we saw her advance <i class="calibre4">on her knees</i> across the open space in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the room, and then turn to the right toward the altar-table. Her hands were up-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lifted to shoulder-level, palms exposed. As she slowly progressed, she sang a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">canticle that seemed like an introit, indescribably tender and plaintive in its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">musical phrases. Her daughter sang well too, but lacked her authority. From</p>

  <p class="calibre1">time to time, as they sang, the men who had taken the mushrooms, notably</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Genaro and young Emilio, ejaculated words, groans, short sentences, and vocal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">noises. We know not "what they said, but they seemed to intervene with their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">voices to suit the singing, in such a way as to produce a strange, barbaric har-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mony.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The singing was not continuous. For stretches the Senora would talk, as though</p>

  <p class="calibre1">invoking the Spirits or as though the Holy Ghost was speaking through the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms. We heard the names of Christ (which she pronounced with an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">intrusive V, <i class="calibre4">Khristros),</i> of St. Peter and St. Paul. We heard her cry out 'Pedro'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">repeatedly in an imploring tone, and knew that the mushrooms were wrestling</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the problem of Peter. Emilio made his way to us and whispered that Peter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was alive and well, and contrite for not having let us hear from him. We asked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for further details, but Emilio said that since we ourselves had eaten the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms, we could expect them to speak to us directly. Our interpreter Emilio</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then vanished into the darkness for the rest of the night.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Unlike the chants, the spoken utterances were fresh and vibrant and rich in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">expressiveness. The mushrooms were talking to the point. We had never sus-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pected how sensitive and poetic an instrument the Mazatec language could be.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The intermittent snatches of the Senora's monologue seemed quick with subtle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">feeling, laden with dramatic import. In our very presence a priestess of the old</p>

  <p class="calibre1">297</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_84"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_42">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">religion was pronouncing oracular dictates in spurts, hot and firm with authority.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How we regretted that we had no means to record her voice! (At the time we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">asked ourselves, and we have repeated the question often since then, whether</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our critical faculties were deranged by the effects of the mushrooms, so that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we over-rated the quality of the Senora's performance. Perhaps so. But if this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is an aberration typical of the syndrome of mushroomic ecstasy, our account</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at least serves to document it for the record, and to establish that our halluci-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nations were auditory as well as visual.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The chanting and the oracular utterances turned out to be only a part of what</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we were to witness. At an early stage we sensed that the Senora was either kneel-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing or standing before the altar-table gesticulating with her arms. We detected</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this by ear and confirmed it uncertainly with the aid of the meager moonlight.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then, much later in the night when her daughter took over the chanting, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Senora made her way to the open space between us and the door, and she em-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">barked on a kind of dance that must have lasted for two hours or more. We do</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not know precisely what she did, because of the darkness, but she was between</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us and the aperture above the door, and we could just make out that she</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was turning clock-wise, facing in succession each of the four compass points,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at the same time raising and lowering her arms. Her daughter was singing, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">she was not silent. She was engaged in a lengthy, rhythmic percussive utterance</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a kind unfamiliar to us. There was a differentiation in the pitch of the beats,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and at times the pattern or phrases seemed to us complex. We cannot say for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sure how she made her sounds, but we are almost sure that she clapped her hands,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">slapped her knees, smacked her forehead, and whammed her chest. We were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">impressed by the cleanness of the utterance. Every clap or slap or smack or wham</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was resonant. Remembering the role played by pitch in the Mazatec language,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we asked ourselves whether the Seiiora was speaking percussively. On each of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our two nights with her, she rinsed her mouth once with water, and the garg-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ling was also rhythmic, and perhaps tonally differentiated. Then she would spit</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out the water on the ground unrhythmically. On Saturday night, in a moment</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of illumination by flashlight, we saw and heard her twicking her long finger</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nails rhythmically. A remarkable feature of her percussive utterance on Wed-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nesday night was its ventriloquistic property. For a long stretch we were in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">blackest darkness while the daughter sang and the Senora was performing her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strange dance with percussive accompaniment. As she would snap out her re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sonant claps and smacks, we seemed to catch them out of the night from various</p>

  <p class="calibre1">directions. Let the reader remember that all the while we were seeing our visions</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">and</i> attending to the auditory sensations served to us by the two women. There</p>

  <p class="calibre1">298</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we were, visually suspended in space before the vast panorama of, say, the Gobi</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Desert, with a singing accompaniment and with percussive cracks assailing us,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">now from above, now here, now there, exactly like Hamlet's ghost <i class="calibre4">hie et</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ubique,</i> hitting us with a cutting crispness from unpredictable quarters, as though</p>

  <p class="calibre1">an air-borne choir of invisible creatures was peopling the dark void around</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us, perplexing us with their assorted and shifting cries. Possibly this ventri-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">loquistic effect was caused by the Senora's turning in different directions as she</p>

  <p class="calibre1">performed, so that the sound caromed to us from the ceiling or walls. And all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the while there was the irregular chorus, subdued in volume, of ecstatic ex-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clamations from the Indians reclining on the ground. Confined though we were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in a room without windows or open door, at one point we felt a swish of air,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">just as though we were really suspended in the great outdoors. Was this too an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hallucination? If so, all shared it, for when the wind blew on us, there was general</p>

  <p class="calibre1">excitement, flashlights were switched on, and our Indian friends were sitting up,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amazed at being stroked by the Divine Afflatus.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At one point in the night RGW made a discovery. In the light of a cigarette</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that someone was inhaling, he saw the Seiiora, who was performing her dance,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lift a small bottle to her lips. From her posture the bottle seemed almost empty.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A few minutes later she began to thump the butt end of the bottle on the <i class="calibre4">petate.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">She did this with a fast, uniform, perfect beat, perhaps a hundred to the minute,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and she kept at it for an eternity, minutes on end, until Allan and RGW could</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hardly stand it any longer and groaned in agony. The iterated thump, somewhat</p>

  <p class="calibre1">resonant, became excruciatingly painful, a torture such as Poe might have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">described. After the night had passed and we were all getting up, RGW made</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a point to find the bottle and smell it. There could be no doubt: it was the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">familiar six-ounce bottle of <i class="calibre4">aguardiente,</i> a distillate of cane. Presumably the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sefiora had shared it with her daughter, but of this we are not sure. We asked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cayetano about it. Yes, invariably the person who retains the Seiiora is expected</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to present her in advance with a <i class="calibre4">cuarto</i> (fourth of a litre) of this strong drink. We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in our ignorance had neglected our duty, but Cayetano had come to our rescue.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Recalling as we did how Don Aurelio and our friends in the Mije country had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all said that alcohol was tabu before, during, and after the consumption of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, we are still at a loss how to reconcile the conflicting evidence.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But of course the Senora's performance from first to last had differed from what</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Aurelio had shown us in 1953. We had now attended two all-night vigils,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">both using the sacred mushrooms, but otherwise utterly different from each</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other. Don Aurelio's divinatory liturgy, with the elaborate role in it of ac-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cessories, could conceivably go on without mushrooms, but in Cayetano's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">299</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_86"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_43">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">house the mushrooms were the key to everything. We spoke to Cayetano about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that other performance that we had seen in the Mazatec country in 1953. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">knew all about that kind too, and he told us that the Senora was equally pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ficient in both ceremonies. We failed to learn, however, when one method is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">used in preference to the other.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At intervals throughout the night, perhaps every forty minutes or so, there</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would be what we can only describe as intermissions. After working up to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">powerful climax in utterance, the Senora and her daughter would subside into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">silence. We recall one such climax when the Senora, half-singing, half declaim-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing, spat forth in endless repetition and with barbaric violence the two syllables</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">chung-ha</i> (the first element riming, not with 'sung', but with the Chinese 'Sung');</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we were never able to learn what this meant. After such climaxes our two vo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">taries and our reclining Indian friends would light cigarettes (ordinary ones) and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">smoke and engage in the most animated conversation. Clearly they were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discussing what was happening, but we had no interpreter. They would light</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the electric torches. We took advantage of these moments to study the Senora.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She was not in a trance. That is to say, she was one of us, talking and smoking.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But she was in a state of excitement, her eyes flashing, her smile no longer that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grave smile which we had observed before, but now quick with animation and,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">if we may use the word, <i class="calibre4">carltas.</i> For there is another aspect to the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that we must mention. The spirit of an agape of which we have already spoken</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was a prelude to a wave of generous or tender feelings that the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">aroused in everyone. To illustrate this, we recall how, when nausea first sent one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of us into the adjoining room to vomit, the Senora, who had been in full song,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">immediately stopped the performance, and she and the others manifested the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">most embarrassing solicitude about the unhappy episode, which after all was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wholly unimportant. On the two nights that we passed in Cayetano's house, we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were aware of no erotic stimulation among those present and we think there</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was none. But the feeling of brotherly affection was strong indeed. Twice in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">course of that first night the Senora reached out her right hand to RGW and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sought contact with his fingers in friendly greeting, across the chasm of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">language barrier. The Indians of Middle America are known for their reticence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the display of affection, even within the family circle. It was now clear that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mushrooms emancipate them from inhibitions of this kind, and what we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">witnessed on Wednesday night was abundantly confirmed during our second</p>

  <p class="calibre1">session on Saturday, July 2.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After the first performance Allan and RGW, quite stunned and even numbed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by what we had witnessed, were disposed to say, 'Never again'. But by Saturday</p>

  <p class="calibre1">300</p>

  <p class="calibre1">PLATE L. Maria Sabina, curandera, and her son Aurelio under the influence of mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Huautla de Jimenez, June 29, 1955.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">morning there were many questions that we needed to clarify, and so through</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cayetano we asked the Sefiora if she would give us a repetition. This she agreed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to do. We pled with her to let us take a few photographs by flashlight while the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">power was on her. She said yes, and in the course of that night from Saturday</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to Sunday Allan took perhaps twenty pictures in the darkness, guessing of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">necessity as to the distance and direction. (It was raining in torrents all that night,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and so there was no moon.) But the Senora's behavior differed much from what</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we had seen the first time. Everything was reduced in scale. There was no danc-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing and virtually no percussive utterance. Only three or four other Indians were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with us, and the Sefiora brought with her, not her daughter, but her son Aurelio,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a youth in his late teens who seemed to us in some way ill or defective. He and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not we were the object of her attention. All night long her singing and her words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were directed to this boy. Her performance was the dramatic expression of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mother's love for her child, a lyric to mother-love, and interpreted in this way</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it was profoundly moving. The tenderness in her voice as she sang and spoke, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in her gestures as she leaned over Aurelio to caress him, moved us profoundly.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As strangers we should have been embarrassed, had we not seen in this <i class="calibre4">curandera</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">possessed of the mushrooms a symbol of eternal motherhood, rather than the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">anguished cry of an individual parent. But by any interpretation this untram-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meled and beautiful outpouring, touched off in all likelihood by the sacred</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, was behavior of a kind that few Middle American anthropologists</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would ever expect to see.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On this second occasion Allan took no mushrooms, for the sake of his photo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">graphy. The Sefiora asked RGW how many pair he would take, which he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">interpreted as a compliment to his status as one already initiated, and he said</p>

  <p class="calibre1">five. The effect seemed as strong as he had experienced from the larger dose on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wednesday, but this time there was no nausea.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Both of our nights with the Sefiora drew to a close in the same way. On the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">night of Wednesday-Thursday, our last notes seem to have been scribbled a few</p>

  <p class="calibre1">minutes before 4 a.m., and soon afterwards we slipped off imperceptibly into a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dreamless slumber. Apparently everyone else did likewise. At any rate, at about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">6 o'clock we woke up, our heads clear. Some of the others were already stirring,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in a few minutes everyone was on his feet. RGW changed the roll in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">camera and resumed picture-taking, as did Allan. Cayetano and Guadalupe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">asked after our welfare but were discreet in their inquiries about the night's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">doings. They served us coffee and bread. By 7 o'clock we were ready to sally</p>

  <p class="calibre1">forth into the world. We felt no untoward sleepiness that day.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps in some respects we can define better than we have done the psychic</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_44">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">disturbance caused by the sacred mushrooms. On the one hand, they unhinge</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one's sense of time. Visions that seem to last an aeon run their course in a minute</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or so. Only by reference to a time-piece does one keep track of the passing hours.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the other hand, the faculty of memory is heightened by the mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">All the impressions, visual and auditory, are graved as with a burin in the tablet</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the memory. Our narrative of what took place has been checked with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">notes that we jotted down at the time, but our memory is far richer and fuller</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than those notes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">What can we say about the source of our visions ; Did they bubble up out of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our own past ; We have no conscious memory of having viewed previously the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scenes that we saw. There was nothing in them that repeated themes familiar to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us in our adult experience, no modern highways, cars, cities. Yet all that we saw</p>

  <p class="calibre1">could be related to themes latent in our imagination, not necessarily things seen,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nor even things seen in graphic representation, but those things transmuted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">afterwards in the imagination, imagined from reading, seen in the mind's eye.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">All of the visions had that pristine quality which we associate most often with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the magic of supreme literary expression, especially great poetry. In the lives of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us all, even those who are most earth-bound, there are moments when things,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">even the most humdrum, suddenly and unaccountably clothe themselves with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beauty, haunting and ravishing beauty. It now seems to us that all such flashes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must emerge from the subconscious well where our visions have all this time</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been stored, for the mushroomic visions are an endless sequence of those flashes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There are those like Keats who have possessed the power to see such visions in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">abundance without the mushroomic stimulus. Could the mushrooms have done</p>

  <p class="calibre1">better by Keats than he did without them; What would they have shown him</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that he did not see; What precisely do our Indian friends see, with their dif-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ferent background; Clearly the visions come from within the beholder, either</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from his own unconscious or, as some will surely think, from an inherited fund</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of memories of the race. What an amazing thing that we should all be carrying</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this inventory of wonders around with us, ready to be tripped into our conscious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world by mushrooms! Are the Indians far wrong in calling these divine; We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suspect that, in its fullest sense, the creative faculty, whether in the humanities or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">science or industry, that most precious of man's distinctive possessions and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one most clearly partaking of the divine, is linked in some way with the area of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mind that the mushrooms unlock.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We believe that the mushrooms are not habit forming. If we are right, they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">differ in this respect, not only from alcohol, but from the drugs such as opium</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and marihuana that are reputed to stimulate beatific visions. In the course of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">302</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our three expeditions to Mexico, covering four cultural areas, we never heard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a mushroom addict. We believe that use of the mushrooms does not affect the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">threshold of tolerance for them; that is to say, one does not raise the dose on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">successive occasions to obtain the same effect, either for the short run as when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we used them twice in four days, or over the long term. Our Sefiora and her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">daughter took more than twice the dose of the others, but this quota goes with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their vocation. Everyone's dose seems to remain constant throughout life,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">though the dose varies somewhat from person to person. We have seen no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence that the mushrooms can cause harmful psychic effects but our ex-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perience is too limited for us to generalise about this. Are persons with neurotic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or psychotic inclinations endangered by the mushrooms? After a life-time of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use do mushroom-eating <i class="calibre4">curanderos</i> show mental deterioration; May there be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">individuals whose mushroomic visions are horrifying and who are stimulated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to violence by them; We do not know. In considering the clinical effects of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mushrooms, let us not overlook the extraordinary performance of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sefiora and her daughter. They had each eaten more than twice as many pair of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms as the rest of us, and they not only kept hold of themselves: they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">staged a liturgy that called for disciplined virtuosity of a high order.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Friday, July i, VPW and Masha joined us in our village. We had all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">planned to leave immediately after the Saturday night experience, but the rains</p>

  <p class="calibre1">came and we found ourselves marooned among our Mazatec friends for most</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the following week. On Tuesday the 5th VPW and Masha, having nothing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">else to do, took the mushrooms in the afternoon, VPW five pair and Masha four,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and then they lay down in their sleeping bags. This was the first occasion on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which white people ate the mushrooms for purely experimental purposes,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">without the aura of a native ceremony. They too saw their visions, for hours</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on end, all pleasant, mostly of a nostalgic kind. They felt little or no nausea.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Their pupils dilated and failed to respond to our flashlights. The pulse showed a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tendency to slow down. There were no auditory hallucinations. But six weeks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">later, when RGW in New York took the mushrooms for the third time on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">August 12, his visions were accompanied by an insistent beat with variation of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pitch, perhaps an evocation of the Senora's percussive performance. The beat was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not unpleasant. It seemed freighted with meaning, as though it was the rhyth-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mic pulse of the universe. When the Sefiora had performed for us, we had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">passed most of the night in virtual darkness - an environment adapted to dilated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eyes. Our experience in New York took place in a room illuminated by lights</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the street, and moreover on that night of the I2th a hurricane known at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the time as Connie was brushing by the city. We found that the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">303</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_90"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_45">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">had retained their full potency in a dried state, if indeed their power had not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">increased. We made another discovery. As we stood at the window and watched</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the gale tossing the trees and the water of the East River, with the rain driven</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in squalls before the wind, the whole scene was further quickened to life by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the abnormal intensity of the colors that we saw. We had always thought that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">El Greco's apocalyptic skies over Toledo were a figment of the poet's imagin-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ation. But on this night we saw El Greco's skies, nothing dimmed, whirling</p>

  <p class="calibre1">over New York.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now we come to the end of our Mazatec experience. We had agreed from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the beginning to pay the Senora her usual fee for her services. We paid her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fifty pesos for each night, which was somewhat more than she expected. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dollars this meant $ 4.00 a night, but in her world the fee meant much more,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perhaps subjectively as much as $ 50.00 in New York. Before we left the village</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we asked Cayetano what we could pay him for his contribution to the success</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of our visit. He turned to his wife and let her speak. <i class="calibre4">'No hicimos esto par dinero ,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">she said, which is to say, 'We did not do this for money', and they would accept</p>

  <p class="calibre1">none. We were especially grateful to the Senora for having allowed us to take</p>

  <p class="calibre1">photographs while the power of the mushrooms was on her, during that second</p>

  <p class="calibre1">night. It had not been easy for her to consent to the rude interruption of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">flashlight, and we ourselves knew also that the pictures would be misleading,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as they would convey no idea of the darkness that Allan and ROW will always</p>

  <p class="calibre1">associate with the mushroomic agape. We noticed at the time that the flash-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lights upset the pace of her performance, interrupted the spontaneity of her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">singing. On the morning after, a messenger came to us from her. We were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">welcome to the pictures, she said, but would we please refrain from showing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">those particular ones to any except our most trusted friends, for if we showed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them to all and sundry, <i class="calibre4">sena una traidon,</i> it would be a betrayal. We are doing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the Senora asked us, showing these photographs only in those circles where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we feel sure she would be pleased to have them shown. In order that she be not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">disturbed by the importunities of commercially-minded strangers, we have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">withheld the name of the village where she lives, and we have changed the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">names of the characters in our narrative. On our next visit we shall ask for per-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mission to publish our pictures for general circulation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Friday evening, July 8, we all arrived back in our home in San Angel,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and after a good night's sleep we were ready on the following day to pursue</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our quest for the divine mushrooms in new directions. RGW had received a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">letter in May from Mrs. Carmen Cook de Leonard of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">304</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mexico City, the well known student of indigenous cultures, with surprising</p>

  <p class="calibre1">information. It seemed that she and her colleague, Miss Bodil Christensen, had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discovered that the use of the divine mushrooms still survived in a village not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">far from the capital city. They would be glad to place their information at our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">disposal, and to try to arrange for a <i class="calibre4">curandera</i> to consult the mushrooms on our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">behalf. After our arrival in Mexico and while we were in the Mazatec country,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mrs. Cook de Leonard and Miss Christensen talked with their <i class="calibre4">curandera</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">she agreed to serve us on the evening of Saturday, July 9.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On that Saturday afternoon we drove out to the town of Amecameca some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">forty miles away, and thence by a dirt road three miles to the bleak forbidding</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indian village of San Pedro Nexapa. (The <i class="calibre4">-x-</i> in this name has the sound of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spanish -/'-.) We were now on the slopes of the volcano Popocatepetl, at about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">8,000 feet altitude, above the Valley of Mexico. This was Aztec country, where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">even now the old people still can speak classic Nahuatl. We sought out the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">humble house where the <i class="calibre4">curandera</i> Marina Rosas lives, a flimsy wooden structure</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that freely admitted the cold, dank breezes. We found the aged lady seated on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a <i class="calibre4">petate</i> and wrapped tight in her shawl near the wood fire on the floor. Though</p>

  <p class="calibre1">she must have known Nahuatl, Spanish was clearly her language of preference.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She informed us that she was ill and therefore could not help us. She was sorry,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but what could she do? She was ready to appoint another day, and we settled</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on Saturday, July 30. If we may anticipate the later events, we returned three</p>

  <p class="calibre1">weeks later, on that appointed day, only to discover that Marina Rosas, seated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the same <i class="calibre4">petate</i> in the same place, was again unable to help us, not because</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of illness this time but because, doubtful whether we were really going to arrive,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">she had broken her fast and eaten a midday meal. <i class="calibre4">Para aue contesten ellos, ha de</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ser limpio el estomago -</i> for the mushrooms to reply, the stomach must be clean.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The old lady was lovable in her excuses and protestations, but RGW felt that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">she really did not wish to eat the mushrooms for us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But our visits to San Pedro Nexapa were not fruitless. We learned from Ma-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rina that only one kind of divinatory mushroom is known in the village and we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">obtained a small packet of dried specimens. As in the Mije and Mazatec re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gions, one considers that the mushrooms speak, not the person who eats them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The mushrooms are gathered in September, around the time of the Cholula</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fair, above the village on the slopes of the volcano, perhaps as high as 10,000</p>

  <p class="calibre1">feet. In the Mije and Mazatec regions we had learned that in the hot low country</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mushrooms are not used. Now we discovered that the higher limits are high</p>

  <p class="calibre1">indeed. They are eaten only in a dried condition and they keep for a year, until</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the next ones are gathered. According to Marina, the whole mushroom is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">305</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_92"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_46">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">eaten, pileus and stipe. Marina never used the word <i class="calibre4">curandero.</i> He who knows</p>

  <p class="calibre1">how to use the mushrooms is a <i class="calibre4">trabajador del cielo,</i> a heavenly worker. Sometimes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4">trabajador</i> gives them to the sick person to eat, but the mushrooms will not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speak through the sick person because he is not chosen. We discovered from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Marina that she customarily takes six pair, but with the six pair she also takes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">twelve seeds possessed of parallel psychic powers. These seeds are called in Na-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">huatl 'bird's-eyes' and in the Spanish of Mexico <i class="calibre4">colorines.</i> To botanists they are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the seeds of the rhynchosia pyramidalis (Lam.) Urban, also known as the rhyn-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chosia phaseoloides (Sw.) DC. They are bright red with a large black spot, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">size of a bird's eyes. The black spot does not cover the hilum or eye of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seed, and this is precisely what distinguishes the seeds used by Marina from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">poisonous seeds of the abrus precatorium L., which superficially look alike but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whose hilum is black. Marina spoke of the divinatory mushrooms as <i class="calibre4">los ninos,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">'the children'. The significance of this name becomes apparent only when we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">learn that the Nahuatl term in Marina's village is <i class="calibre4">apipiltzin,</i> wherein <i class="calibre4">-tzin</i> is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the diminutive suffix, <i class="calibre4">-pipil-</i> means 'children', and <i class="calibre4">a-</i> stand for <i class="calibre4">atl,</i> 'water'. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this village high in the mountains where classical Nahuatl is spoken, our mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms are the 'little children of the waters'. There will be occasion elsewhere</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to revert to this name. Marina told us that the mushrooms 'speak' only in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nahuatl. If she is right, the divinatory mushrooms would seem to be linked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">irrevocably with the fate of the old language, and doomed to disappear when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the old generation fades out.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For some years Robert Weitlaner had been hearing rumors, which he con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">veyed to us, that the mushrooms were still being used in the Valley of Toluca</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about two hours by car from Mexico City, where the altitude is also around</p>

  <p class="calibre1">8,000 feet. During our stay in Mexico Donald Leonard, the husband of Carmen</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cook, made two trips thither for us, accompanied on one occasion by Don</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Roberto. They went first to Tenango del Valle, the very town mentioned by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jacinto de la Serna in his account of mushroomic idolatries in the iyth century.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the market place of that town they learned from an old woman that two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kinds of divinatory mushrooms are still being used thereabouts, the larger known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as <i class="calibre4">mujerdtas</i> and the smaller as <i class="calibre4">hombredtos,</i> the little women and little men.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Collectively they are called <i class="calibre4">ninos</i> or <i class="calibre4">nandcatl.</i> These mushrooms are not exposed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the market place but are obtainable there. The supply comes from a village</p>

  <p class="calibre1">called San Pedro Tlanixco, only a few miles away, where it seems that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">people make a specialty of gathering and preparing these 'children of the waters'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mr. Leonard brought back specimens of both kinds.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thus thanks to the diligence of the Leonards and Miss Christensen we have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discovered the mushroom cult surviving to this day in the very land of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nahua. Whereas forty years ago W. E. Safford was denying that any such cult</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had ever existed, we now find it on the door-step of the capital city of Mexico.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Valley of Toluca the Aztecs overran and superseded the earlier Matlat-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">zinca population, of whom there still exists one village speaking the old tongue,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the region where the people speak Mazahua is hard by. We know from our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">early quotations that both these peoples knew the mushroom. Where is the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">anthropologist who will do the study that cries for doing in the Valley of Toluca</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and thereabouts ? He might well start in San Pedro Tlanixco. Here apparently</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he would confront a most curious problem in economics, a village that specializes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in supplying consumers with a sacred product that never enters the ordinary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">channels of trade. The student should try to discover the circumstances surround-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing the mushroom harvest, attend the drying of them, learn where and how they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are stored, and as best he can trace them to the ultimate consumers, recording</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for us all the associations, religious, social, folkloric, and linguistic, that accom-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pany them on their way. Here is a study in little things pregnant with cultural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning. Who knows &gt; Perhaps he would discover that some of the product</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reaches Mexico City itself, and that heavenly workers in its very precincts are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">still consulting the little children of the waters.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In 1949 Dr. Pedro Carrasco, the gifted Mexican anthropologist, visited a num-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ber of villages in the coastal sierra of southern Oaxaca, a region almost unknown</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to travelers. He gave his account of this trip in the paper that he contributed to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Festschrift honoring Dr. Alfonso Caso, which appeared in 1951, and in it he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dropped the remark that the villagers were still using the sacred mushrooms, as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">well as other hallucinogens. One of the goals of our 1955 trip was to repeat Dr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Carrasco's visit and amplify his observation. For our guide we engaged once</p>

  <p class="calibre1">again our friend from the Mije trip, Francisco Ortega, known as Chico, who at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our behest made a quick trip to the area early in June to learn whether it was at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all accessible in the rainy season. He reported that the trip was feasible, but that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the villagers were suspicious of strangers and inhospitable, and that we should</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not think of going unless we carried letters of commendation to the local authori-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ties from the Governor of the State and the Commanding General of the Mili-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tary Zone.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Equipped with these credentials, we set out from the city of Oaxaca on Friday</p>

  <p class="calibre1">morning, July 15. Our party, in addition to Chico, consisted of our old friend</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and mentor Robert J. Weitlaner, Professor Howard E. Brunson of the East</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Los Angeles Junior College, and RGW. In the afternoon of the following day</p>

  <p class="calibre1">307</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_94"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_47">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">we reached the town of San Agustin Loxicha,1 a cluster of houses on a mountain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ridge, some 1,700 meters high, that looks south across rugged and verdant terrain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the Pacific Ocean some ten or fifteen miles away. The town is almost due</p>

  <p class="calibre1">south from Oaxaca and about 100 miles by road and trail. In the rainy season the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mornings are usually bright and clear, so clear that the breaking surf can be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">descried in the distance. But soon the clouds roll in from the sea and the rain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is likely to come down in torrents for hours on end. The town is idyllic in its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">loveliness, almost all of its houses of adobe with roofs either of thatch or home-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">made shingles beautifully weathered, everything washed clean by the rain, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">air pellucid in the morning sun, the whole sparkling community perched as it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were in an upper balcony of a vast amphitheater of mountains overlooking</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the distant Pacific sea. We arrived at the moment when the <i class="calibre4">floripundio</i> was in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bloom, a tree arrayed in trumpet-like blooms, dazzling white, that greets the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eyes at every turn. This is the angels' trumpet of Florida, the datura suavaeolens</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of botanists.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The people of this area are Zapotecs, speaking one of the several Zapotec</p>

  <p class="calibre1">languages. But these languages differ much from each other, and Chico, versed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the tongues of the Isthmus and the Valley, could not cope with the speech of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">San Agustin. There was an element in the village who were hostile to us from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the beginning, just as Chico had warned us to expect, and we were glad for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the measure of protection that our letters gave us. The hostility grew as the days</p>

  <p class="calibre1">passed, but the concern that we felt at times for our safety is, in retrospect, merely</p>

  <p class="calibre1">an incidental phase of travel such as this, and we shall not dwell on the details</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beyond saying that we were all relieved when we had left the town behind us on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Saturday morning, July 23, after we had stayed there one week. All the experi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ence and tact of Don Roberto and Chico had been needed to keep the hostility</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in bounds.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In June Chico had made contact with a leading villager of San Agustin,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ismael Jimenez Reyes, a store-keeper and coffee grower, who had promised</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chico the cooperation of a <i class="calibre4">compadre</i> of his, a <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> of the first rank, Aristeo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Matias by name. We called on Ismael at once. In fluent Spanish he told us that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he himself never has recourse to the mushrooms, but he knew much about them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by hearsay and he told us all he knew. What he said echoed many things that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we had heard in the Mije and Mazatec country, in Miss Pike's letter, and in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">old books. Like our Mije friends, he said that if a dog barks or if a cock crows</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. This is one of nine towns or settlements in the region to the names of which 'Loxicha' is added, the others</p>

  <p class="calibre1">being Santa Catarina, San Bartolo, Magdalena, San Francisco, Buena Vista, Candelaria, Santa Marta, and San</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Baltasar. Scholars seem not to have arrived at the meaning of'Loxicha', in which the 'x' has the phonetic value</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of V.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre5">308</b></p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nearby, nothing can be expected from a mushroom vigil thus interrupted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Reminding us of the i6th century botanist Francisco Hernandez, he said that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one kind of mushroom makes the eater give himself over to sheer laughter,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pura risa.</i> (Later Don Aristeo corrected this. There is no such species, he ex-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">plained, but any of the divinatory mushrooms can provoke this effect when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">taken by weaklings or cowards.) Ismael told us a story that reminded us of an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">episode in Miss Pike's letter. On his farm Ismael had once had a hired hand, a</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">mozo,</i> who fell ill. " 'They will never cure me with medicine,' the <i class="calibre4">mozo</i> said;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'I am going to take me a mushroom.' And so he did. Then he said, 'Give up</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hope. I am going to die.' Still possessed by the mushroom, he added, 'I no longer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">live'. 'They have already come, and taken hold of me, and are carrying me</p>

  <p class="calibre1">away.' Shortly afterwards he really died. Yes, with the mushrooms he saw how</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his soul was already being torn from his body. His soul was already in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other world."1 This episode, told to us with moving simplicity by Ismael,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">serves to illustrate a fact about the use of divinatory mushrooms in Middle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">America that all our evidence supports. The mushrooms play a major role in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the folk medicine of the various archaic cultures where they are used, but in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">native thinking never as therapeutic agents. The Indians use them for diagnosis</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and prognosis. The mushrooms are expected to reveal the cause, nature, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">course of the illness, and if the outlook is not hopeless, to declare what must be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">done for the patient to recover. Under the spell of the mushrooms, the <i class="calibre4">mozo</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the story saw himself die, and he accepted the death verdict. (Of course by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">modern medical criteria the mushrooms produce a powerful psycho-catharsis</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with somatic consequences.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aristeo Matias the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> was working his acres when we arrived in San</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Agustin. Ismael sent his son-in-law Pedro Garcia to fetch him, first to a <i class="calibre4">rancho</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">three hours below, and then, not finding him there, to another <i class="calibre4">rancho</i> high in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mountains in a different direction and also far away. At last he found Don</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aristeo and they arrived back in San Agustin on Sunday evening, joining us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where we were all huddled together in Ismael's little store. Don Aristeo presented</p>

  <p class="calibre1">an extraordinary appearance, a little man, clearly weighing less than a hundred</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pounds, in his fifties, with an expressive little face and almost no teeth. He had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">no Spanish whatever, and during the long hours that we were to pass with him</p>

  <p class="calibre1">during the following week, we had as our interpreters Ismael, Pedro, and his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">own son Serafin. Don Aristeo was an informant of value in the sense that he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. In Ismael's words: Tuve una vez un mozo en la rancheria, y se enfermo. 'No me curan con la medicina,'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">me dijo. 'Me voy a tomar un hongo.' Tomo. Entonces me dijo, 'Pierda la esperanza. Yo me voy a morir.'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Y murio. Antes de morir dijo, 'Yo ya no vivo,' y despues, 'Ya vinieron y me agarraron y me llevaron.' Le ha-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bian ya sacado el alma. El alma ya estaba en el otro mundo.</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_48">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">was a product of his world little touched by outside influences, but his responses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were slow, it was difficult for him to grasp the import of our questions, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">patience was often needed to arrive at his meaning.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We told Don Aristeo that we had come from far away to learn the secrets</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the sacred mushrooms with the idea that we might take up his vocation, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we asked him also for news about the fate of RGW's son Peter. All this seemed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reasonable to him, but the Zapotecs are a race notorious for their hypertrophied</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pocket nerve, and the next day, before we got down to work, Don Aristeo sent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us word by Ismael that he would help us for 1,000 pesos. There were further</p>

  <p class="calibre1">interchanges through our intermediaries Ismael and Cliico, and we finally settled</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on 500 pesos, or about $40 U.S. How different from the nobility of Cayetano</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Guadalupe in the Mazatec country! But when we had once agreed on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">price, Don Aristeo kept his bargain, and some days later, on the eve of our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">departure, we kept ours, paying him off, and our interpreters too, with solemn</p>

  <p class="calibre1">formality, by the light of a candle, in Ismael's store.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> in San Agustin is called <i class="calibre4">menjak,1</i> 'he who knows', exactly the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same figure of speech that we had found in the Mazatec country. The designation</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">menjak</i> retains its literal sense, so that instead of <i class="calibre4">menjak,</i> in the appropriate con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">text one uses <i class="calibre4">sanjak,</i> 'that man knows'. In speaking Spanish Ismael rendered the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Zapotec words by <i class="calibre4">sabio,</i> the wiseman, rather than by <i class="calibre4">curandero.</i> Don Aristeo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">told us that his father had given him the mushrooms for the first time at the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">age of 12. His father had been a <i class="calibre4">menjak,</i> and his father's father before him. But</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his son Serafin showed little promise; alcohol was his undoing. Women are just</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as good as men in this vocation, perhaps better, he said, for they are not given</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to alcohol; and he cited one Ebrigida Santiago, in the village, to illustrate his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">point. The woman who pursues this calling is a <i class="calibre4">ngol'njak.</i> Don Aristeo said that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the beginner must take the mushrooms several times before he can cope with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them as a <i class="calibre4">menjak.</i> 'On taking the mushroom for the first time, the mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">introduces himself to the novice, <i class="calibre4">Asi me llamo yo</i> ['thus am I called'; note the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">parallel with Exodus 3 :i4]. Then terrible things happen, but one must not be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">afraid. You rush to the sea, you plunge in, you go up to heaven, there where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jesus Christ is, and then to hell where the criminals are. You see the whole world</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lying in the middle of the sea. On the second try you are thrown into the sea, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be not afraid. Then you see two women and two men who are gathering up</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the blood where Christ was born [sic]. On the third try everything changes, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">now you are strong and the voices begin to come. Then on the fourth try you</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. In Zapotec there are three tones: high indicated by', low by', middle by no accent. In our spelhng, 'j' is as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in 'judge'. A synonym for <i class="calibre4">menjak</i> is <i class="calibre4">ngwe'dz,</i> the apostrophe here as elsewhere representing a glottal stop.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3 1 0</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">arrive there where the Virgin Mary is, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and then they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">explain good things. Then all the Spirits come, all the Virgins, all the Saints.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then you know, and you are <i class="calibre4">menjak?</i> From that moment the mushroom teaches</p>

  <p class="calibre1">you all things.'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Aristeo told us that all the <i class="calibre4">curanderos</i> of the region are known to each</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other, and that there are three elders among them, of whom he is one. The three</p>

  <p class="calibre1">take counsel together from time to time, when questions come up, and in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">difficult cases one of them calls in another, who takes the mushrooms and wrestles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the problem. For four days before taking the mushrooms the <i class="calibre4">menjak</i> must</p>

  <p class="calibre1">refrain from alcohol, even beer, and also from sexual relations. But you may eat</p>

  <p class="calibre1">any food and smoke tobacco. The four day period is called a <i class="calibre4">noven,</i> adapted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the Spanish <i class="calibre4">novena,</i> and you count back from the end of the mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">session. Thus if the session ends at dawn on Friday, then Friday, Thursday,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wednesday, and Tuesday are the four days, and you begin to observe the re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gime from Tuesday noon on.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The word for 'mushroom' in the Zapotec of San Agustin is <i class="calibre4">mbey,</i> and this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">appears to be the basic word in all the Zapotec languages. There is no other word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to designate the sacred mushrooms, but this function is served in some measure</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by <i class="calibre4">mbeydo',</i> an important and curious term that is a 'collective': it means a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">batch or lot or mess of sacred mushrooms. It is never used for mushrooms other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than the sacred ones. The cap or pileus of the mushroom is the <i class="calibre4">yek,</i> 'head',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same figure that we have found in the Mije and Mazatec country. The stipe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is the 'leg' and the gills are the 'inside' of the mushroom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Aristeo uses four kinds of mushrooms for divinatory purposes. First,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there is the <i class="calibre4">piule de churls,</i> wherein <i class="calibre4">churls</i> means 'the small ones'. <i class="calibre4">Piule</i> is a word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">widely used in Mexico in the vocabulary for the hallucinogens, but its etymo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logy, range, and application seem not to have been a subject of study. In this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">case the <i class="calibre4">piule de churls</i> is a mushroom that grows in pastures and cultivated fields.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Aristeo gave us samples. (Query: Is <i class="calibre4">piule</i> derived from <i class="calibre4">peyotb.}</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The second and third kinds are both called <i class="calibre4">piule de barda,</i> wherein <i class="calibre4">barda,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">'thorn', stands for Christ's crown of thorns. One of these species grows in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clumps near but not in marshy ground, and it is black, and it stains the ground</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and plants nearby with its own blackness. It appears to be abundant, and Don</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aristeo had a large supply which he had gathered lately and dried in the sun.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The other kind is much larger, rising to six or seven inches in height. It grows in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the shallow water of marshy land, singly, and it is much harder to gather in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quantity. The upper surface of the cap is bright yellow, but the gills and stipe are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dark. To distinguish this from the first, it is called in Spanish the <i class="calibre4">grandote,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">311</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_98"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_49">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">'big fellow'. It is said to appear on the day of St. Anthony, June 13. In the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Zapotec country the marshy places are considered holy, and these two kinds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of mushrooms are linked with the holy marsh land. They told us that beneath</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the marsh a great <i class="calibre4">culebra</i> or serpent <i class="calibre4">(mjd'mdo'</i> in Zapotec) lives. I asked what it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">looked like, and they said no one had ever seen it. Thus the belief in the Middle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">American serpent deities lives on to this day.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The fourth kind of divinatory mushroom, of which we saw no specimens,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is the <i class="calibre4">ndotan de venado,</i> the Lord of the Deer. While all four kinds can be used in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">substitution for each other for all purposes, this one is especially good for help</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in hunting, because you see in your visions where all the animals are, in a great</p>

  <p class="calibre1">corral, shepherded by the <i class="calibre4">Dueno de Todos los Animales,</i> Lord of all Animals,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">another survivor of the pre-Columbian divinities of Middle America. Accord-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing to Don Aristeo, this mushroom is some five inches across, and yellow above</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and below, growing in dry earth near any ditch, along any roadside, especially</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in low country.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Aristeo said that the mushrooms were just as potent when dried as fresh</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and that they keep for months. When there are no mushrooms, the <i class="calibre4">menjak</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">uses instead either of two kinds of seeds, and by extension the word <i class="calibre4">mbeydo'</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">embraces a dose of divinatory seeds, just as though they were <i class="calibre4">mbey</i> or mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms. This usage indicates that in the thinking of these Zapotecs the role of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the vegetable hallucinogens is secondary. Both in San Agustin and in the Ma-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">zatec country it seems that there is recourse to the seeds or leaves only when the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms are not available. In the Zapotec of San Agustin the two kinds of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seeds are called the yellowish piule and the black piule, <i class="calibre4">men nagadz</i> and <i class="calibre4">men</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">nagat;</i> in Spanish, 'the male' and 'the young lady', <i class="calibre4">el macho</i> and <i class="calibre4">la Senorita.</i> We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">brought back with us seeds and leaves of the second kind, and they were later</p>

  <p class="calibre1">identified by Joseph Monachino of the New York Botanical Garden as <i class="calibre4">ololiuqui,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the famous Aztec hallucinogen known to botanists as rivea corymbosa.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Early in our visit we asked Don Aristeo to give us a mushroom session, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this he did on the night of Thursday, July 21. Don Roberto called on him that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">afternoon to pursue further the calendar problem, and found him casting kernels</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of corn. There was a heap of 51 kernels disposed in little piles, and he went</p>

  <p class="calibre1">through the casting five times, to learn what fortune he would have with us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that night.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We arrived at Don Aristeo's house shortly before nine o'clock in the even-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing. We were eight, our <i class="calibre4">menjak,</i> Don Roberto, Howard Brunson, RGW, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chico; Ismael, Serafin, and Pedro. The house was on the outskirts of town,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">down the mountain side, well secluded. It was a typical one-room adobe cottage</p>

  <p class="calibre1">312</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-124_1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with thatch roof, no windows, and a door in the middle of the long side. There</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was a table on the right as one entered, and a wood fire was burning in a circle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of stones in front of the table. Don Aristeo's place was next to the fire, where he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alternately lay and sat <i class="calibre4">onapetate</i> covered with sacks. There was a bench for some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of us to sit on, and the rest lay on <i class="calibre4">petates</i> where they pleased. The embers of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fire and a candle were our only illumination.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Slowly the program got under way. Don Aristeo prayed at length under his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">breath, and then opened a paper wrapping in which he had a large supply of</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Fig. 22</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">piule de barda.</i> He took out the mushrooms pair by pair, rinsed each pair well in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a bowl of water, and placed the clean mushrooms in another empty bowl,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">praying the while. Having rinsed enough mushrooms, he tied up the rest in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">paper wrapping, poured out the water on the ground, and then, pair by pair,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">took the mushrooms from the second bowl, severed the caps from the stems,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">placed the caps in the empty bowl, and held the stems in his hand. To our sur-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">prise he severed the caps of 25 pair of mushrooms. He explained to us that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stems are never eaten: they are respectfully laid aside and on the following day</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they are scattered (not buried) in any place off the beaten track where people</p>

  <p class="calibre1">will not pass.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Shortly after 9 o'clock, seated on the sack, he began to chew and then swallow</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mushroom caps, scooping them out of the bowl in one big handful after</p>

  <p class="calibre1">another, seven mouthfuls in all, chewing them at length. By 9.35 he had finished</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them. He lay down for a time, his head on a rolled blanket. Then he sat up,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">313</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_100"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_50">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">lighted a cigarette, and spoke conversationally. Toward 10 o'clock he began to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hum, and this became a musical hum, which in turn grew into a chant. He was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lying on his right elbow and made sweeping gestures with his left arm. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">asked our religion, and we thought it best to say Catholic. Then he said in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Zapotec that our son Peter was alive and would return to us, that we should</p>

  <p class="calibre1">address prayers to St. Augustine, the Holy Virgin, and St. Joseph; and that we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should burn votive candles of virgin wax in Oaxaca before the Virgin of Soli-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tude and later make a similar pilgrimage to the Virgin of Guadalupe. He said</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that Peter was in Vera Cruz, plunged in sadness, living a hidden life, slinking</p>

  <p class="calibre1">along dark back alleys, and longing to return to us. (No one had thought to tell</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Aristeo that Peter was really in the army in Okinawa.) Shortly before</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ii o'clock our <i class="calibre4">menjak</i> ate the caps of five more pair of mushrooms. His chanting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was low and feeble, and of course in Zapotec, but RGW had the impression</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the music was identical to what the Seiiora had sung with magisterial author-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ity in the Mazatec country. Don Aristeo reminded us that our primary purpose</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in consulting him was to learn how to use the mushrooms and become a <i class="calibre4">menjak,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">and we on our part did not disabuse him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We had known that Don Aristeo would not offer us mushrooms, for he had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">told us that only the <i class="calibre4">menjak</i> ate them. As the long night began to pall on us,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Roberto tried an experiment. He began to ask anthropological questions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of our <i class="calibre4">menjak,</i> such as the Zapotec ideas about the points of the compass. Don</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aristeo was far more responsive than he had ever been before, and it seems</p>

  <p class="calibre1">possible that the mushrooms offer a key to half-remembered things, a key that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">might be used in anthropological inquiries. But when all is said, it must be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">admitted that Don Aristeo's performance dragged, his vitality seemed low, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we were heavy with sleep. At one o'clock he told us we could go home. We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">think he felt the evening was unsuccessful: the initial dose of mushrooms that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he took was abnormally large, and he followed it with a booster dose, as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">though the response was not to his liking. However, we were well pleased with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the rich evidence that he had given us of the mushroom cult in this Zapotec</p>

  <p class="calibre1">area, the fourth cultural area in Middle America where we now know that it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">survives.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I3ut we have not done with Don Aristeo. In the course of our talks with him</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he had made a revelation to us that was so startling, so enigmatic in its impli-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cations, that we have left our discussion of it to the last.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Two of our early Spanish authors wrote of the religious observances that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">accompanied the gathering of the sacred mushrooms. The i6th century botanist</p>

  <p class="calibre1">314</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Francisco Hernandez spoke of. the 'night-long vigils, awesome and terrifying',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that accompanied the quest. Haifa century later, Jacinto de la Serna said that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">priests spent the whole night in prayer and entreaties before going out at dawn</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to look for the mushrooms. Our informants in the Mije and Mazatec regions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had known of no such religious practices, but Don Aristeo did.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our <i class="calibre4">menjak</i> told us that when he gathered the sacred mushrooms, he would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cross himself, kiss the mushrooms seven times, and say in Spanish or Latin</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(learned by rote, of course) five Pater Nosters, seven Ave Marias, five Credos, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seven Salve Reina Madres. He would place the mushrooms before the image</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Virgin of Guadalupe in his house, and each day during the observance of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4">noven</i> he would repeat the prayers and wash ceremonially his face, hands,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and feet. Thus in Don Aristeo's world the pre-Columbian practices recorded by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the early Spanish authors reappear, but overlaid with a Christian veneer.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the mushrooms of the fourth class, the hunter's mushrooms, are con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sumed, immediately after they are eaten the <i class="calibre4">menjak</i> places five righted candles on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the ground, one at each corner of a square with the fifth in the center. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom tells the <i class="calibre4">menjak</i> what spot to choose for this purpose, and flowers or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">leaves are also deposited with the candles. From the way they are disposed, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">five candles clearly represent the five cardinal compass points of the Indians'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world - North, South, East, West, and Zenith - and are the <i class="calibre4">menjak's</i> compass</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for discovering the direction of the deer. The <i class="calibre4">menjak</i> then addresses an invocation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to five divinities: to <i class="calibre4">mdldo'</i> or the 'lightning bolt', to <i class="calibre4">mdida</i> or 'Our Lord', to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Divine Pastor, to the Divine Huntsman, and to San Pedro Chapa in the Church</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of San Pablo Mitla. Only two of these five divinities bear a Christian aspect.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(The Divine Pastor belongs to the Middle American pantheon.) Here we discover</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our first association in Middle America of the sacred mushrooms with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lightning bolt, <i class="calibre4">el rayo.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is a third rite. Four days after the <i class="calibre4">menjak</i> gathers any of the divine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, he returns to the spot where he has found them and with candles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and flowers he gives voice to a supplication for an increased yield of mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the following year. He addresses his prayers to five divinities: -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1 the earth,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2 God the Father Most Holy,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3 the Trinity,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">4 the Great Lightning Bolt that bred <i class="calibre4">[crio]</i> the <i class="calibre4">piule (mdi'ndd' pse' btul),</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">5 the Great Lightning Bolt that put blood into the <i class="calibre4">piule (mdi'ndo' bio ren blul).</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Spanish: <i class="calibre4">El gran rayo que le echo sangre al piule.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The second and third of this quintet are, clearly, Christian interpolations. Omit-</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_51">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">ting them, we have left a religious explanation, wholly pre-Columbian, for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">generation of the divine mushrooms, and that explanation lies in the union of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the lightning bolt with the fecund mother earth. As Don Aristeo put it through</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our interpreters, <i class="calibre4">el rajo es lafuerza de la tierra,</i> the lightning bolt is the earth's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">force.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those of our readers who have long memories will recall that in Section 7</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we drew attention to the extraordinary range of the archaic belief in lightning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the generative agent for mushrooms. We documented this belief in ancient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">India, Greece, and Rome, and in modern Kashmir, Persia, and the Pamirs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Outside the Indo-European world, we found it among the Semitic Bedouin, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chinese, and the Polynesians of New Zealand. Now, thanks to the experienced</p>

  <p class="calibre1">handling of our difficult informant by Robert Weitlaner, we rediscover this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">self-same belief in a Zapotec village where the ancient Zapotec culture strongly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">survives. And in this Zapotec recension we pinpoint it with greater precision</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than elsewhere: for Don Aristeo and his people the divine mushrooms are the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">progeny of coitus between the lightning bolt and our mother earth.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At once the question posed by our evidence assumes new and deeper meaning.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Parallels in mythic beliefs among archaic peoples are of course numerous, but is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there any other example that is as specific in explaining a simple phenomenon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in nature? Plutarch pondered over the very belief that Don Aristeo, the Zapotec</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">menjak,</i> holds today, and Plutarch's puzzlement is as nothing compared with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ours, now that we discover the belief even in Middle America. Plutarch asked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">why men believed that lightning made mushrooms grow. Have we perhaps, at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the end of a long trail, discovered the answer <i class="calibre4">&gt;.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">No mycologist thinks that lightning causes or encourages mushrooms to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grow. It is therefore impermissible to suppose that the various branches of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">human family arrived independently at this notion by close attention to nature.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(We must not wholly exclude the possibility that the mycologists will change</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their minds. Scientists are as dogmatic about the knowable as churchmen about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the unknowable, but there is a difference: the dogmas of the Church are immut-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">able, whereas men of science change theirs daily without a blush.) Perhaps</p>

  <p class="calibre1">someone will suggest that just as men of science, unknown to each other, often</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hit on the same idea at about the same time, so archaic cultures may hit on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same mythic beliefs. But the analogy in its application to our enigma is invalid.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Scientists are working in a closely integrated, homogeneous intellectual at-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mosphere, and even if two workers have never heard of each other, they handle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">identical data and ideas. But who will assert that cultures far removed from each</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other in time and space must inevitably, in an early phase of their evolution, link</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lightning with fungal procreation? Surely independent genesis is highly im-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">probable.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But how about a simple diffusion of the idea? Today students of the neolithic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and later cultures know that cultural communication was active in those early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times over large areas. Technological discoveries, artistic and magical motifs,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and certain kinds of products would spread quickly to distant parts, thanks to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">contacts from village to village or to travelers plying the trade routes. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alphabet was invented only once, in the Near East, and by diffusion, that first</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alphabet led to the birth of scores of alphabets elsewhere. When tobacco was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">released from the New World, it penetrated everywhere in a few years, faster</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than explorers and geographers could travel. But was it not always the new</p>

  <p class="calibre1">idea or gadget that spread thus by diffusion, rather than mythic beliefs as old</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the hills? Sometimes with the birth of a new and aggressive religion, its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mythology would burst forth like a tidal wave and inundate an area before its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strength was spent. But if anyone is bold enough to say that the link between</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lightning and mushrooms was a belief propagated in this way, at what point in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">time did the diffusion take place and from what focus;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is the third possibility. Was not our belief handed down lineally for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">many thousands of years? Do we not discover in it a surviving trace of an early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cosmology elaborated when the ancestors of the Zapotecs and Greeks and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Semites and Polynesians and Chinese were neighbors, were not yet differentiated,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in their Eurasian home-land? The Zapotecs link lightning, not with all mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms, but only with those that by divine grace translate the eater to Paradise.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps their belief is the original one. On an earlier page we saw how mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms as primary tinder were linked with fire, and the procreation of fire</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with their aid was a divine event and a sexual act. Was it not a natural extension</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of ideas to suppose that the spark or spunk of fulminating Jupiter procreated the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">divine mushrooms? The Zapotecs could have answered Plutarch's question,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but he clearly had never heard of our miracle-working mushrooms. The popu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lar belief that puzzled him was an archaic survival in Greece that had lost its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning. If the divine mushrooms were still being used in the Aegean, they were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the secret of initiates in the mysteries. When myths lose their vitality like mol-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">luscs their shells last on, and the figures of speech, the anecdotes, being curious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in themselves, inspire popular etymologies, those explanations that are more or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">less inept after-thoughts. In this way the lightning that had once generated only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the divine mushrooms became associated with truffles and terfezia, with mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms generally. The 'fly-mushroom', which we think had once harbored the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">demonic fly of our sacred mushrooms, shrank to an ineffectual insecticide.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">317</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_104"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_52">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">With our Mexican experiences fresh in mind, we re-read what Jochelson and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bogoras had written about the Korjaks and Chukchees. We discovered startling</p>

  <p class="calibre1">parallels between the use of the fly amanita in Siberia and the divine mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Middle America. In Mexico the mushroom 'speaks' to the eater; in Siberia</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'the spirits of the mushrooms' speak. Just as in Mexico, Jochelson says that among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Korjaks "the agaric would tell everyman, even if he were not a shaman,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what ailed him when he was sick, or explain a dream to him, or show him the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">upper world or the underground world, or foretell what would happen to him."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Just as in Mexico on the following day those who have taken the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">compare their experiences, so in Siberia, according to Jochelson, the Korjaks,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"when the intoxication had passed, told whither the 'fly-agaric men' had taken</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them, and what they had seen," In Bogoras we discover a link between the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lightning-bolt and the mushroom. According to a Chukchee myth, lightning is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One-Sided Man who drags his sister along by her foot. As she bumps along</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the floor of heaven, the noise of her bumping makes the thunder. Her urine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is the rain and she is possessed by the spirits of the fly amanita.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There must have been a potent reason why from western Europe to Eastern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greenland people have believed down to our own days in the demonic nature</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of mushrooms, and we think that reason lies in the strange hallucinatory powers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of certain species. From Eastern Siberia to France these mushrooms are linked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with 'flies', i.e., the insect world that is itself saturated in demonic <i class="calibre4">mana.</i> Suddenly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Tadzhik myth of the falling 'lice' which give rise to a crop of mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">takes on meaning. Those lice are falling demons, falling 'angels' if you will,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and naturally they yield a crop of demonic mushrooms. And now suddenly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bosch's painting of those falling angels as 'flies' (= lice) takes on fresh meaning.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In that left-hand panel of the Hay Wain God sits on a thunderhead, and from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">billowing folds of his garments tumble forth the expelled 'angels' that will yield</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the crop of demonic growths, where the demonic toads dwell. The Tadzhik myth,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the falling 'flies' of Bosch, the 'flies' of the Paleo-Siberian tribesmen, all begin to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">relate themselves to the primitive myths of our own tradition.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our divine mushrooms, along with the secondary vegetable hallucinogens,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">may have played a role in the origins of human culture. How the strange virtue</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of those little children of the lightning must have stirred the soul of early man!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here is our remote ancestor of the Old Stone Age emerging from the mental</p>

  <p class="calibre1">confines of his animal background, possessed of only the most rudimentary tools</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and skills, knowing the emotion of fear but not yet acquainted with awe. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discovers the secret of our mushrooms. They produce in him a self-limiting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pseudo-psychosis, the fission of his soul. (How cold, condescending, and dubious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">318</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">do such medical labels as 'psychosis' seem to one who has known the truth of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the divine mushroom!) He experiences self-perception. He visits heaven and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perhaps hell, he holds the key to the miraculous. Yes, our mushrooms must</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have unlimbered the imagination of those first men who ate them, stirred their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">curiosity and speculative faculties. Our mushrooms could have sparked in them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the very idea of God. When Don Aurelio and our other friends tell us that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms translate them to God's domain, perhaps this is no modern figure of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speech devised for our benefit. The phrase that seems to us fresh and arresting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">may have been the conventional one for thousands of years. We may be tapping</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the very well-spring of the religious idea.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Let us pause for a moment to consider the name that the Nahua gave to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">divine mushroom - <i class="calibre4">teo-nandcatl,</i> God's flesh! How those words echo down the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">centuries of religious experience! (In the Book of Common Prayer, in the Prayer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Humble Access, the faithful are summoned to eat 'the flesh of thy dear son</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jesus Christ'.) The Christian doctrine of Transubstantiation is a hard saying,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">calling for great faith. (Who was that Saint who, in piety, said that of the miracles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there were three above all the rest, the Virgin Birth, Transubstantiation, and,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the greatest of the three, the faith given to man that enables him to believe in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other two?) The Mexican Indian with his <i class="calibre4">teo-nandcatl</i> has no need for Transub-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stantiation because his mushroom speaks for itself. By comparison with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom, the Element in the Christian agape seems pallid. The mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">holds the key to a mystical union with God, whereas only rare souls can attain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">similar ecstasy and divine communion by intensive contemplation of the miracle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Mass. Our Sefiora took of two elements, the mushrooms and <i class="calibre4">aguardiente,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">but the second she withheld from the laity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Is not the odd phenomenon of mycophilia vs. mycophobia a latter-day echo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of early man's shattering experience when he discovered the potent mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a response, positive and negative, divine and diabolic, to these holy miracle-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">workers? The toad of our 'toadstool' is that daemon which the Great Lightning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bolt seeded in the mother earth and which sprang forth in the little mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our readers will recall that the same word for 'mushroom' is shared by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indo-European peoples, the eastern Finnic peoples, the Paleo-Siberian tribes as far</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the eastern tip of Siberia, and perhaps even the Eskimos and the Arabs. Do we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not now discover the potent secret of the mushrooms that might explain the wide</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dissemination of a single pre-Indo-European word ? For the cultural historian it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">becomes imperative that the surviving traces of the mushroom cult among the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peripheral peoples of Siberia be minutely and sympathetically examined on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ground by anthropologists and linguists, and likewise the similar use of a mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room in the interior of New Guinea. It becomes imperative for the anthropo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logists everywhere to take cognizance of ethno-mycology as an avenue for prom-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ising cultural inquiry. In various directions there seem to be fruitful areas for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">re-study of ethno-mycological evidence, such as, for example, the strange absence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of mushrooms from the immense corpus of ancient Egyptian art and texts.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Is this because the Egyptians ignored the fungal world or because Egyptologists</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have ignored it; In China, long before the Buddhist era, in the Taoist philosophy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Lao-Tse, we discover the theme of the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">ling-chili:</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">wherein 'ling' means spiritual or potent or divine, and 'chih' is a word for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'mushroom'. According to the legend as it survives today, the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">ling-chih</i>&nbsp;was a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom that conferred immortality on the eater. Overlaid in the course of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">time by the artificialities of Chinese literary and artistic sublimation, this theme</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must have had its genesis in the country-folk and in a mycological fact. "Was not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the divine mushroom of the early Chinese our divine mushroom? Modern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">commentators such as S. Wells Williams in his&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Language</i>&nbsp;(1909) report that the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">ling-chih</i>&nbsp;was the fomes fomentarius or fomes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">igniarius. This could hardly have been so in the beginning, for these hard, bitter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tree fungi are inedible; though they could have been ground to a powder and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drunk in a potion. Perhaps it is significant that as the source of primary tinder</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they are linked with fire, and thus with the lightning bolt, and this may explain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">why they were chosen as evasive substitutes for hallucinatory mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Hu Shih, alive to our interest in mushrooms, has given us additional</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence of a knowledge of hallucinatory mushrooms in China. In the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Ching-i</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">lu,</i>&nbsp;usually attributed to T'ao Ku who lived in the loth century, there is a refer-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ence to a mushroom which, when eaten, will cause the disease of the dry laugh.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The natives call it the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">hsiao-i-hu,</i>&nbsp;which can be translated either by 'Shall-we-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">laugh?' or by 'Laugh - What! Not?' But Dr. Hu tells us that such a name is on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its face a literary invention. This mushroom is the 'Laugh-mushroom', as it is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">more commonly called, of which the statesman and writer Yeh Meng-te (A.D.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1077-1148) speaks in the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Pi-shu lu-hua,</i>&nbsp;'Notes of a Summer Vacation':</p>

  <p class="calibre1">320</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE MUSHROOM AGAPE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">... the Maple tree Mushroom which, when eaten, causes the eater to laugh without</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stopping, and is called the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">hsiao chun.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">or 'Laugh-mushroom'. What can this be but the mushroom&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">de pura risa</i>&nbsp;of our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">friends Ismael and Don Aristeo, of the botanist Hernandez, the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Nanenschwamm</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Germany and the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bolondgomba</i>&nbsp;of Hungary?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Buddhist world there is another clue to explore. According to orthodox</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tradition, the Buddha died after a Last Supper with his disciples at which he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reserved for himself a dish of tender boar's flesh,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sukara-maddava.</i>&nbsp;Some have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seen not pig but mushrooms on that fateful plate.&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Sukara</i>&nbsp;is cognate with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Latin&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sus,</i>&nbsp;English 'swine'; our readers will recall that&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">suillus</i>&nbsp;in Latin is also</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a fungal name. In Russia there is also a 'swine-mushroom', the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">svinukha.</i>&nbsp;In the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">light of our discoveries, should not this problem in exegesis be re-examined?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That the Buddha should have died as a sequel to eating bad pork seems a shock-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing discord hi the rarefied spirituality of the Buddhist legend. What could be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">more fitting than for the Master to be translated to Nirvana by the divine</p>
