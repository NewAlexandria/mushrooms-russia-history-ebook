  <p class="calibre1">-Cast of Moscow live a Finnish people on the Volga known as the Mordvines.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In their language&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">panggo</i>&nbsp;is the word for mushrooms. North of them and a little</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the east are another Finnish tribe, the Cheremissians, and 'mushroom' for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">ponggo.</i>&nbsp;Beyond the Urals are the settlements of the Voguls, who say</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pangkh;</i>&nbsp;and farther east, on the banks of the River Ob, dwell the last of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Finnish folk, the Ostjaks, with&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pongkh.</i>&nbsp;Scholars are disposed to accept the likeli-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hood that these Finno-Ugrian peoples have borrowed these words from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">West.1 Somewhat further to the east, in the valley of the Yenisei, the small</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tribe known as the Yenisei-Ostjaks are familiar with the amanita muscaria and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">call it the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">hanggo.</i>&nbsp;They are unrelated ethnically or linguistically to the Finnish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peoples, but they too have borrowed the same mushroomic word.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But the diffusion of the word does not stop on the banks of the Yenisei. Far</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the east of them are the Yukaghirs, a tribe culturally and geographically</p>

  <p class="calibre1">midway between the Finns and the primitive Paleo-Siberian tribes on the Pacific</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coast. According to Waldemar Jochelson, they are mycophobes, considering all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms unclean, springing up from dogs' urine. They have a word for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungus,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">can-pai,</i>&nbsp;of which the first element means 'tree'. Is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">-pai</i>&nbsp;related to our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Finnish words;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If we may digress for a moment, the pejorative association of mushrooms with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dogs' urine is not peculiar to the Yukaghirs; far from it. One of the fungal words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Hindi is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">kUkar-muta,</i>&nbsp;'dog's urine', and this corresponds with the Marathi term,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">kutrya-cem mut.</i>&nbsp;The Jews of eastern Europe refrain from eating the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that they call in Yiddish&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">hintishe shvemlekh,</i>&nbsp;'dog mushrooms', according to an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">informant from Chotin in Bessarabia; these are mushrooms that grow in damp</p>

  <p class="calibre1">places at the foot of trees, and that are believed to be contaminated by dogs. We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suspect that the same idea lies behind the generic word for mushrooms of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophobic Ingush tribe in the Caucasus. Their word is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">dzhahnuskul',</i>&nbsp;'dog's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bride', in which&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">dzhali</i>&nbsp;means 'dog'. In the Germanic language of the Faeroe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Islands,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">hunda-land,</i>&nbsp;'dog's urine', is a word for mushroom. For 'dog' the Poles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">say&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pies;</i>&nbsp;the feminine form of this word,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">psica,</i>&nbsp;is not used, but its plural,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">psice,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">1.</i>&nbsp;The diffusion of the word for 'fungus' among the eastern Finnish peoples and eastward in Siberia to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chukchees was pointed out by Karl Bouda in his treatise,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Das Tschuktschische,</i>&nbsp;Leipzig, 1941, pp. 35-36. He does</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not mention the Yukaghirs. We owe our information about them to Waldemar Jochelson's&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">The Yukaghir and</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">the Yukaghirized Tungus,</i>&nbsp;published by the American Museum of Natural History, N. Y., 1926, as vol. rx in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the series of the Jesup North Pacific expedition, pp. 334, 340-1, 419. For information about the Yenisei-Ostjaks,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">see Kai Donner's ethnological notes published in the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Memoires</i>&nbsp;of the Societe Finno-Ougrienne, vol. LXVI,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Helsinki, 1933.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">FROM 'PANGGO' TO 'PUPIK'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is a name bestowed on certain small mushrooms, probably coprini. In France</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungi of this genus are known popularly as the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pisse-chien,</i>&nbsp;and we suspect that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the deliquescent ink-caps underlie the other examples that we have cited. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pisse-chien</i>&nbsp;of the French becomes&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">thepixacan</i>&nbsp;in the langue d'oc: we have found</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it in Gascon, in Catalan, and in Majorcan, and doubtless it occurs elsewhere.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The ending&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">-can</i>&nbsp;comes down from the Latin&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">caninus,</i>&nbsp;of course. When we go</p>

  <p class="calibre1">further afield, we discover that in the Arabic spoken by the Sudanese there is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom called the 'tree-of-the-dogs',&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">shajarat al-kilab.</i>&nbsp;Arabic scholars have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been puzzled by it, but surely the meaning is clear. Indeed, the association of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coprini with dogs is not without justification. Those who care to get to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bottom of the matter will find shrewd and amusing observations on the subject</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by Camille Fauvel in the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Supplement</i>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Revue de Mycologie</i>&nbsp;of Decem-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ber i, 1946, wherein this former Commissaire de Police and counter-espionage</p>

  <p class="calibre1">agent reveals his discovery that the distribution of urinals and of the coprinus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">atramentarius in the environs of Paris is complementary: i.e., the fungi are sel-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dom found within a reasonable range of a urinal, but abound beyond that range.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Kamchatka peninsula there live, among other tribes, the folk known as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Korjaks. The word for mushroom in their language is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pion -</i>&nbsp;yet another</p>

  <p class="calibre1">example of our word. For more than two centuries the Korjaks have enjoyed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a peculiar renown among anthropologists, ever since the Swedish traveler Philip</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Johan von Strahlenberg discovered that they eat the dried amanita muscaria for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its intoxicating virtue. It is to be observed that the Korjaks do not use the word</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pion</i>&nbsp;for the fly agaric. This they call&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">wapaq,</i>&nbsp;meaning whale-bone, and here is why.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The tribesmen of eastern Siberia bend spits or skewers of whalebone, insert them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thus into tallow, freeze the tallow, and then scatter the lumps of frozen tallow</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for hapless wolves to swallow. The death-throes of the stricken beasts explain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the use of the word for the fly amanita, the trigger that sends men into frenzy.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">North of the Korjaks, in the extreme eastern corner of Siberia, facing Alaska,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He the settlements of the Chukchees, a tribe related to the Korjaks. For 'fungus'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they say&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pongpong</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pompong.</i>&nbsp;This doubling of a syllable is characteristic of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chukchee tongue. Here, then, we find the same word that we have now followed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the Mordvines in Europe across all of Siberia.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The range of this word of European origin for 'mushroom' is a breathtaking</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. Waldemar Bogoras in his treatise on the Chukchees assumes that the primary meaning of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">wapaq</i>&nbsp;was 'fly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">agaric', the word being then transferred to the whale-bone spit used in killing wild beasts. He offers 110 supporting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence. Since words for the divine usually recede from common use and give place to euphemisms, we suggest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the primary sense of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">wapaq</i>&nbsp;was the whale-bone spit and that it was transferred as a vigorous metaphorical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">euphemism to the psychogenic mushroom. We know of one expression derived from fungal&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">wapaq:</i>&nbsp;the spirits</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the fly agaric are called&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">wapdqual(fnu,</i>&nbsp;but as this means simply 'fly-agaric men', it tells us nothing about the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">origin of the word.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">thing. What is the explanation? Why should it have stabbed its way across the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">frozen wastes of the North to the Bering Strait? Unfortunately we know nothing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about the use of our word among these remote and primitive peoples. We do</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not know its precise applications in the fungal world. The lexicons say that in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ostjak and Vogul it designates the fly amanita, and this is certainly true of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">hanggo</b></i> of the Yenisei-Ostjaks. We do not know which uses of fungi are in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">minds of the people when they utter these words, nor what other meanings they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">may carry, nor the figures of speech in which they play a part, nor their role in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">proverbs and folklore. We know nothing of their emotional flavor. They were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not borrowed from Russian, for the Russian language possesses no word that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">could have been their source. We do not know whether they are associated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with toads.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Clearly these Finnish and Siberian words come down from one of our three</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungal clusters - the <i class="calibre4">pogge</i> or the sponge or the pumpkin group - or from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a common ancestor. Is it possible that the word sped east long ago, along with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a new technique for making fire - the use of punk for tinder» This would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggest that the sponge cluster was the source of the word. (In considering this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">possibility we must keep in mind that the superior virtue of the fomes fomentarius</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for tinder was known in northern Europe in neolithic times, some 8,000 years</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ago. Perhaps punk was one of Europe's earliest export products.) But there is no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence known to us to support this inviting surmise, which remains to be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tested in the field. Not only should every aspect of the words for mushroom and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungus be examined, but the whole vocabulary for the primitive methods of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fire-making as well - spark, tinder, flame, dust (soot), and ashes. In the course</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of our inquiries we have assembled straws of superficial evidence indicating a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">common phonetic element in the words for tinder, dust, and ashes running all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the way from Europe through Siberia into the Algonquin languages. When the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English colonists found the Algonquin Indians referring to ashes or dust as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'punk', could they have been confronting their own word, after a journey around</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the world?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By good fortune we do know that the Korjaks use punk for tinder, though</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we do not know their word for it. Waldemar Jochelson in his treatise on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Korjaks, page 565, has this to say:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The ancient method of making fire, by means of a drill, is at present employed only in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">religious ceremonies. Since the fire-drill is esteemed as the most important protector of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the family, it may be concluded that the Korjaks looked upon fire as a beneficent agent.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There are sacrifices in honor of the fire; fire is also a mediator between man and the deities,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">since offerings are burned in it. . . Tinder is prepared from a fungus that grows on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">140</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-202_2.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">FROM 'PANGGO' TO 'PUPIK'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stumps of birch trees. The fungus is stripped of its hard outer layer, and the inner spongy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mass is boiled in water. Then it is dried, and a light, brittle, and highly inflammable punk</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is thus obtained.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At this point our excursion into the Arctic would have ended, had not the demon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of our curiosity driven us to address a letter of inquiry to Professor L. L. Ham-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">merich of Copenhagen, the authority on Eskimo linguistics and cultural traits.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We asked him what word the Eskimos use for 'mushroom'. He replied that from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Northwest Alaska to Greenland the word is <i class="calibre4">pupikl</i> Here we seem to discover</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">once again the phonetic unit that by now we know so well. Professor Hammerich</p>

  <p class="calibre1">went on to say that the word is used for various diseases - in Greenland for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">leprosy; in the Kuskokwim district of Alaska for an eruption, itch, or small-pox.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(The reader will recall that Low German <i class="calibre4">pogge</i> is etymologically cognate with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'pox', and the European words are constantly associated with tumors and organic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">growths. Leprosy is often accompanied by gross physical deformities.) At Nelson</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Island <i class="calibre4">pupiki</i> is a person with small-pox. Then Professor Hammerich continues:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">141</p>

  <p class="calibre1">C H A P T E R F I V E</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the mind of an Eskimo the word <i class="calibre4">pupik</i> must needs associate itself with the root <i class="calibre4">pu,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">'inflate, rise to the surface'; cf., e. g., Greenland <i class="calibre4">pue,</i> 'tumor'; <i class="calibre4">puak,</i> 'lung'; <i class="calibre4">poq,</i> 'inflated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bag'; <i class="calibre4">puisse,</i> 'seal' (which pops out of the sea); Kuskokwim <i class="calibre4">pugoq,</i> 'rises to the surface';</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pugtartoq,</i> 'the seal emerges from the water for air'; and <i class="calibre4">pugtaun,</i> 'inflated bladder'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The reader who has followed step by step our argument will share the excite-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ment that Professor Hammerich's letters justify. Phonetically and semantically</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the information that he supplies seems to place the Eskimos with the Europeans</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in what we might call the same mushroom orbit. What is the explanation ?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Before suggesting certain possibilities, there is additional evidence to submit, also</p>

  <p class="calibre1">supplied by Professor Hammerich. Among the Eskimos who live south of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bering Strait, the word <i class="calibre4">pupik</i> in the sense of 'mushroom' seems to be unknown.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thus on the island of Nunivak mushrooms are <i class="calibre4">tumrat ciutait,</i> or 'devil's ears' — a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">metaphor that echoes the demonic theme of the North Sea mushroom voca-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bulary, and also the common name of the hirneola auricula-judse of the myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logists, a species of edible tree fungus known in certain European vernaculars as the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jew's ears or Judas' ears. The Aleuts, who are not Eskimos but whose culture is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Eskimoid, use an expression that is semantically identical, <i class="calibre4">qu^ani tutusi,</i> 'devil's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ear'. There is current today among certain specialists in Eskimo matters a theory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the culture of the Eskimos originated in Southwestern Alaska and radiated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thence north and east to Greenland. We might look then to the Eskimos of that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">region for evidence of the archaic mushroom nomenclature. However, our in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">formation about the attitude toward mushrooms of the Eskimos is still so meager</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that it would be premature to draw inferences from the distinctive terminology</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that seems to be current among the Aleuts and neighboring Eskimos. Careful</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inquiries specifically directed to our theme would probably uncover much in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">formation now unsuspected. On its face, a term like 'devil's ear' for a mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sounds like a euphemism replacing an older term that has fallen under a tabu.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is yet further evidence of a common substratum in the Eskimo and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">European fungal thinking. Arthur Thibert in his Eskimo dictionary published</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in 1954 gives <i class="calibre4">tunnuksak</i> for 'mushroom'. Professor Hammerich informs us that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this word means literally 'something like a tallowy boil'. In the old dictionary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Eskimo as spoken in Northern Alaska, by R. Wells and John W. Kelly,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">published in 1890, the word for 'mushroom' is <i class="calibre4">ahyo''ok,</i> where again the sense is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'swelling', 'boil'. Thibert also gives <i class="calibre4">puyut</i> in the sense of 'dried mushroom';</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Eskimo word's literal meaning is 'means of making smoke'. Do we not re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover here the early use of dried mushrooms for generating smoke that gave</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to English the word 'funk' ? We can carry these recurring themes to a higher</p>

  <p class="calibre1">plane. In the Eskimo dialect of East Greenland the earliest Danish scholars con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cerned with Eskimo linguistics discovered a word for mushroom that is written</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thus: <i class="calibre4">tarndydp poqattd.</i> It has been closely examined by a long series of eminent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">authorities: John Petersen, William Thalbitzer, L. L. Hammerich, and Erik Holt-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ved. They agree that it means 'the hunting bag of the little robber of souls',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the second element, which begins with our familiar syllable <i class="calibre4">poq-,</i> being the bag</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the first element being derived from <i class="calibre4">tame,</i> 'soul'. Here then, exactly as in nor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thern Europe, is an association of mushrooms with psychic or demonic powers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Eskimos thus link mushrooms with tumors, small-pox, and inflated blad-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ders, and on another level with psychic disturbance, and phonetically we re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover among the Eskimos words that suggest our <i class="calibre4">pogge</i> cluster. There are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">several possible explanations for this surprising parallel.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">First, the word that we have pursued across Siberia to the Chukchee <i class="calibre4">pongpong</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">may have leaped the Bering Strait and spread across the top of America, by-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">passing the southwestern Eskimos. On the western shores of the Bering Strait</p>

  <p class="calibre1">live the Asiatic Eskimos, in cultural contact with the Chukchees. To weigh our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">initial hypothesis, we should ascertain the word used by the Asiatic Eskimos for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom. This word is not known to us, and as the Asiatic Eskimos cannot</p>

  <p class="calibre1">now be reached, the question remains unanswerable. <i class="calibre4">'Phonetically,pongpong</i> could</p>

  <p class="calibre1">become <i class="calibre4">pupik,</i> for Professor Hammerich points out to us that the Asiatic Eskimo</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">saming,</i> 'wherewith', becomes <i class="calibre4">sumik</i> in Greenland, and the Asiatic Eskimo <i class="calibre4">tam-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">laxtoq,</i> 'brings to the shore', becomes <i class="calibre4">tulagtoq</i> in Greenland. But the difficulties</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the loan surmise are serious. When a people absorb into their vocabulary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a word taken from their neighbors, they do so to fill a specific need, and they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">care nothing for the etymological and semantic associations of the borrowed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word. Such associations become dilute or are lost altogether, and <i class="calibre4">a fortiori</i> when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the borrowed word has filtered through a series of languages. If, then, the Eskimo</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tookpupik</i> from the Chukchee <i class="calibre4">pongpong,</i> we are constrained to <i class="calibre4">divorce pupik</i> from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the cluster of Eskimo words referring to tumors, skin eruptions, and distensible</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sacs with which the Eskimos themselves, with happy insight, consciously link it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A second possibility is that the Eskimos once dwelt far to the West, in con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tact with peoples of European cultural stock, and took over the word and its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">associations intact, and then preserved them in a singular deep-freeze, until today</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we of European stock have re-discovered this cultural common denominator</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with us. Fanciful as such a suggestion sounds, serious scholars such as C. C.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Uhlenbeck have discovered numerous verbal roots that seem to be identical in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Eskimo and in the Indo-European languages, and have postulated a remote</p>

  <p class="calibre1">period of cultural contiguity between the two worlds.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Third, we must consider multiple genesis: that is, the possibility that an ono-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">matopceic root could spring up in more than one place in response to an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">identical imitative instinct. If this were the explanation, we should expect to find</p>

  <p class="calibre1">yet other peoples as remote culturally as the Eskimos from Europe who will be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">found to possess indigenous&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pupik</i>&nbsp;clusters of mushroom words.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Each of these explanations, examined severally, inspires little confidence. There</p>

  <p class="calibre1">remains a fourth possibility.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Let us go behind the common Indo-European language that is the hypo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thetical ancestor of all the Indo-European tongues of today, to that earlier lin-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">guistic stratum from which common Indo-European was itself descended. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">archetype of our mushroomic root may descend lineally to us and to the Eski-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mos, as well as those Siberian peoples that possess it, from the era before our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">own linguistic family was differentiated from an earlier stock. In this case the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Eskimo&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pupik</i>&nbsp;is not a loan word from Indo-European, nor is (s)p(h)ongo a root</p>

  <p class="calibre1">borrowed by Indo-Europeans from some other linguistic family. We are simply</p>

  <p class="calibre1">carrying back our linguistic tree to a remoter generation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On page 109 in a footnote we pointed out that certain philologists consider</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">fungus</i>&nbsp;and σπόγγος as words of pre-Indo-European origin, taken originally</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from some lost Mediterranean language. They question the identity of these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words with the German&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Schwamm</i>&nbsp;and the Slavic&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">gamba.</i>&nbsp;The conjecture that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we now offer would reconcile the apparent contradiction. We would concede</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that in languages remote from the Indo-European family we find true cognates</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of σπόγγος. We would suppose that this word, as it descended through the Indo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">European line, assumed a variant aspect in the Germanic and Slavic worlds.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The persistence through many millennia of a recognizable root for the word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that signifies 'fungus' would be a remarkable thing. It might testify to the sin-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gular importance of the role of the fungal world in the culture of these exceed-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ingly remote ancestors of ours. The religious and mythological and erotic as-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sociations of the mushrooms would explain this role, associations that we are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">still able to detect, though today they fade from men's memories and must be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sought by combing the oldest records. Furthermore, these associations are of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the very kind that would explain the dichotomy between mycophobic and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophilic peoples. Things that involve man's deepest emotions are viewed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by him through a&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">mana</i>&nbsp;of supernatural potency. That which is tabu is both</p>

  <p class="calibre1">feared and loved, unclean and holy, shunned and worshipped. As the old beliefs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">slowly faded away, each cultural community, no longer able to maintain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alive the balanced tensions of the original involvement, clung to one face or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the other of the primitive emotions, either rejecting the mushroom world or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">embracing the strange growths with a quasi-erotic devotion.</p>
