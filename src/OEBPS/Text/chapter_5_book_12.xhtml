        <section class="main" epub:type="bodymatter chapter">
            <p><span class="initial">F</span>or &#8216;toad&#8217; the Catalans say <i>gripau,</i> and a word of the same root, <i>grib,</i> is reserved by Russians to designate the mushrooms that they esteem most highly. What is the common semantic theme here, and do these words point to a commingling of toads with mushrooms in primitive thinking, long ago? Early in our argument we mentioned this strange evidence and promised to return to it.</p>

            <p>The words for &#8216;toad&#8217; in Europe, as we have seen, are numerous. They are all, we believe, evasive in character, euphemisms resorted to as a refuge from an early word that fell under tabu. That archaic term is unknown to us &#8212;&#8203; unless it be the Gallic <i>craxantus,</i> which comes down to us in a single citation. If our findings prove acceptable, there are about ten basic euphemisms for &#8216;toad&#8217; in Europe. We discover &#8216;the Poisonous One&#8217; in &#8216;natterjack&#8217;, in the Anglo-Saxon <i>tosca,</i> Breton <i>tousec;</i> and &#8216;the Burning One&#8217; in the Danish <i>tudse</i> and Swedish <i>tossa.</i> The Irish combine these two when they say &#8216;the Poisonous Burning One&#8217; &#8212;&#8203; <i>losgann nimhe.</i> There is &#8216;the Moist &#8212;&#8203; or &#8212;&#8203; Slimy One&#8217;: Welsh <i>llyffant,</i> Anglo-Saxon <i>yce,</i> Low German <i>utze,</i> and High German <i>Unke.</i> To these we add a cluster of words for &#8216;toad&#8217; from Eastern Europe: the Czech and Polish <i>ropucha,</i> Lithuanian <i>rupūžė</i> and <i>krupe,</i> and Slovenian <i>rapuch,</i> stemming back to words meaning pus, foul eruption, rash, coarseness.</p>

            <p>The Spaniards see in the toad a skin or hide &#8212;&#8203; <i>escuerzo;</i> and so did the Cornishmen when they still spoke their own tongue &#8212;&#8203; <i>croinoc.</i> The idea of gaseous distension lies behind the Latin <i>bufo</i> and the Russian <i>zhaba,</i> the Greek cpuaaXog; and the &#8216;cow&#8217;s udder&#8217; of the Albanian <i>thithelope.</i> We hazard the suggestion that the <i>padde</i> of the Low Countries, Scandinavia, and the British Isles is the same word as the &#8216;padding&#8217; of a padded garment. The color of the toad finds expression in the Latin <i>rubeta</i> and the Greek cppuvoc; &#8212;&#8203; unless this latter means &#8216;the Burning One&#8217;. The idea of excrement hides behind the German <i>Krote,</i> and was responsible, we think, for shaping the French word <i>crapaud,</i> and between these two lie the Romansch forms <i>cratun</i> and <i>crapun.</i> A third Romansch form, <i>rustg,</i> is mysterious; it could have lost an initial <i>k</i> or <i>g,</i> and in that case might have been originally <i>krustg</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b12-fn1" id="cp5b12-r1">[1]</a></sup> which reminds us of the Lithuanian word for toad, <i>krupe.</i> Or has it the same origin as the Italian <i>rospo,</i> which by its Latin root conveys the idea of scratching? The Spanish <i>sapo</i> is, we think, a Greek borrowing, meanning &#8216;snake&#8217; in Greek. The idea of swelling and inflation underlie the Austrian words, <i>brattling</i> and <i>brotze,</i> and the Bavarian <i>broz</i> and perhaps <i>braste</i> also. Finally there is the Old French word, <i>le hot,</i> &#8216;the Cripple&#8217;, with its demonic associations, for which a parallel may be found in the Austrian <i>bratze.</i></p>

            <p>There remains to be considered the Catalan <i>gripau</i> with its Proven&#231;al cousin <i>grapal.</i> The French <i>crapaud</i> evolved from the latter, and we find an additional derivative in the Romany dialect of central Europe, where the toad is called <i>grapodo.</i> Perhaps there are other traces of the same word. The Latin <i>rana,</i> frog, would normally evolve in French into <i><b>renouille</b></i> but the actual word is <i>grenouilk,</i> and that initial <i>g</i> has given rise to considerable learned discussion. Surely it is borrowed from the name of the toad. There is a familiar French saying: &#8216;Fin comme Gribouille qui se jette a l&#8217;eau de peur de la pluie&#8217;, or else &#8216;de peur de se mouiller&#8217;: &#8216;As clever as Gribouille who jumps into the water for fear of the rain&#8217;, or &#8216;for fear of getting wet&#8217;. Scholars have debated the origin and meaning of Gribouille. Who was this immortal simpleton? We suggest that he was merely a personification of the toad, which jumps into the water when disturbed by rain-drops, and that in Gribouille we discover the unique survival in French of the variant of <i>crapaud</i> that is still current in Catalonia, <i>viz., gripau.</i></p>

            <p>The root behind <i>gripau</i> is <i>grip-,</i> and it means what it says: to grip, to seize, to hold, to grab. There is one act in the life of the toad that is marked by a vice-like grip of altogether astonishing strength and duration. This is the act of mating. Everyone who comes upon toads at that moment in their life cycle, in the spring of the year, is held in horrid fascination by the spectacle. Countrymen know the sight from childhood. The smaller male climbs on the back of his mate and embraces her around the armpits. There he clings for days and sometimes for weeks, and cannot be detached from her by any interruption, even permitting himself to be cut up alive rather than let go. Instances have been reported where the forearms of the male have become ankylosed from their prolonged immobility. When the males outnumber the females, then the males clamber over each other on the single mate, and cling to each other and to her, even smothering her to death, and still they cling in a cluster to the corpse as it begins to decompose. These knotted clusters of toads find apt expression in the Proven&#231;al <i>grapal,</i> related as this word is to the idea of a cluster, as of grapes.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b12-fn2" id="cp5b12-r2">[2]</a></sup></p>

            <p>There is abundant evidence that the sex habits of toads gripped the imagination of our ancestors. Toads were a symbol of lechery, and so were warts and moles, with which toads were associated. Professor Meyer Schapiro has pointed out that &#8220;the conception of the unchaste woman tormented by serpents at her breasts and sometimes toads at her private parts is common in Romanesque and Moslem fantasy&#8221;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b12-fn3" id="cp5b12-r3">[3]</a></sup> Probably the supreme expression of this association of ideas is in Shakespere, when Othello, obsessed with jealousy, confronts Desdemona with his monstrous charge, and then in a terrifying passage drains the very dregs of his tormented being, rising to his climax when, at the end, he invokes the image of mating toads in a figure that would be foully obscene in any context but this:<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b12-fn4" id="cp5b12-r4">[4]</a></sup></p>

            <p>Bosch shows us this lecherous toad in the detail of his <i>Seven Mortal Sins</i> that we have reproduced on Plate xm. In Venice there hangs in the ducal palace a singular painting of demonic import, crowded with the creatures of Hell. It is attributed to a painter of unknown identity who is known as the pseudo- Herri met de Bles. In one detail we discover our giant toad squatting on the double bed and staring at its sinful occupants. In the mosaics of the Battistero in Florence, executed early in the 13<sup>th</sup> century, a supine toad is superimposed on the body of a supine woman, and here the meaning is revoltingly clear.</p>

            <p>There emerges, then, a clear picture of the toad as seen through medieval eyes &#8212;&#8203; poisonous, pustulous, lecherous, possessed of a strange capacity to innate itself with air; in its facial expression and in the disposition of its torso and limbs, the very incarnation of a soulless homunculus, crouching and jerking and functioning like human kind on the animal level of man&#8217;s dual nature; a horrible caricature in miniature of sensual man and miserable sinner.</p>

            <p>We suggest that the Catalan and Proven&#231;al words for &#8216;toad&#8217; were originally keyed to the mating act. In the fungal world there are many erotic and phallic associations, as we have seen. It would have been a happy solution to our problem <i>of grib</i> and <i>gripau</i> if we could have discovered in the Russian <i>word grib</i> the erotic associations that would have linked it with our interpretation <i>of grip au,</i> but they do not exist.</p>

            <p>The story of <i>grib</i> in the Slavic world is the same that we know well from the West. At one time the word designated a particular class of mushrooms. By its pre-eminence this class came to stand for the whole mushroom world, and its name became generic, usurping the semantic terrain originally occupied by the Indo-European words, <i>gomba</i> and the hypothetical <i>bu-dla,</i> which we discussed on pages 93-94. A glimpse into this curious history is offered to us by the <i>Book of</i> <i>Rules</i> of the Josif Volokolamskij Monastery for the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b12-fn5" id="cp5b12-r5">[5]</a></sup> wherein we learn from the refectory diary that the monks were served mushrooms regularly on Wednesdays and Fridays, the fast days. The amanuensis records sliced mushrooms, boiled sliced mushrooms, chopped mushrooms, mushrooms with sauce, and mushrooms with garlic. For &#8216;mushrooms&#8217; he uses only two words: <i>griby</i> and <i>gruzdi,</i> and it is clear that all kinds belonged to one or the other. Apparently all boleti were <i>griby</i> and all gilled mushrooms were <i>gruzdi. Gmzd&#8217;</i> still carries traces of this old meaning: it floats uncertainly in its specific application among various lactarii and russulas, though it belongs specifically to the lactarius piperatus.</p>

            <p><i>Grib</i> circulates chiefly among the mycophilic northern Slavs and the Slovenians. We think it is unknown in Serbian and Bulgarian, but it appears in Polish as <i>grzyb,</i> in Czech as <i>hrib,</i> in Ukrainian as <i>hryb,</i> and in Slovenian as <i>grib.</i> The idea inherent in the root is familiar to us: grubbing, rooting, scraping, digging, grabbing, gripping.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b12-fn6" id="cp5b12-r6">[6]</a></sup> It evokes the activity of the mushroom gatherer in the forest. Down into Renaissance times the Germans used <i>Griibling</i> as a name for some kind of underground mushroom, perhaps a truffle, and of course its etymology is identical. Was it accident that led to the use of the same root in the East for &#8216;mushroom&#8217; and in Catalonia for &#8216;toad&#8217;; Did not this usage emerge from the common pool of ideas that we have traced at length, a unified field of associations, albeit discordant associations inasmuch as the Slavs loved their mushrooms whereas all peoples rejected the toad?</p>

While slime, as we have shown, is semantically appropriate for a fungal word, the etymology that we espouse is semantically felicitous, and we are fortified in our position by the comments of Roman Jakobson, which he allows us to quote:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>&#8220;As to^n&#8217;fc, I have not the slightest doubt about its origin. The Slavic languages clearly attest all vocalic grades of the root <i>greb; -</i> (i) <i>greb-, (id)</i> the corresponding prolonged grade <i>greb-; (2) grab-, (20)</i> the corresponding prolonged grade <i>grab-;</i> (3) <i>gr&#8217;b-,</i> (30) the corresponding prolonged grade <i>grib-.</i> Thus: (i) Russ. <i>grebti, gresti,</i> Old Church Slavonic <i>greti,</i> to dig up, dig in, rake, spade, shovel, scratch, scrape, row; Bulgarian <i>greblo,</i> rake, oar; Russ. <i>grebdt&#8217;,</i> to disdain, <i>grebtd,</i> sorrow, <i>greben&#8217;,</i> comb; (la) O Ch SI, <i>pogrebdti</i> to bury. (2) Russ. <i>grab,</i> grave; <i>(20)</i> Russ. <i>grdbit&#8217;,</i> to snatch, grab, <i>iob;grdbli,</i> rake. (3) Czech <i>hfbiti,</i> to lie buried; <i>hrbelec,</i> curry-comb; (30) Serbo-Croatian <i>griblja,</i> furrow, <i>gribati,</i> to furrow; Russ. <i>grib,</i> mushroom.

                    <p>When Professor Jakobson worked out the foregoing etymology, neither he nor we had discovered the obsolete German word <i>Griibling,</i> for which German philologists give the same origin as he for <i>grib.</i> German mushroom manuals give <i>Grubenlorchel</i> as the common name of the helvella lacunosa; if this name is in actual circulation, it is a survival in Germanic of the <i>grib</i> root.&#160;<a href="#cp5b12-r6">&#8617;</a></p></li>
