            <p><span class="initial">N</span>ow the moment has arrived to examine the basic fungal words of Europe. The tie that joins toad and fungus continues to be our theme. But for a few paragraphs we shall immerse ourselves in evidence that may seem remote to our readers &#8212;&#8203; if readers there be who are still with us. Some of that evidence is well attested, but we are going to advance certain conjectures of our own, and if perchance these survive competent scrutiny, we shall have succeeded in discerning links between toads and fungi over a far wider area, and at a greater depth in time, than we would willingly have imagined when we asked ourselves, at the outset, our innocent and casual question about the lowly toadstool. As amateurs, we are rash in what we are about to do, and if we do not constantly qualify our probing remarks with locutions of modest timidity, this is to spare the reader at the cost of our inclinations.</p>

            <p>In 1901 the eminent philologist Holger Pedersen, then a young man, brought out a notable paper <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b6-fn1" id="cp5b6-r1">[1]</a></sup> in which he established the etymological identity of the basic fungal words that we are about to consider, despite the disparity in their looks. They circulate in all the languages of Europe, often two or three of them in the same language. In the Germanic world we may take the High German <i>Schwamm</i> as our type; in the Slavic languages, the Russian <i>guba</i>; in the Mediterranean world there is the Latin <i>fungus</i> and the Greek σπόγγος, &#8216;sponge&#8217;. Only in the Celtic languages have we found no native examples. In Germanic and Slavic the words mean both fungus and sponge. In the Mediterranean, by semantic differentiation the Greeks confined their word to the sponge, and the Romans theirs to the fungus, the Romans borrowing the Greek word for the other sense.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b6-fn2" id="cp5b6-r2">[2]</a></sup> There is no evidence that any of these words in recorded history has ever been linked in the minds of Europeans with the toad. But there is abundant evidence that all of these words have carried, in their very core, the idea of an organic swelling or excrescence or tumor. Thus the Greeks spoke of scrofula and of the tonsils as sponges, and parallel examples are common for the other words of the group.</p>

            <p>There is one remarkable quality that distinguishes all the words of our sponge cluster: they are emotionally neutral, by contrast with the pejorative flavor of the fungal words heretofore discussed. It is as though this whole family of words had always possessed a tough underlying personality persisting through the centuries, over immense areas, among peoples in every stage of cultural development. Even when a word of this group describes something disagreeable like a tumor, it retains a detached tone, by contrast for example with &#8216;cancer&#8217;. In the English language the Anglo-Saxons used <i>swamm</i> for &#8216;mushroom&#8217;, and this member of our sponge cluster lingered on through Middle English into early Modern English. We can pinpoint its last recorded appearance in the second edition of <i>Naturall Philosophy or A Description of the World,</i> by Daniel Widdowes, published in London in 1631, where it is used in describing the fomes officinalis, the <i>agaricum</i> of Pliny. <i>Swamm</i> in the end surrendered the field to the loathsome &#8216;toadstool&#8217;, to the toothsome &#8216;mushroom&#8217;, and to the learned &#8216;fungus&#8217;. But another word of our cluster is current in the name that the English give to wet, spongy land &#8212;&#8203; the swamp. And perhaps there survives yet another word, of greater importance.</p>

            <p>On an earlier page we saw that the idea lying behind the <i>pogge</i> cluster was a distensible sac, a bag or pocket or pouch, a belly or bulge or bilge. The English word &#8216;womb&#8217; comes down from the Anglo-Saxon <i>wamb</i>, and this in turn is cognate with various Germanic words of similar sound and meaning, including the Gothic <i>wamba</i>. As the Oxford Dictionary points out, the same root turns up in the rare word &#8216;gameson&#8217;, designating the quilted or padded garment that medieval knights wore under their armor to avoid chafing. This garment tended to bulge and belly, being designed to do so. Philologists have been uncertain about the ultimate affiliations of the underlying root of &#8216;womb&#8217; and &#8216;gameson&#8217;. We suggest that &#8216;womb&#8217; and our sponge cluster spring from the same source, and that in &#8216;womb&#8217; and the sponge cluster we discover a perfect semantic parallel for those elements in the <i>pogge</i> cluster that relate to distensible bags and fungi, and also for the Irish fungal <i>bolg</i>.</p>

            <p>Perhaps there is another extraordinary example, hitherto unidentified, of the same Indo-European root in Late Latin. During the early centuries of the Christian era the Roman legions were being hard pressed by the barbarian horsemen erupting out of Asia. In the art of warfare the innovation of the day was the cavalry, and the Roman authorities were struggling to overtake the alarming lead of the enemy in the handling of horses. Whenever they could, they incorporated into their own forces barbarian elements versed in horsemanship. It is not surprising that at this time important texts by veterinaries make their appearance in Latin. One of these veterinaries, Vegetius by name, writing in the early 5<sup>th</sup> century, describes a pathological swelling above the hoof of a horse by the adjective <i>gambosus</i>, the first recorded appearance of this word in Latin. Surely this is our familiar <i>gamba</i>, borrowed from the barbarians, used in its essential sense of &#8216;swelling&#8217;, under historical circumstances that make its appearance natural.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b6-fn3" id="cp5b6-r3">[3]</a></sup> (There is a curious and significant analogy for <i>gamba</i>, in the sense that we suggest, in the modern Dutch word <i>hanekam</i>, of which the primary sense is &#8216;cock&#8217;s comb&#8217;. It carries two other meanings: it is the vulgar name of the chanterelle, and it also designates a swelling on the hock of a horse.)</p>

            <p>The words of our sponge cluster have displayed a singular potency in grafting themselves into the vocabularies of alien peoples. Thus in Basque one of the three generic words for mushrooms is <i>ondo</i>, borrowed from the Spanish <i>hongo</i>, which in turn descends from the Latin <i>fungus.</i> (This borrowing, must have been relatively recent &#8212;&#8203; in the course of the past millennium or so. Of more subtle interest is the fact that the Basque word for &#8216;toad&#8217;, <i>apo</i>, possesses as a secondary meaning the idea of sponginess. We shall revert to this.) The Magyar <i>gomba</i> or <i>gamba</i> was drawn from the Slavic, as was we believe the Lappish <i>guobbar.</i> In Armenian our sponge cluster turns up in <i>sunk</i>, meaning mushroom, and this Armenian word was the source of the Georgian <i>soko</i>, which in the neighboring Svanetian language becomes <i>sok</i>. On the northern side of the Caucasus the Ossetians speaking the Ironian dialect of their language borrowed their word <i>zoko</i> from the Georgians, and by a not abnormal transposition, the other Ossetians of the Digorian tongue say <i>kozo</i> &#8212;&#8203; a far cry from <i>Schwamm</i> and <i>fungus</i> perhaps, yet genetically stemming from the same ancestry.</p>

            <p>In the valley of the Volga, to the east of the Slavic homelands, there live the Chuvash people. They are probably the descendants of the original Bulgars. When a part of the tribe, some fifteen centuries ago, began their slow trek to the land that we now call Bulgaria, the others remained behind and they retain to this day their non-Indo-European tongue. In the Chuvash language the word for &#8216;fungus&#8217; is <i>kămpa.</i> The nasal sound in the middle of that word is of singular interest. The Chuvashi could have borrowed <i>kămpa</i> only from the eastern Slavs, who for a thousand years and perhaps more, ever since the Russian language was first put on parchment, have been saying <i>guba.</i> The Chuvash word offers proof that long ago, when the Chuvash people took over the word &#8212;&#8203; we cannot say when this happened &#8212;&#8203; the Russian <i>guba</i> was pronounced <i>gomba.</i> Like the fly caught and held in amber, the Chuvashi have held for us the ancient and lost form of the Russian word. That Chuvash word is noteworthy also for its other meanings. It is used for certain tumors of the human body. It is also used for the genitalia of the cow, and thus recalls the Gothic <i>wamba</i> and the English &#8216;womb&#8217;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b6-fn4" id="cp5b6-r4">[4]</a></sup></p>

            <p>In the Indo-Aryan languages of the Middle East and India there is a startling family of words that seem both phonetically and semantically to belong to our sponge cluster. Thus in Hindi we find that <i>khumbī</i> means &#8216;mushroom&#8217;; in Sindhi, <i>khumbhī</i>; in Panjabi, <i>khumb</i>; in Lahnda, <i>khumb</i>. These are all traceable to a Sanskrit word, <i>kumbhikā</i> meaning &#8216;pot&#8217; or jar&#8217; &#8212;&#8203; the bellying utensil that we have already encountered in the Anglo-Saxon <i>būc</i>, meaning both &#8216;belly&#8217; and &#8216;pitcher&#8217;. In Sindhi we also find <i>phungī</i>, which is seemingly a mutation by metathesis of <i>khumbhī</i>, paralleling the identical mutation in Europe, where &#8216;sponge&#8217; <i>and gomba</i> are identical etymologically, as are <i>Schwamm</i> and <i>fungus</i>.</p>

            <p>In the Waziri dialect of the Afghan language known as Pashto we find for &#8216;mushroom&#8217; the word <i>xōmba</i>, and in the Mohmand dialect <i>xumbuṛī</i>, both derived from <i>xumb</i>, &#8216;pot&#8217;. Surely all these words bear witness to the ubiquity of the idea that underlies the thinking about fungi throughout the Indo-European world, and of the verbal root that expresses the idea. These Eastern words stir up a further reflection. A few pages back, when we were discussing the <i>pogge</i> cluster, we saw how Puck and other imps and sprites resided in the distensible sacs, the toads, and the puffballs that we were examining. If we may rely on the Arabian Nights, the jinn of the East were confined in pots and jars, whence they would escape, rising wraith-like in gaseous wisps, to condense into organic shapes and wreak their will on men. Is there here too a common denominator in the Satanic association of the fungi, linking the East with Europe?</p>

            <p>Up to this point we have shown the diffusion of our basic fungal words throughout the Indo-European world and among a few small adjacent tribes of other origins. How about the Semitic peoples? Here we uncover a surprising thing. Of the important words for &#8216;mushroom&#8217; in Arabic, one is <i>kam</i> or <i>kam&#8217;a.</i> Its etymology is unknown. It belongs both to classical or literary Arabic and to the colloquial language. In its application it is both generic and specific, sometimes embracing the whole mushroom world, but also designating that species of terfezia which among Arabs holds pride of place as a gustatory delight. It is reported in modern Persian, where loan words from Arabic are numerous, and in its specific sense is said to be commonly used by the market vendors of Damascus. Nor is this root confined to Arabic. In the Old Testament no word for &#8216;mushroom&#8217; occurs, but in the Babylonian Talmud and the Midrashic literature we find the cognate root KMH in both Aramaic and Hebrew forms. If our Semitic root was borrowed from the Indo-European world, it goes back far.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b6-fn5" id="cp5b6-r5">[5]</a></sup> Or are both words descended from a pre-Indo-European root? Or are we dealing with unrelated words that happen to resemble each other?</p>

            <p>Now we return to Pedersen&#8217;s classic paper.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b6-fn6" id="cp5b6-r6">[6]</a></sup> He undertook to reconstruct the lost Indo-European root that was the progenitor of our sponge cluster. He considered several possibilities differing only in details, and of these &#8216;sgwombho&#8217; may be considered typical. And at this precise point, after a long absence, our toad rears its head and thrusts itself once more into the stream of our argument. Curious about the origin of the Latin word for toad, <i>bufo</i>, we turned to Walde&#8217;s Latin etymological dictionary, and discovered to our surprise that philologists are disposed to consider it genetically related to the Russian word for toad, <i>zhaba</i>, through an intermediate form, <i>gabawo</i>, found in the dead Baltic language known as Old Prussian. For <i>bufo</i> Walde devises a hypothetical Indo-European ancestor, &#8216;g<sup>u</sup>ōbhō&#8217;. Thus leading scholars, without regard for each other&#8217;s problem, arrive at hypothetical archetypes:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>[s]gwombho</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>as the ancestor for &#8216;fungus&#8217; and</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>g<sup>u</sup>ōbhō</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>as the ancestor for <i>bufo</i>, which thus differ in only one essential respect &#8212;&#8203; the presence of the nasal infix in the word for mushroom! Though we are the first to propose that these two words are doublets distinguished only by the nasal infix, the Indo-European languages offer other examples that parallel ours perfectly.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b6-fn7" id="cp5b6-r7">[7]</a></sup></p>

                <p>This ancestral convergence of the two words could be regarded as accidental, provoking perhaps an ancient semantic overlap through paronomasia or punning, were it not for the weight of evidence that we have already developed, indicating an association of toads with fungi in the minds of primitive Europeans. In the face of this evidence, accident becomes the long and unlikely arm of coincidence. Perhaps traces of the underlying unity of <i>zhaba</i> and <i>gamba</i> survive in the vernacular terms of the Ukraine and Slovakia that we cited on page 78. Perhaps there is a trace of that unity, hidden behind translated words, in the Basque word for &#8216;toad&#8217;, <i>apo</i>, linked as it is semantically with both &#8216;sponginess&#8217; and certain wild mushrooms.</p>

                <p>According to Pedersen&#8217;s analysis, <i>Schwamm</i> and <i>gamba</i> differ from the Latin <i>fungus</i> and <i>spongia</i> only by a transposition of consonants, the common phenomenon known as metathesis. Thus <i>gamba</i> becomes <i>[s]pongos</i> in Greek. Pedersen chose to reconstruct his Indo-European archetype, the hypothetical &#8216;sgwombho&#8217;, from the northern forms. But was he justified in this; The northern forms have shown themselves fluid throughout the fifteen centuries of their recorded history. The Greek σπόγγος attested in Homer, has displayed a notable stability throughout the twenty-five centuries of its recorded history. May we not suppose that the Greek word is nearer to the archetype? If so, we suggest our own reconstruction of the hypothetical root:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    (s)p(h)ong-
                </blockquote>

                <p>And at this point the attentive reader will perceive that we are back in the company of those words that we associate with the Low German <i>pogge,</i> meaning &#8216;frog&#8217; and &#8216;toad&#8217;, the essential difference being the nasal infix that distinguishes all words of the sponge cluster.</p>

                <p>And so we now emerge from our arduous excursion among the words of the sponge cluster with a theory of our own. We believe that these words &#8212;&#8203; <i>Schwamm</i>, <i>gamba</i>, <i>fungus</i> σπόγγος &#8212;&#8203; stem from the same genetic root as the basic word &#8216;womb&#8217;, and that all these stem from the same genetic root as the words of the <i>pogge</i> cluster. That root was imitative in origin, and keyed to the idea of swelling. The progeny of that root has peopled the vocabularies of Europe with numerous words embracing bags, pockets, toads and frogs, imps, tumors, mushrooms, wombs, and sponges.</p>

                <p>Just as physicists discover the &#8216;unified field&#8217; where, at great depth, the disparate phenomena of matter and force turn out to be one and the same, so in our linguistic pursuit we may have arrived at the unified field underlying all of those disparate phenomena that, as we have seen, men associate together, subtly and half unconsciously, to this very day.</p>

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b6-fn3">This etymology, original with us, must stand up against the conventional one. French <i>jambe</i> and Italian <i>gamba,</i> &#8216;leg&#8217;, are usually traced through Vegetius&#8217; <i>gamba</i> to a Celtic root meaning &#8216;bend&#8217; or &#8216;curve&#8217;. That the words for &#8216;leg&#8217; come from the Celtic root we do not question. It is less clear why a veterinary writing in the 5<sup>th</sup> century should refer to a swelling on a horse&#8217;s leg as a &#8216;leg&#8217; or as a &#8216;bend&#8217;. We know that there was a close homonym for the Celtic word in Germanic and Slavic, that homonym meaning &#8216;swelling&#8217; or &#8216;tumor&#8217; or &#8216;womb&#8217;. We are not inventing a homonym for our argument. If we are right, the form of the word as used by Vegetius would indicate that it was borrowed, not from Germanic, but from Slavic, and this would confer on <i>gamba</i> the distinction of being the earliest recorded loan-word from Slavic in the Western languages. Heretofore the earliest recorded Slavic word is <i>strava,</i> &#8216;funeral banquet&#8217;, used by Jordanis in his account of the funeral of Attila in A.D. 453. For the crisis in war technology precipitated by the barbarians&#8217; use of the horse, see the opening pages of Ferdinand Lot&#8217;s <i>L&#8217;Art Militaire et les Armées du Moyen Age, Paris,</i> 1946.&#160;<a href="#cp5b6-r3">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b6-fn4">Our information about the Chuvash <i>kampa</i> comes from N. I. Ashmarin&#8217;s <i>Thesaurus Linguce Tschuvaschorum,</i> Book vii, p. 142, published in 1934.&#160;<a href="#cp5b6-r4">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b6-fn5">The Arabic <i>kam&#8217;</i> suggests the Germanic and Slavic forms of the Indo-European words, rather than the Greek or Latin. In the Jerusalem Talmud we find the root SPG in the form <i>s<sup>e</sup>fōg</i> meaning &#8216;a porous luxuriant growth, mushroom, sponge&#8217;, but this was undoubtedly a Hellenistic borrowing of the Greek σπόγγος The parallel between the Arabic and Russian words for &#8216;mushroom&#8217; reminds us of an astonishing parallel in fungal metaphors. A certain mushroom is called in Arabic <i>shaḥmat al&#8211;ard</i>, literally &#8216;fat-of-the-earth&#8217;. This corresponds to the Russian <i>maslenok,</i> which James Collins in <i>The Present State of Russia</i> translated by &#8216;fat-of-the-earth&#8217; in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Yet another basic fungal word in Arabic, classical and colloquial, is <i>faq&#8217;</i>, <i>fuqqa&#8217;</i>, or <i>faqqâ&#8217;</i>, from the root <i>FQ&#8217;,</i> meaning &#8216;whiteness&#8217;. Whether this name designates a white kind of mushroom, or whether, as in Russian and Basque fungal names, whiteness here connotes excellence, we do not know. See pp. 7 and 10.&#160;<a href="#cp5b6-r5">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b6-fn6">Pedersen&#8217;s careful and elaborate argument in favor of a common origin for Slavic <i>gomba,</i> German <i>Schwamm</i>, Latin <i>fungus</i>, and Greek σπόγγος seems to us conclusive, and is accepted in substance by Emile Boisacq in his Greek etymological dictionary. A. Ernout and A. Meillet in their Latin etymological dictionary suggest a Mediterranean origin for the Latin and Greek words, without however dealing with Pedersen&#8217;s argument, which is available only in Polish. Occasionally there are clusters of words that the philologist ought to study together, and such is the fungal vocabulary of Europe, a semantic field pervaded by related figures of speech and emo tional responses. No philologist has pursued this method. Our basic fungal words of northern and southern Europe possess identical semantic attributes. They mean the same things &#8212;&#8203; organic excrescence, sponge, fungus. They evoke identical turns of phrase, proverbs, epithetical use. In short, the words occupy the same semantic terrain, which would be unlikely if they descended from unrelated sources. We offer this as additional evidence, circumstantial in character, in support of the Pedersen thesis. As we shall see on p. 144, this does not altogether rule out the possibility that the same root is native to languages outside the Indo-European family. In short, both Pedersen and the Latin philologists could conceivably be right.&#160;<a href="#cp5b6-r6">&#8617;</a></li>
