        </header>

        <section class="main" epub:type="bodymatter chapter"> <p><span class="initial">I</span>n Europe the amanita muscaria is one of the most widely known of the wild mushrooms. It is the archetype for the &#8216;<a name="toadstool-12">toadstool</a>&#8217; tribe in mycophobic countries, being the first gilled mushroom that the mycophobe learns to recognize, that he may the better curse it. In mycophagic lands all country folk know it, and have devised for it a diverse popular nomenclature. The esteem in which the various edible species are held differs in different parts of Europe, but the obloquy meted out to the <a name="flies-2">fly</a> amanita is uniform and heavy. Its evil reputation far outruns its deserts. There is a general belief that the victim who eats it dies; yet we believe that this murderous accusation is unsupported by a single trustworthy case history. How strange it is that the fly amanita should be far better known than its truly lethal cousins, which in some parts of Europe, such as Great Russia, possess no common name!</p>

            <p>A mushroom that is merely lethal is less interesting than one possessed of the devil. Here lies, we believe, the explanation for the singular reputation of the amanita muscaria. This mushroom inebriates, it does not kill, and in all primitive societies inebriation, like delirium and even insanity, is held in awe as a manifestation of divine powers. The problem of the amanita muscaria is one of the most elusive that ethno-mycology has to offer, and one of the most fascinating. Can we show that its intoxicating virtue was known to our remote ancestors and that they made use of it? Did it play the role of an important hallucinogen in the early social history of Europe? For almost two centuries the slow debate has gone on, and the issue is still moot. Perhaps it is possible to adduce fresh evidence, but first we shall sum up the discussion to date.</p>

            <p>In the early 18<sup>th</sup> century, the Swedish traveler Philip Johan von Strahlenberg journeyed extensively in Russia, Tartary, and <a name="demonic-siberia-2">Siberia</a>. His admirable report, written in German, appeared first in Stockholm in 1730, and an English translation came out in London in 1736, bearing the lengthy title:&#160;<i>An Historical and Geographical Description of the North and Eastern Parts of Europe and Asia particularly of Russia, Siberia, and Tartary.</i>&#160;Von Strahlenberg was a thorough and conscientious observer. From his pages the western world learned for the first time of the Korjak tribesmen of Kamchatka, and how they consumed the fly amanita for its intoxicating effect. This nugget of curious anthropological information drew wide attention throughout the literate world, and the interest then aroused has continued up to now. Indeed, a bibliography dealing with this Korjak practice would be surprisingly long. Today we know that traces of it survive also among the neighboring communities of Kamchadals, and also among the Chukchees, the primitive people living in sparse and tiny villages at the easternmost tip of Siberia, across the Bering Strait from Alaska.</p>

            <p>Indeed, we know more. Far to the west of the Korjaks and Chukchees, in western Siberia, in the northern lands lying between the Ob and Yenisei rivers, we have fragmentary but reliable reports that the shamanistic use of the inebriating fly amanita has survived into our own times. Kai Donner, the Finnish scholar, states that the Samoyeds in this region eat the mushroom, and also the people known as the Yenisei-Ostjaks.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn1" id="cp5b13-r1">[1]</a></sup> The Samoyeds are not of the Finno-Ugrian culture, but the Samoyeds and Finno-Ugrians together make up the family of peoples known as Uralic. The Yenisei-Ostjaks, though neighbors, are of different cultural lineage, being one of those now scattered tribes, inhabiting the most inhospitable and remote corners of Siberia, grouped together for convenience by anthropologists as &#8216;Hyperborean&#8217; or &#8216;Paleo-Siberian&#8217;. Donner reports that the shamans of the Yenisei-Ostjaks, to achieve the desired psychic effect, eat seven mushrooms, for which their name is&#160;<i>hanggo</i>,&#160;a word clearly related to the Latin&#160;<i>fungus</i>&#160;like the other variants mentioned on pages 138 ff. Well to the east of the Yenisei-Ostjaks, east of the Lena River, but to the west of the Chukchees and Korjaks, there is another Paleo-Siberian people, the Yukaghirs. According to Jochelson in his study of this people, made two generations ago, they no longer used the fly amanita in his time but they preserved a tradition of its use in earlier days. Jochelson unfortunately failed to note the Yukaghir name for it, nor did he record the details of the tradition.</p>

            <p>More than two centuries have passed since von Strahlenberg published his book, and for the role of the fly amanita as an inebriant in Siberia we still must rely on stray data that anthropologists have happened to catch. A desideratum for Russian and Finnish workers should be an intensive ethno-mycological survey of all the peoples of Siberia, to discover every trace of the inebriating mushroom. In folklore, in linguistics, and in the details of contemporary usage, there must be much evidence concerning it that we now ignore. If we assume, as some anthropologists have done, that the Paleo-Siberian peoples (Korjaks, Kamchadals, Chukchees, Yukaghirs, Yenisei-Ostjaks, etc.) once roamed over most of northern Siberia, and that they were then sent scattering to their present peripheral habitats by irrupting Mongol and Turkic invaders from the south, then the use among them of a common Indo-European word for the fly amanita would certainly date back to the time before they were blown to the four corners. The specific application to the fly amanita by certain of these vestigial peoples of a word that in Indo-European is generic for all mushrooms poses an exciting question: did these Siberian tribesmen borrow the use of the inebriating mushroom, and with it the name, from the Indo-Europeans?</p>

            <p>Before the 18<sup>th</sup> century was out, in 1784, von Strahlenberg&#8217;s compatriot, the scientist Samuel Ödman, advanced the thesis that &#8216;<a name="berserk-going">going berserk</a>&#8217; in early Norse times had been a state of excitement produced by the fly amanita.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn2" id="cp5b13-r2">[2]</a></sup> The Ödman suggestion was taken up and elaborated more than a century later, in 1886, by the Norwegian botanist Fredrik Christian Schübeler in his <i>Viridarium Norvegicum I</i>. The Odman-Schübeler theory took popular hold in parts of Scandinavia and even gained acceptance there among writers of scientific and popular handbooks, school textbooks, and encyclopædias. Indeed, many educated Swedes and Norwegians seem to take the theory as accepted fact.</p>

            <p>In 1929, a specialist in the medical history of Norway, Dr. Fredrik Grön, undertook to challenge Ódman and Schübeler.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn3" id="cp5b13-r3">[3]</a></sup> He dismissed the fly-amanita explanation for &#8216;berserk-raging&#8217; as weakly founded and improbable, pointing out that nowhere in sagas or other early Nordic source is there a reference to the fly amanita. In this he has been recently sustained by Professor Magnus Olsen, the outstanding authority today on Norse literature and traditions. Furthermore, the ancient writings of the Mediterranean basin make no allusion to fungal hallucinogens nor is there a single mention of inebriating mushrooms in the voluminous source materials available to us concerning the witchcraft cult. Ödman and Schübeler had relied solely on the analogy of modern practices observed among the Siberian tribes.</p>

            <p>But their side of the argument has not lacked champions. On November 1, 1918, the famous Swedish meteorologist H. Hildebrandsson read a paper before the Royal Scientific Society in Upsala in which he recounted an extraordinary episode. It seems that in the war between Sweden and Norway in 1814, some soldiers of the Swedish Varmland regiment were observed by their officer to be seized by a raging madness, foaming at the mouth. On inquiry, it was learned that the soldiers had eaten of the fly amanita, to whip up their courage to a fighting pitch. We have not seen the Hildebrandsson paper, nor discovered the evidence contemporary with the alleged episode on which he relied, but both he and the society before which he appeared enjoy the highest standing in scientific circles, and his paper was quoted by Professor Carl Th. Mörner, a distinguished Swedish physiologist, whose avocation was the study of botany and the higher fungi, in two of his publications on mushrooms.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn4" id="cp5b13-r4">[4]</a></sup> The Ödman-Schübeler thesis received further endorsement from Professor Rolf Nordhagen, the Norwegian botanist, in an article in the Norwegian newspaper <i>Aftenposten</i> of January n, 1930.</p>

            <p>There is a tradition in Russia that the fly amanita was once used in folk medicine. N. Annenkov refers to this former usage as a fact in his <i>Botanicheskii Slovar&#8217;</i>, published in St. Petersburg in 1878. Rudolph Krebel in his <i>Völksmedicin und Volksmittel verschiedener Völkerstämme Russlands</i>, published in 1858, said that it had been used to treat lameness, but he is not precise in citing his authority nor in identifying the practice with a particular place or period. In some kinds of arthritis the exertions stimulated by the fly amanita might indeed be helpful. Perhaps there exist earlier treatises on Slavic folk medicine that will amplify these insufficient hints. In Professor C. Hartwich&#8217;s great work, <i>Die menschlichen Genussmittel</i>, published in Leipzig in 1911, we find on page 256 a sentence which, translated, says: &#8220;In a letter from a native of Zurich in 1799, in which year a Russian army under Korsakov was stationed there, the amazing statement was made that the Russians gathered and ate fly amanitas on the Zürichberg. Of course, the Russians must have learned to do this in their own country.&#8221; The pharmacologist Emil Eidenbenz of Zurich has gone to considerable pains for us in looking for the letter on which Professor Hartwich relied, but with no success. Thus a promising hint, on inquiry, yields meager results.</p>

            <p>Our European ancestors had opportunities to witness the inebriation caused by the fly amanita, it only when accidents occurred. There are numerous medical case histories of such episodes. One of the best is to be found in a paper by Dr. M. Roch, a physician attached to the Cantonal Hospital in Geneva, entitled &#8216;Les Empoisonnements par les champignons&#8217;, published in the <i>Bulletin</i> of the Société Botanique de Genève, 2nd series, 1913, where he reports on the wild delirium of four Italian laborers in the Canton of Neuchâtel after they had eaten a mess of fly amanitas. The delirium was followed by sleep, and sleep by a return to normal sobriety. Such episodes must have occurred from earliest times, and must have aroused the awe that the astonishing symptoms would naturally inspire among people whose lives were shaped by beliefs in supernatural forces. But in the early treatises on mushrooms, before von Strahlenberg&#8217;s journey into Siberia, we find no intoxicating properties attributed to the amanita muscaria.</p>

            <p>It seems clear that cooking attenuates or kills the distinctive virtue of the fly amanita. In Italy and France it is not rare to find individuals who habitually eat this mushroom with impunity. Our friend Camille Fauvel, the mightiest mycophage of us all, informs us that he has sat down to a mess of fly amanitas scores of times. He gathers the mushrooms, peels the caps, discards the stems, and cooks the peeled caps in any of the usual ways. Holger Lundbergh of New York reports to us that his mother in Sweden was taught by the famous painter Anna Boberg, née Scholander, to add a snippet of the cap of a fly amanita in preparing all mushroom dishes, in order to point up the flavor. Whence came this astonishing culinary secret, uncovered thus in the heart of mycophobic Sweden? Mrs. Boberg can hardly have hit on it herself. Did she pick it up elsewhere in Europe? Or was it indigenous to Sweden, the final emanation of some ancient esoteric lore, possibly distorted beyond recognition from its original purpose and aspect?</p>

            <p>For the best accounts of the symptoms of fly-amanita inebriation, we turn to the observations of Waldemar Bogoras and Waldemar Jochelson during their visits to Kamchatka a generation ago. (Their studies were published by the American Museum of Natural History as parts of the memoirs of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition.) On eating the mushrooms a period of exaltation ensues, in which the chewers of the raw mushrooms shout and rage. Then they engage in feats of prodigious physical exertion and experience illusions of radical changes in all dimensions, of miraculous mobility, of metamorphosis. The folklore of northern Europe is filled with supernatural phenomena that remind us of these symptoms, as for example the powers of mobility attributed to witches and werewolves. But are mushrooms ever mentioned in those tales?</p>

            <p>Of themselves, these analogies from folklore carry no weight, and indeed we must be cautious about false clues. Take for example the strange case of <a name="alice-in-wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a>. Shortly after her adventures begin, this enchanting child nibbles at a mushroom, and it produces in her the typical sense of changed dimensions that we recall in the horrifying accounts of the amanita-eating Korjaks. All of Alice&#8217;s subsequent distortions, softened by the loving irony of Lewis Carroll&#8217;s imagination, retain the flavor of mushroomic hallucinations. Is there not something uncanny about the injection of this mushroom into Alice&#8217;s story? What led the quiet Oxford don to hit on a device so felicitous, but at the same time sinister for the initiated readers, when he launched his maiden on her way? Did he dredge up this curious specimen of wondrous and even fearsome lore from some deep well of half-conscious folk-knowledge ? On first reflection that mushroom in <i>Alice</i>, so innocent for the uninformed, seems like a gentle aftermath, a distant reminder, of awful rumblings from barbaric times now forgotten; like the long, harmless swell that rocks the sea many days after the havoc of the hurricane. The temptation is strong to espouse this romantic hypothesis, and for the purposes of the controversy among Scandinavian scholars, this would tilt the balance, and the ayes would have it.</p>

            <p>But we think that Alice&#8217;s mushroom grew in Kamchatka, not in the forests of primeval Europe. It was on July 4, 1862, while rowing gently up the Isis to Godstow, that Lewis Carroll embarked on Alice&#8217;s adventures, holding three little maidens spellbound by the tale. Over the following months he put the story into final form, and presented the completed manuscript to Alice for Christmas in the same year. Now it so happens that the earliest popular manual on mushrooms in the English language made its appearance in that same year, M. C. Cooke&#8217;s <i>A Plain and Easy Account of British Fungi</i>. We do not know exactly when it came on the market, but we know that it was the subject of a lengthy review in the October 4 issue of <i>The Gardeners Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette</i>. (The reviewer commended Cooke&#8217;s efforts, and then conceded the hopeless mycophobia of the English: &#8220;&#8230; notwithstanding all that is said in favour of mushrooms, we suspect it will take a long time to remove the deep rooted prejudice that exists against them in this country, and teach our rustic population those that are harmless.&#8221;) Cooke&#8217;s little volume describing strange fungal growths was of a kind to attract Alice&#8217;s creator. On pages 20-21 Cooke discusses the use to which the fly amanita is put by the Korjaks, and its effects on the eater: &#8220;The natural inclinations of the individual become stimulated. The dancer executes a <i>pas d&#8217;extravagance</i>, the musician indulges in a song, the chatterer divulges all his secrets, the orator delivers himself of a philippic, and the mimic indulges in caricature. <i>Erroneous impressions of size and distance are common occurrences</i>, a straw lying in the road becomes a formidable object, to overcome which a leap is taken sufficient to clear a barrel of ale or the prostrate trunk of a British oak.&#8221; (The italics are ours; the reader will note the Gilbertian flavor of the oak that had to be &#8216;British&#8217;.) In Lewis Carroll&#8217;s diaries we learn that he began putting Alice&#8217;s adventures on paper on November 13, well after Cooke&#8217;s volume was on the market. For more than four months his tale had been taking shape in his mind, a period when he must have been ripe for such suggestions as Cooke had to offer.</p>

            <p>With a shout of discovery we leap to the conclusion that Alice&#8217;s mushroom is the one that Cooke serves us. The timing is perfect. Surely the progenitor of Alice, in the cloistered retreat of Christ Church, with Cooke&#8217;s manual at hand, transmuted the untamed practices of the uncivilized Korjaks into the poetry of wonderland.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn5" id="cp5b13-r5">[5]</a></sup> But no sooner do we reach this presumption than doubt re-enters, raising an admonitory finger. Can we be sure there was no native memory of a miracle-working mushroom? We turn to the English translation of Jacob Grimm&#8217;s <i>Teutonic Mythology</i>, and there in volume 4, on page 1412, we find the following statement, based on an Irish fairy-tale that we have not succeeded in locating: &#8220;The Elf-King sits under a great <a name="toadstool-13">toadstool</a>, and whoever carries a toadstool about him grows small and light as an elf.&#8221; Certainly Lewis Carroll never read this reference in Grimm, but Grimm&#8217;s wonder-working fungus of Irish lineage long antedated Cooke and von Strahlenberg, and Alice on her journey may have encountered this native mushroom. Once again our inquiries leave us poised between yes and no.</p>

            <p>If on balance we incline to the view that Cooke inspired the mushroom episode in <i>Alice</i>, this is because Cooke&#8217;s influence is clearly felt in Charles Kingsley&#8217;s famous novel, <i>Hereward, the Last of the English</i>, published in 1866. In Chapter 10 Kingsley introduces to his readers an old Lappish nurse, living in England, who possessed the secret of the &#8220;scarlet toadstools&#8221;. She adds their juice to the men&#8217;s ale, and makes them <a name="laughter-1">laugh</a> and roar, "merry-mad everyone of them", and thus she extracts from them their secrets. Kingsley in the story expressly denies that the English of pre-Conquest times knew the virtues of the &#8220;strange fungus, with which Lapps and Samoiedes have, it is said, practised wonders for centuries past&#8221;. In any case, the historical novelist is not an historical source. He too had read his Cooke, or some other of the earlier writers about the Korjaks, and to adorn his plot he fathered on the Lapps the practices of the Siberian tribes remote from them and remoter still from England. But today we know that he was right about the Samoyeds. Will some persistent inquirer someday discover that the Lapps knew the secret too?</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">I</span>n the annals of Europe&#8217;s cultural history it is hard to find a parallel for the polemic over the fly amanita&#8217;s rôle in the Viking world. Ödman published the initial paper in 1784, and at a glacial pace the controversy has simmered since then in Scandinavia and nowhere else. In English and German mycological writings one sometimes happens on allusions to it, but only allusions. Yet for the ethno-mycologist and the student of northern Europe&#8217;s early culture the problem will not stay laid, so long as the meager and tantalizing evidence hangs balanced as it does today.</p>

            <p>We believe a new approach to the enigma of the fly amanita is to be found in the history of word meanings. We intend to propose a novel reason for the link that binds the famous mushroom with the fly. This is a bold undertaking, for the traditional explanation, the official and orthodox explanation, has seemed to everyone for centuries to be full, perfect, and sufficient. Indeed, the argument in favour of orthodoxy in this instance is so strong that if we should succeed in our challenge, our triumph in this our secluded garden of intellectual disputation would be high drama, even if only in a minor key: caviar for initiates.</p>

            <p>Everyone who knows the first thing about wild mushrooms knows why the fly amanita is so called: it kills the flies that feed on it and until modern times it was used as a household insecticide on the Continent. This is what all the books say. What is more, there is a large part of Europe where the untutored rustics, the people who read no books, also accept the story as part of their legacy of folk knowledge. It belongs to that curious fund of &#8216;facts&#8217; that people keep repeating to each other and believing, without verification or analysis, like the saying that all Russians are good linguists. The area of Europe where our folk belief prevails is extensive but not all-inclusive. It embraces the Slavic world, the Germanic world except the British Isles, the Vosges, where Franco-German bilingualism prevails, and one or two enclaves elsewhere in France. The ancient authors, though they have much to say about the fungi, never refer to a <a name="fly-killer-2">fly-killer</a>, and in modern Italy among the country folk we believe the association with the fly is unknown, but ouf inquiry has not been exhaustive. It is unknown among the Basques, and apparently to all the rural population of the Iberian peninsula. If we judge by Eugène Rolland&#8217;s evidence in his <i>Flore Populaire</i>, in France the name <i>tue-mouche</i>, &#8216;kill-fly&#8217;, is indigenous only in Alsace and the Aude, though thanks to the mushroom manuals, it is now familiar to a sprinkling of educated Frenchmen elsewhere. (Rolland reports that at Val-d&#8217;Ajol in the Vosges the natives hang the fly amanita from the ceiling, where, he says, it draws flies to their death.) By contrast the German <i>Fliegenschwamm</i> or &#8216;fly-fungus&#8217; has its variants in all the German dialects, and also in Dutch and the Germanic languages of Scandinavia, but not in English. (The &#8216;<a name="fly-agaric-4">fly agaric</a>&#8217; and &#8216;fly amanita&#8217; of England are learned inventions of the past two centuries.) The Russians say <i>mukhomor</i> or &#8216;fly-killer&#8217;, and parallel terms are found on the tongues of other peoples of the Slavic family.</p>

            <p>In short, the fly amanita is linked with the fly almost solely among the Germanic and Slavic peoples of northern Europe. We can trace it back six centuries, and in a series of quotations we are going to document this folk belief from the Middle Ages down to the Age of Science. We shall prove that its credentials have been seasoned with time. We shall suggest that what has long been believed may be only part of the truth, or even wholly false.</p>

            <p>The earliest reference to the fly amanita known to us is in <i>De Vegetabilibus</i>, the considerable work on the vegetable kingdom written in the 13<sup>th</sup> century by Albertus Magnus. Twice he speaks of it and on each occasion refers to its fly-killing powers:</p>

            <blockquote>
                [1]

                <p>Tuber enim, quod vocatur muscarum, venenosum est;
                et si lacti immisceatur, et muscæ cadant super lac
                illud, gustantes ipsum, inflantur et moriuntur. Est
                autem illud tuber in superficie latum, et ad rubedinem
                declinans, habens in superficie ampullas, sicut sunt
                ampullæ in pelle valde leprosi hominis, in quibus non
                est humor, sed ventositas quædam interclusa. &#8212; <i>De Vegetabilibus</i>, BOOK II, Chap. 6: 87.</p>

                <p>For the mushroom that is called flies&#8217; [mushroom] is poisonous; and if it be mixed with milk, and flies fall upon that milk, upon tasting it they swell up and die. Moreover, that mushroom is broad, and tends to redness, having on the surface vesicles, such as are the vesicles on the skin of a very leprous man, in which not moisture, but a certain windiness is enclosed.</p>

                [2]

                <p>In nostris autem habitationibus invenitur fungus, qui latus est et spissus, aliquid ruboris habens in superficie, et in illo rubore habet multas ampullas elevatas, quarum quædam fractæ sunt, quædam non: et ille mortalis est, et statim interficiens, et vocatur fungus muscarum, eo quod in lacte pulverizatus interficit muscas. <i>Idem</i>, BOOK vi, Chap. 7: 345.</p>

                <p>Among our dwellings, moreover, there is found a fungus that is wide and thick, having a little ruddiness on its surface; and in that ruddiness it has many raised vesicles, of which some are broken, some not; and that [fungus] is death-dealing, and kills immediately, and is called flies&#8217; fungus for this reason, that when pulverized in milk it kills flies.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The quotations are taken from pages 136 and 517 of the text edited by Carl Jessen and published in Berlin in 1867.</p>
            <p>A century later, in the years 1349-50, another German, Konrad von Megenberg, wrote <i>Das Buck der Natur</i>, the earliest work on natural science in the German language. He devotes a paragraph to various fungi, and ends up with some quaint sentences about the amanita muscaria. Writing in the Bavaro-Austrian dialect, he said:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Es ist auch einer anderley schwammen die seind zuomal unreyn die seind breit und dick und oben rot mit weyssen bleyterlen. Wann man die zuo milch mischt so deet er die muggen. Darumb heyssen es muggennschwammen. Und zuo latein mustineti[?].</p>

                <p>There is also another kind of fungi which is wholly unclean; they are broad and on top red with white little plaques. When one mixes them with milk, they kill flies. Therefore are they called <i>muggennschwammen</i> [i.e., &#8216;fly-fungi&#8217;] and in Latin <i>mustineti[?].</i></p>
            </blockquote>  

            <p>We have taken our text from the earliest printed edition, dated 1475.</p> <p>Our third author is likewise German, Valerius Cordus, known sometimes as the father of modern pharmacology, whose untimely death at the age of 29 in the year 1544 was considered by his Renaissance contemporaries, the scholars of the New Learning, as the crudest of blows and an irreparable loss. In his <i>Adnotationes</i> or commentaries on Dioscorides he too devotes one paragraph to mushrooms, and one sentence to the fly amanita. In his text we find the earliest use known to us of the modern German name <i>Fliegenschwamm:</i></p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Sub Betulis arboribus in candido &amp; rufo colore varii nascuntur Fungi, quos <i>Fliegenschivemme</i>, id est, Muscarios fungos vocamus, quoniarn muscas lacte intriti occidunt.</p>

                <p>Under birch trees, white and red in color, spring up various fungi that we call <i>Fliegenschwämme</i>, that is, &#8216;fly-fungi&#8217;, since when crumpled in milk they kill flies.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The father of the science of mycology is the designation that has often been bestowed on Charles de Lécluse, a Frenchman of Arras, whose contributions to botany make him a major figure in the history of that branch of knowledge. The year 1601 saw the publication in Antwerp of his <i>Rariorum Plantarum Historia</i>, an important work in which a sizeable section was devoted to the fungi of Hungary, or &#8216;Pannonia&#8217; as the region was called. Carolus Clusius, the name by which De Lécluse is better known, was the first writer on mushrooms who fixed on them his gaze, describing them with the fidelity of a man who sees and puts down on paper what he sees. His description of the amanita muscaria is exact, and then he refers to the flies:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Invenitur etiam hsec species in cæduis silvis Francofurto ad Mcenum vicinis, unde rusticæ mulieres lectam, in urbem deferunt venalem, cum non ignorent plerosque empturos ad muscas necandas: nam cum, ut dixi, muscæ libenter illi insideant, divulsam in fragmenta, varijs in conclavi locis ante fenestras spargere solent, ad quae invitatæ &amp; excitæ muscas, succum sugunt ipsis perniciosum, &amp; paulo post etiam lethalem.</p>

                <p>This species is also found in the aged forests around Frankfort-on-the-Main, where it is collected by peasant women and brought to the city for sale. Since most of the buyers know it well, they buy it to kill flies with. And so, as I said before, since the flies like to sit [on these mushrooms] people scatter them in pieces around the room and strew them before the windows; the flies, attracted and excited, suck the juice which is poisonous for them and soon die.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Albertus Magnus, von Megenberg, Valerius Cordus, Carolus Clusius &#8212;&#8203; here is a formidable foursome supporting with their testimony the traditional view of the fly amanita. A critic, however, might find occasion for certain reservations. All four were Germans or writing against a background of German experience.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn6" id="cp5b13-r6">[6]</a></sup> Why did not the Greek, Latin, French, and Italian writers report the same phenomenon? The credibility of Albertus Magnus is somewhat impugned by his description of the mushroom: the amanita muscaria has no windy <a name="pustule-4">pustules</a> suggestive of lepers. The Doctor Universalis must never have focused his eyes on the fungus he was describing: at least part of what he said was hearsay. Von Megenberg exposes himself to the same criticism. Just before the sentences about the fly amanita, he has described another species, the <i>Pfifferling</i>, which in his day meant the lactarius piperatus, and he erroneously declares that it is a mortal poison. Here, translated, are his words: " One must watch out, for they are often most poisonous and can sometimes make a man deathly ill&#8230; We have an instance of this in Austria: a man ate a dish of <i>Pfifferling</i> and then drank strong mead, and he died at once in front of the barrel. This is true, by God!" As witnesses, both Albertus Magnus and von Megenberg would be in trouble on cross-examination by opposing counsel: their writings are a blend of the learning and the hearsay of their time. Valerius Cordus&#8217; brief statement adds nothing beyond his own adherence to a popular belief. Clusius introduces a new note: he is the first to inform us that the use of the fly amanita as an insecticide was exceptional: he places the custom around Frankfort, and by implication tells us that it was not known elsewhere. He was a traveled man, and he lived in Frankfort from 1587 to 1593.</p>

            <p>There is a peculiar thing about Clusius&#8217; remarks on the fly fungi. He does not consider these mushrooms a species. He describes them under the heading of Genus XII of pernicious mushrooms, and this genus he sub-divides into five or six species, all of which he says kill flies. With the aid of Clusius&#8217; water-colors preserved in Leiden, the Hungarian scholar Dr. Gy. Istvánffi de Czík-Madéfalva has identified these species, two of them being russulas, one of them certainly a cortinarius, and two of them amanitas.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn7" id="cp5b13-r7">[7]</a></sup> When Clusius reports the use of a fly fungus by the housewives of Frankfort, he is referring to the amanita muscaria. As Clusius was a reliable reporter, we must keep in mind that in former times, when the tradition of fly-killing fungi was still strong in folklore, not one but several species probably bore this designation. This leads us to Linnaeus. The great Swedish scientist in his <i>Flora Svecica</i> repeated the statement about killing flies, but instead of placing the custom in Frankfort, he said it prevailed in Smolandia, a Swedish province where he had spent his childhood:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Cum lacte occidit Muscas in Smolandia.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This is not the only reference to the insecticidal amanita in Linnæus. In his famous <i>Skånske Resa</i> (&#8216;Journey through Scania&#8217;), published in 1751, on page 430, he tells how a certain Swede in Upsala got rid of bedbugs from two of his rooms by the use of the amanita muscaria. He describes the remedy and then concludes with what we consider a most significant statement:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>One takes in the autumn fresh specimens of the fly amanita, pounds them with a pestle quite small in a <a name="jar-3">jar</a>, lets them stand well closed until they become <a name="slime-8">slimy</a> or like gruel. Then one takes a feather or brush and smears all the cracks and corners where they [the bedbugs] keep themselves, and this procedure is repeated several times at monthly intervals. The room stinks for two or three days, but then the smell disappears. These nasty creatures die of it as if the plague had come amidst them, and whole bug-families perish as if from the Black Death. Although this remedy is simple, it is surer than anything else hitherto invented, and with its aid several houses in Upsala have now become free of bugs.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>In a note on the next page Linnæus adds that he has learned of this method for the first time from a Mr. Bern, Cashier of Interests in Upsala. The text is in Swedish.</p>

            <p>For us the striking thing about this description is that it is a report on a novelty. Certain families of Upsala were putting the popular reputation of the fly amanita to a test, and their first impression was enthusiastic. Why had they not been using it for centuries? What were their final conclusions, say five years later? The answers to these questions are not vouchsafed to us.</p>

            <p>After Linnæus the references to the fly-killing potency of the fly amanita in mushroomic writings are innumerable. All the mycologists believe in it &#8212;&#8203; with one dissenting voice. None puts it to a test &#8212;&#8203; with one exception. The French mycologist Jean Baptiste Bulliard, in his <i>Histoire des Plantes Vénéneuses et Suspectes de la France</i>, which he finished in 1779, dares to strike a sceptical note. Speaking of the fly amanita, he says:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p> I have never noticed that it kills flies, as several authors assert. I have had specimens, raw and cooked, for long periods in my apartment. Flies light on them, and seem even to eat them, without bad effects. But I intend to repeat this experiment with certain new precautions.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>We know not the results of the promised experiments, but we know that when Bulliard died in 1793, he held the view that a new scientific name should be bestowed on the amanita muscaria, and he suggested &#8216;agaricus pseudo-aurantiacus,&#8217; presumably because he considered the old name false. The mycological world has not deferred to his wishes, nor even tested his premises.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><a name="bug-complex"><span class="initial-small">B</span>ugs</a>, flies, <a name="moth-1">moths</a>, and all kinds of larvæ &#8212;&#8203; in short, the insect world &#8212;&#8203; constituted for our ancestors until recent times an order of nature instinct with supernatural powers, mostly malevolent and always awesome. Their strange shapes and stranger behavior, their incredible numbers and countless kinds, perhaps most of all their undeniable faculty of metamorphosis, may be at the root of this role that they played in the thinking of untutored mankind. The fly was demonic, and we believe that the &#8216;fly-fungus&#8217; originally meant the demonic mushroom, a name that fittingly designated a mushroom with the virtue of causing inebriation. We believe that the insecticidal meaning has encroached upon the ancient and primary sense, and finally shut it out.</p>

            <p>We know that bugs and flies were linked with supernatural spirits a long time ago. The dung beetle or scarab played a conspicuous part in the religion of the ancient Egyptians. The neighbors of the Israelites in the Old Testament worshipped <a name="beelzebub-1">Beelzebub</a>, whose name meant the Lord of Flies. In the Greek New Testament, where that heathen god does not appear, the same name was used as a synonym for the Prince of Demons. The Biblical term crops out in modern literature, as in line 1334 of Goethe&#8217;s <i>Faust:</i> Wenn man Euch Fliegengott, Verderber, Lügner heisst&#8230; &#8220;When one calls you Fly-god, Destroyer, Liar.&#8221; In Nordic mythology the god Loki assumes the appearance of a &#8216;fly&#8217; to enter the tightly closed apartment of the sleeping goddess Freya. He pricks her, and when she starts, deftly detaches her necklace and steals it. Whatever that &#8216;fly&#8217; was, no one thought of it as a housefly, for the housefly does not bite.</p>

            <p>In English the word &#8216;bug&#8217; until the 17<sup>th</sup> century meant an evil spirit. Then, when that meaning fell from grace in good society, the word came to designate a creeping insect of the beetle class. Its etymology is unknown. It is current in Welsh in both meanings, in the simple form <i>bwg</i> and in compounds. It seems to correspond to Cornish <i>bucca</i> and to Irish <i>bocán</i>, both meaning hobgoblin. We suggest that all these words are related to Anglo-Saxon <i>būc</i>, meaning &#8216;<a name="belly-5">belly</a>&#8217;. The semantic link between inflatable sacs and demonic spirits would parallel the same double layer of meanings in our <i>pogge</i>-cluster of words. The &#8216;Bugge&#8217; that in Shakespere&#8217;s <i>Henry VI Part III</i> &#8216;fear&#8217;d [ = frightened ] us all&#8217; would stand revealed as an uncouth relative of the nimble Puck in <i>The Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</i>, and in these latter days of the Pooka that bathes the stage with benign mischief in Mary Chase&#8217;s <i>Harvey</i>, and of Milne&#8217;s Winnie the Pooh. Ernest Weekley in his <i>Etymological Dictionary of the English Language</i> says that &#8216;bug&#8217; in the supernatural sense is obsolete, except in the compounds &#8216;bugbear&#8217; and &#8216;bugaboo&#8217;, and other lexicographers lean to the same view. Surely they are mistaken: the tabu that hangs over words in low and colloquial use sometimes shuts off the minds of scholars from rich evidence. Few words are so dynamic and versatile as this one is in the United States. Besides bugbear and bugaboo, in compounds we have humbug, firebug, jitterbug, and that contemptuous word for an insane asylum, bughouse. There are of course the variants in -o-, &#8212;&#8203; bogey, bogeyman, boggart (in England&#8217;s North Country), possibly bogus, and the verbs to bogle and to boggle. The Oxford Dictionary in one citation offers grounds for supposing that &#8216;buggy&#8217; was a nickname bestowed in the i8th century on a new design of two-wheeled vehicle, presumably because the makers had not yet got rid of the &#8216;bugs&#8217; and the vehicle was insecure. In the United States a Big Bug used to be a common designation for an important person, a madman is &#8216;bugs&#8217; and fit for the bughouse, a newly designed engine is usually full of &#8216;bugs&#8217;, and a specialist in any field is a &#8216;bug&#8217; on the subject. In the course of casual reading in the American press, we pick out repeated uses of &#8216;bug&#8217; that suggest demonic inspiration. From the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> on March 10, 1951, we learn that all Dixie is bitten by the basketball bug. On March 15 of the same year the <i>New York World-Telegram and Sun</i> launches a drive for circulation with a &#8216;Bugs Bunny Coloring Contest&#8217;, the &#8216;bugs&#8217; in question being demonic imps and not insects. On May 8, 1953, <i>The New York Times</i> in its &#8216;Topics&#8217; says that Vice President Nixon has been bitten by a golf bug. On the same date the afternoon newspaper reports that the Allies seek to clear up the &#8216;bugs&#8217; in the truce terms in Korea. On May 17, we learn in a book review in <i>The New York Times</i> that the defeated United Nations troops in Korea, when they were falling back as best they could in late 1950, referred to their retreat as &#8216;bugging out&#8217;, a term that suggested both devilish resourcefulness and the goddess Luck. On July 14 the <i>Daily News</i> of New York reported in big headlines that the &#8216;boat bug bites thousands&#8217;, meaning that summer throngs seek to go boating. The idea of distension is dominant in the vulgar American verb &#8216;to bug out&#8217;, meaning &#8216;to bulge&#8217;. Tennessee Williams in his short story, &#8216;Three Players of a Summer Game&#8217;, has one of his characters say: &#8220;I walked straight up to them both, and you should of seen the eyes of them both bug out!&#8221;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn8" id="cp5b13-r8">[8]</a></sup> If we are right, in this vulgarism the word preserves its pristine meaning, today largely superseded by a specific and secondary application to tiny, crawling vermin. On the campus of Wayne University, in Detroit, &#8216;buggy&#8217; has been reported in recent years as a students&#8217; word for &#8216;upset&#8217; or &#8216;mentally disturbed&#8217;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn9" id="cp5b13-r9">[9]</a></sup></p>

            <p>It is easy to see how Bugg came to be an English family name, for it enjoys to this day a vigorous existence, with an -s attached, as a respected nickname; e.g., Bugs Raymond the once mighty baseball <a name="pitcher-3">pitcher</a>, Bugs Baer the beloved cartoonist and Hearst writer, and Bugsy Siegel, the gangster who died a sudden and violent death in surroundings of gaudy splendor. In June 1941 Charles Workman, known as &#8216;the Bug&#8217;, stood trial in the New Jersey Court of Common Pleas for the murder of Arthur (Dutch Schultz) Flegenheimer. When one of the Bug&#8217;s witnesses reversed his own testimony, the defendant changed his plea from not guilty to non vult, and thereby avoided the death penalty but bowed to an inevitable life sentence. In the course of that trial one of the off-stage figures was Martin (Buggsy) Goldstein.</p>

            <p>Let it be noted that in the minds of those who bestow these bug-inspired nicknames, they are titles in which affection, awe, and envy are mixed. They are an expression of deference toward the ingenious demons that possess the honored person. Let it be further noted that current usage inclines toward a plural visitation of imps, though in the case of Bugs Baer we can testify that in his immediate circle he like Charles Workman is often simply &#8216;the Bug&#8217;.</p>

            <p>&#8217;Bug&#8217; also turns up in place-names, as in Bugtussle, in Cullman County, Alabama. Curious about the origin of such a name, we addressed our inquiry to a citizen in nearby Bremen, whose reply deserves preservation:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Some forty years ago we had a postoffice here:
                Wilburn. Two drunks were fighting, Will James and
                Charles Campbell. James called it Bugtussle. So it has
                been called Bugtussle by a part of the people ever
                since that time. 12-20-49.</p>
                <p class="pull-right">[Signed] G. C. Florence.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>May Bugtussle forever remain faithful to a name born in Homeric circumstances, commemorating the spot where once strove together the two Big Bugs. In England we find a Buglawton in Cheshire and a Bugthorpe in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and Eilert Ekwall in his dictionary of English place-names permits us to associate these towns with our &#8216;bug&#8217; of supernatural powers. &#8216;Bug&#8217; displays a singular aptitude in America for assuming new meanings derived from its original sense, a power of verbal metamorphosis that befits the world of six-legged creatures. Take telegraphy, for example. In the early days of the telegraph, the transmitting key worked perpendicularly, and the telegrapher had to lower and release his hand for every dot and every dash. Later, perhaps half a century ago, a device appeared that permitted much faster manual transmission. The new key worked horizontally, to left and to right of a neutral position, making dots continuously as long as it was pressed to one side. The hand no longer moved for each dot, but only when dots changed to dashes. The thing seemed possessed of the devil, it went so fast, and everyone in the craft was soon calling it the &#8216;bug&#8217;.</p>

            <p>With the verb &#8216;to bugger&#8217; a double problem presents itself. The meaning that is written into the criminal law comes from the French <i>bougre</i>, and seems to have emerged at the time of the Albigensian heresy in referring to the perverted practices attributed, unjustly, to the devotees of that sect. But throughout the English-speaking world there has always been an innocent use, as when the sailor says of his gear that it is all buggered up<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn10" id="cp5b13-r10">[10]</a></sup>, and when a Lancashireman pays another the compliment of calling him a &#8216;rare old bugger&#8217;. In circles where an improper word is excluded, this verb has nourished down to our own times. We suggest that this innocent use offers us a verbal form derived from &#8216;bug&#8217; as a sprite, that it is native in English, and that the younger word imported from France has led until recently a segregated existence. Today the bad word, becoming more widely known, is driving out the good (as Gresham says), to the detriment of the language. For education as it spreads breeds new misunderstandings and new ignorances.</p>

            <p>In an English translation of the Bible that bears the date 1549, it was possible for pious scholars to render Psalm xci: 5 thus:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>&#8230; thou shalt not need to be afrayed for any bugges by night nor for the arrowe that flyeth by daye;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>a verse that emerges cleansed in the Authorized Version:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow
                    that flieth by day.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>&#8217;Bug&#8217; in the sense of a creeping, six-legged creature is first recorded early in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, but it may have been long in use on the tongues of the untutored people who made up most of the population of England. Are we dealing here with two words or one? The Oxford Dictionary reserved judgment on this nice point, but in a study of the word published in December 1935 and 1936 in the <i>PMLA</i> (the journal of the Modern Language Association of America), Miss Hope Emily Allen established beyond reasonable doubt that the two meanings belong to a single word. The six-legged beetle was felt to be the habitation of a demon, and took his name. The Oxford Dictionary reveals a parallel association of ideas in the word &#8216;fly&#8217;, for this word not only refers to insects but also has always meant a &#8216;familiar spirit&#8217;, a usage that survives to this day in the adjective &#8216;fly&#8217;, rated as slang by some, meaning nimble, dexterous, sharp.</p>

            <p>In the Russian language there is an astonishing parallel for the two meanings of these English words. Children in Muscovy are admonished to behave lest the <i>buka</i> get them. The <i>buka</i> is the children&#8217;s bugbear. The <i>bukashka</i> is any small flying buzzing beetle. Slavists consider that the two words are related to each other, and that both are keyed to the basic word <i>byk</i>, &#8216;bull&#8217;. Until a thorough study of the demonic vocabulary of Northern Europe has been made, perhaps the door should be left open for alternative possibilities.</p>

            <p>When Albertus Magnus and Valerius Cordus referred in Latin and German to the &#8216;flies&#8217; killed by the fly amanita, what insect had they in mind? What meanings and associations did the words possess for them? Today &#8216;fly&#8217; means the housefly, or, by extension, other species of two-winged insects. But this is a modern concentration of the meaning, the result of increasingly precise observations in the insect world. The Oxford Dictionary establishes the fact that in former times &#8216;fly&#8217; ordinarily designated insects as divergent as locusts, moths, gnats, and the whole dipterous order. To this day there are High German dialects in which <i>Fliege</i> and <i>Mücke</i> mean both &#8216;fly&#8217; and &#8216;mosquito&#8217;, as does the word <i>mich</i> in Frisian. The older usage survives in the angler&#8217;s &#8216;flies&#8217;, which descend from all kinds of flying insects. In the Indian and Iranian languages the words for &#8216;fly&#8217; are often used for &#8216;bee&#8217; or are the base from which their words for &#8216;bee&#8217; are formed.</p>

            <p>Good illustrations of this early generic usage are to be found in Basque, where the primitive form of the word &#8216;fly&#8217; was <i>uli.</i> In a variety of forms this word enters into the names of many insects: <i>eltxo</i>, mosquito; <i>uli farfalla</i>, butterfly; <i>eltzar</i>, caterpillar; <i>eltxu</i>, locust; and, perhaps the most interesting of all, a word used by the Basques of Guipuzcoa, <i>eultza</i>, meaning a bee-hive, the second syllable being simply a collective suffix. A bee-hive is a &#8216;fly-hive&#8217;, and in the dialect of Bermeo in the same province, a wasp is an <i>ulabio</i>, the first element meaning &#8216;fly&#8217; and the second being derived from the Romance word for &#8216;bee&#8217;, <i>abeille</i> and <i>abeja</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn11" id="cp5b13-r11">[11]</a></sup></p>

            <p>The variable application of the words for &#8216;fly&#8217; in former times was not a conscious use of a general term. It is to be explained rather by the ordinary man&#8217;s inability to distinguish among flying insects, so that he was disposed to use without precision such words as he possessed for the insect world. This was common to the period, and therefore to all languages. The ordinary syrphus or carrion fly was considered for thousands of years to be the same as the honey bee and bore the same name: this is the insect that Samson found swarming in the carcass of a lion. The fact of metamorphosis in the insect world was known, and <a name="maggots">maggots</a> and other carrion worms were known to be kin to the insect world, but the successive transformations were not carefully distinguished by species. In Dutch the word for &#8216;<a name="moth-2">moth</a>&#8217;, which is <i>mot</i>, serves for maggots also. Sometimes accidents of sound led to confusions in names. In English &#8216;flea&#8217; and &#8216;fly&#8217; are words of different origins, but the phonetic similarity caused them to be used interchangeably. In <i>Henry V</i> we learn that when Falstaff lay dying, he saw a &#8216;Flea&#8217; stick upon the toper Bardolph&#8217;s flaming nose, whereupon he said it was a &#8216;blacke Soule burning in Hell&#8217;. What he saw was of course a fly, and the black soul in hell was, according to the beliefs of that day, its incorporeal counterpart, the Demon domiciled in every fly.</p>

            <p>For all insects used to be considered agents of demonic powers and were clothed in a fearsome aura of mystery and magic. We believe we can adduce new and striking evidence of this. On an earlier page we pointed out that Satan was known in France at one time as <i>le Bot</i>, &#8216;the Cripple&#8217;; and that this name came to be transferred to the toad, and in the form <i>bot volant</i> to the <a name="nightjar">nightjar</a> and the bat, nocturnal flying creatures of evil omen. We suggested that the form of the English word &#8216;bat&#8217; is attributable to the French word, but we did not then point out the wider applications in English of the French word. &#8216;Bot&#8217; in English is the larva of the gadfly; it occurs also in &#8216;botfly&#8217;. What was originally a euphemism for Satan himself thus turns up in English as a word of the insect world. Satan resides in the botfly and in the larva of the gadfly. In Joseph Wright&#8217;s <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i> we find that &#8216;bot&#8217; and &#8216;bat&#8217; are dialectal variants of each other, and that in various parts of the United Kingdom &#8216;bat&#8217; is used for &#8216;moth&#8217;. (The larger moths, nocturnal in habit, were formerly &#8216;flies&#8217; of specially evil potency.) In many counties of England &#8216;bot&#8217; has been used colloquially for all kinds of grubs and larvas, even turning up in Wright&#8217;s pages as a designation for the flying &#8216;bat&#8217;. The dictionaries declare that the origin of&#8217;bot&#8217; is unknown; we think they have overlooked the multivalent service rendered by the French <i>bot</i> and failed to detect the common Satanic denominator between it and the English term.</p>

            <p>The word &#8216;maggot&#8217;, in turn, besides designating larvæ, has always meant an evil caprice. John O&#8217;Donnell in the New York <i>Daily News</i> on October 28, 1952, devoted his column to &#8216;Mr. Truman&#8217;s Maggot&#8217;, by which he meant &#8220;a maggotty individual full of whims&#8221;, and the use of the word in this sense is richly documented in the Oxford Dictionary. In Smollett&#8217;s <i>The Reprisal</i>; or, <i>The Tars of Old England</i> one of the characters says that &#8220;now we man [must] &#8230; defend her from the maggots of this daft Frenchman&#8221;, who had been &#8220;sent awa&#8217; with a flea [sic] in his bonnet&#8221;. The etymology of &#8216;maggot&#8217; is unknown, according to the dictionaries. But if we view this word against the background of double meanings that it and &#8216;bot&#8217;, &#8216;fly&#8217;, and &#8216;bee&#8217; carry, the likelihood presents itself that &#8216;maggot&#8217; (which was spelled &#8216;magot&#8217; in its first recorded appearance around the year 1400) is related to &#8216;magic&#8217;, and both are then to be explained as derived, via French, from the Necromancers known as the Magi. When the Flemings and Dutch in former times called mushrooms the devil&#8217;s bread, they must have had in mind the demonic larvae, maggots, and &#8216;flies&#8217; that batten on the flesh of many wild fungi.</p>

            <p>In the Middle Ages delirium, drunkenness, and insanity were attributed to insects that were loose inside the head of the victim. This belief, strange for the modern mind, survives in many familiar locutions. A man has a bee in his bonnet, a fly (or bug) in his ear, or demonic <a name="bat-3">bats</a> (= &#8216;bots&#8217;) in his belfry. The Norwegians get flies into their heads or put flies into others&#8217; heads. To &#8216;put a bee on someone&#8217; means to fix him willy nilly for a given purpose: in this locution the demonic intent is scarcely fossilized. It used to be said in French, when a man was getting excited, that &#8216;la mouche lui monte à la tête&#8217;, a fly is getting up into his head. Down to recent times <i>avaler les mouches</i> was a phrase for saying that someone had summoned up his courage, and the flies thus swallowed were of course demonic. Rabelais at the very end of Book IV makes the coward Panurge protest that, far from being afraid, he is braver than if he had eaten all the flies cooked in the pastries of Paris betwixt St. John&#8217;s Day and All Saints&#8217;.There is a colloquial expression that circulates around Lyons and perhaps elsewhere: &#8216;Ne prends pas la mouche&#8217;: don&#8217;t catch a fly, don&#8217;t get excited. Of a man who is unbalanced one says, &#8216;Il a l&#8217;araignée dans le plafond&#8217;, he has a spider in his ceiling, i.e., in his upper story. The Czechs use an identical phrase: <i>miti mouchu</i> (or <i>pavouka</i>) <i>na mozku</i>, &#8216;to have a fly (or spider) on the brain&#8217;. In Russian, we say of a man who is tipsy: <i>on c mnkhoj</i>, so-and-so is &#8216;with fly&#8217;. There is a gesture peculiar to the Russians that we feel sure stems from this association of psychic possession with flying insects. The Russian when he suggests having an alcocholic drink is like as not to perform a fillip against his neck below the ear: this is so habitual that it is become a Pavlov reflex. Does not that familiar fillip invoke the demonic &#8216;fly&#8217; entering the mind? According to the Icelandic-English lexicon of Cleasby-Vigfusson, under <i>fluga</i>, in Icelandic belief sorcerers would bewitch flies and send them to kill their enemies. This explains the modern Icelandic phrases, &#8216;to swallow the fly&#8217; or &#8216;to carry the fly&#8217;, meaning &#8216;to be the tool of another man in a wicked business&#8217;. In Basque folklore, sorcerers and other malevolent beings would work their will through demons that assumed the shape of flies, and sorcerers would carry the demonic creatures in a sheath such as anglers use for their flies today. In America little children to this day sing a nonsense ditty that invokes the &#8216;bug&#8217; of demonic possession:</p>

            <blockquote>
                It&#8217;s raining, it&#8217;s pouring,<br/>
                The old man is snoring,<br/>
                He went to bed<br/>
                With a bug in his head,<br/>
                And didn&#8217;t get up until morning.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Hieronymus Bosch, the greatest of Europe&#8217;s painters of the demonic world, presents us with a superb illustration of flies in their demonic rôle. We find it in the left hand panel of the <i>Hay Wain</i>, where the momentous events that took place in Paradise leading up to Man&#8217;s First Fall are portrayed with moving beauty. We reproduce the upper portion of that panel, wherein the observer sees that the angels tumbling down from Heaven assume the form of &#8216;flies&#8217; &#8212;&#8203; a diverse lot of winged demons, <a name="beelzebub-2">Beelzebub</a>&#8217;s host. The old meaning is far from dead even today. Recently <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> published a poem by H. S. Mackintosh containing these sprightly lines:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Has Freud not hit the Devil on the snout?<br />
                    Is not Beelzebub destroyed by Flit?<br />
                    Are we important? Do we really sprout<br />
                    Immortal souls that priests may manumit?</p>

            <p>Perhaps the reader will perceive the direction in which our argument is heading. We have seen on an earlier page that when the French refer to the amanita muscaria as the <i>crapaudin</i>, this by way of the Old French word for toad, <i>bot</i>, means the demonic mushroom. It is a word unrelated to insecticidal uses. In English that demonic word <i>bot</i> is transferred to the insect world, and shares with &#8216;maggot&#8217;, &#8216;bee&#8217;, and &#8216;fly&#8217; the idea of demonic possession. When we find the <i>crapaudin</i> called the <i>Fliegenschwamm</i> in German, we sense a semantic identity. Both words are singularly appropriate for the inebriating mushroom, and they inform us that long ago, much earlier even than Albertus Magnus, the secret of this mushroom was known. And if it was known, why should it not, on appropriate occasions, have been put to its own great, even fearsome, use.</p>

            <p>One of the most interesting examples of the Satanic fly in European literature is to be found in that classic of the Danish stage, Ludvig Holberg&#8217;s <i>Jeppe of the Hill</i>, first produced in 1722. Two physicians are conversing. One of them speaks of his Lordship, who has had a strange, ugly dream, which so excited him that he imagines himself a peasant. Whereupon the other physician recalls a remarkable case ten years back: &#8220;&#8230; a man who thought his head was full of flies. He could not rid himself of the delusion, until a most clever doctor cured him in the following manner. He covered his patient&#8217;s whole head with a plaster in which he had embedded masses of dead flies. [Query: were they the Spanish flies of the Pharmacopœia?] After a while he removed the plaster and showed the flies to the patient, who naturally believed that they had been drawn from his own head and therefore concluded that he was cured.&#8221; Here is a beautiful instance of the way a dramatist (or physician) puts to use an outworn belief that lingers on in the penumbra of man&#8217;s consciousness.</p>

            <p>Old and forgotten beliefs often survive in strange places, in usages that on their face are baffling. Miss Allen has pointed out that in the nursery language of little children, the homely words used for dried or inspissated nasal <a name="mucus-3">mucus</a>, such as &#8216;buggy bear&#8217; and &#8216;bug&#8217;, are linked with the spirit world. In Russian the corresponding word is <i>kozjavka</i>, which means larva or any small creeping thing. There is an expression, <i>vsjakaja kozjavka lezet v bukashki</i> &#8212;&#8203; &#8216;every larva would be a fly&#8217;; and <i>bukashka</i> is a diminutive of <i>buka</i>, bugbear. We believe that these nursery words for dried nasal mucus are a legacy of the medieval belief that when sanity returns to a man who has been out of his mind, an observant attendant can catch sight of an insect emerging from the nostril of the patient. Thus that escaping bug or maggot or bot or fly survives to this day in a metaphor on the tongues of unknowing children. We should add that this interpretation is ours, and not Miss Allen&#8217;s.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn12" id="cp5b13-r12">[12]</a></sup></p>

            <p>This belief in the demonic rôle of flying and creeping insects is not confined to Europe and the Mediterranean. We think we find telling evidence in favor of our argument in that the area of diffusion of this belief embraces the Chukchees and Korjaks, the very peoples where the use of the fly amanita survives. Jochelson in his treatise on the Korjaks reports that if the eater of the fly amanita vomits, the people believe that the spirits of the demonic mushroom can be found in the vomit as &#8216;worms&#8217; which then quickly vanish into the earth.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn13" id="cp5b13-r13">[13]</a></sup> Bogoras in his study of the Chukchees says that the shamans think psychic disturbances are caused by insects, and they use insects in their treatment of mental disorders. The shaman catches an insect from off his drum, swallows it, spits it up, and applies it to the head of the victim; he then sucks the sick man&#8217;s head. Sometimes the insect is imaginary, sometimes real.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn14" id="cp5b13-r14">[14]</a></sup></p>

            <p>It befits the amanita muscaria, with its unique prestige among country-folk as the villain of the fungal world, that the pattern of vernacular names for it should be correspondingly subtle. Over large areas it is the mushroom with &#8216;flies&#8217; in its cap. In France it is the domicile of the <i>bot</i> or toad, by which is meant Satan; and in the Basque <i><a name="amoroto-3">amoroto</a></i> we find the same presence. This raises the question whether the English &#8216;<a name="toadstool-14">toadstool</a>&#8217; was not once the specific name of the fly amanita, just as in the Haute Saône Eugène Rolland reports <i><a name="bo-2">bò</a></i> as a designation for any gilled fungus, and in the Loire, <i><a name="botet-2">botet</a></i>, both presumably meaning, by way of &#8216;toad&#8217;, the Satanic fungus. We have said before that Rolland reports <i>tuo-mouscos</i>, &#8216;fly-killer&#8217;, in the Aude, and there this name, significantly, competes with another, <i>mijoulo folho</i>, the &#8216;mad-mushroom&#8217;, as though the two were synonyms. The idea of madness is reported in several other common names for the fly amanita: <i>mujolo folo</i> around Toulouse, <i>coucourlo fouolo</i> in the Aveyron, and <i><a name="oriol-foll">oriol foll</a></i> in Catalan, &#8216;mad oriole&#8217;, the oriole being the amanita cæsarea. In the dialect of Fribourg, Switzerland, the amanita muscaria is the &#8216;devil&#8217;s hat&#8217;, <i>tsapí de diåblhou.</i> In all this nomenclature the toad and the fly are synonyms and complementary, and both mean madness and Satanic possession.</p>

            <p>On a later page we shall discuss the small group of painters, mostly Dutch, who devoted their talents in the 17<sup>th</sup> century to still-life studies of demonological subjects. These painters, superb technicians, have seldom been surpassed in their solicitude for portraying nature faithfully. They assembled their curious compositions, not capriciously, but to express folk-beliefs that were already waning, and therefore their canvases offer us folkloric documentation of high value. So far as we know, this aspect of their art has not yet been studied. We reproduce one of these paintings, a canvas by Otto Marseus van Schrieck, which hangs today in the Bâle art museum. The composition is admirably handled. In a small field there are more than twenty mushrooms, most of them identifiable. Dominating the center of the scene is the latticed fungus known as the clathrus cancellatus, here slightly constrained to suggest a death&#8217;s head. On the extreme right is one of the coprini, caught in its moment of active deliquescence. There is a grass <a name="snake-5">snake</a> (natrix natrix), a green or wall lizard of the lacerta genus, and a gecko not native to the Netherlands. The snake is about to seize a beetle. A dragon fly with a pronounced curvature approaches the large mushroom that seems to be a stropharia semiglobata. Of highest interest for us is the &#8216;fly&#8217; that descends on the amanita. The Bâle museum calls this insect a butterfly (<i>Schmetterling</i>), but this is an error. It is a moth, the most sinister of the &#8216;flies&#8217;, and the painter was so intent on an accurate statement of his message that he permits us to identify the moth as belonging to the family called saturnine, i.e., one of the saturniidæ. Thus here in this nocturnal gathering heavy with demonic import we discover a &#8216;fly&#8217;, &#8212;&#8203; the &#8216;fly&#8217; that gives its name to the fly amanita, a &#8216;fly&#8217; that for our ancestors was saturated with magical potency. Missing from the scene are the amphibia: neither toad nor frog do we see. Van Schrieck knew the virtue of economy in utterance, and the omission of the toad was for him obligatory. In the presence of the &#8216;fly&#8217;, the <i>padde</i> or <i>bot</i> would have been redundant, iconographically otiose, an intruder speaking the same message but in a different idiom. Its presence would mean piling not Pelion on Ossa, but <i><a name="paddestoel-3">paddestoel</a></i> on <i><a name="vliegenzwam">vliegenzwam</a></i>. The fly amanita holds an altogether extraordinary place in the folk culture of northern and eastern Europe. The deadly fungi are as nothing in comparison, and in the mycophobic world of the Germanic peoples no edible kind was of importance until recent times. For us it is altogether incredible that the grip of this <i>Fliegenschwamm</i> on the imaginations of countless generations sprang from any insecticidal power that it may have. It possessed in men&#8217;s minds a supernatural potency, the potency of the &#8216;flies&#8217;, and though direct, affirmative testimony is meager, we believe that the prestige of the fly amanita descended from a knowledge, in at least some circles at some period, of its divine or demonic powers.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">U</span>p to this point our argument about the fly amanita has been an intellectual exercise. We have offered an alternative explanation for the name. We have impugned the traditional explanation by challenging the credibility of the witnesses. Albertus Magnus and Von Megenberg were relying on hearsay, and so indeed was Linnaeus when he quoted a Mr. Bern about the bedbugs. Most writers place the fly-killing use at a distance from themselves in time or space, Clusius in Frankfort, Linnaeus in Smolandia, John Ramsbottom in Poland, Bohemia, and Rumania. Mr. Ramsbottom<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn15" id="cp5b13-r15">[14]</a></sup> also says that the fly amanita was &#8216;formerly&#8217; used in England and Sweden for killing bedbugs, and thus he justifies the occasional occurrence of the name &#8216;bug agaric&#8217;. But this term can not be really old, for Linnaeus by his great authority imposed the name &#8216;agaric&#8217; on the gilled fungi and the use of &#8216;bug&#8217; for &#8216;bedbug&#8217; appears to be a modernism, whereas &#8216;fly&#8217; and &#8216;bug&#8217; in their demonic sense are truly old. Only Bulliard put the fly amanita to the test, and his findings seem to have been cleanly negative. But in support of Bulliard&#8217;s scepticism we can add a story told to us by a Russian friend, Ekaterina Apollinarievna Bouteneff. Her nurse in childhood was an un-lettered peasant woman from the region of Riazan. Our friend remembers having seen this good woman time and again put out a saucer with a crushed cap of the fly amanita in it, a lump of sugar on top of the fungal mess. This was going to kill the flies, she would always say. But our friend always observed that the flies did not die. When she would ask her nurse why they did not die, the reply was always the same: "They are sure to die later."</p>

            <p>In the summer of 1953, on our suggestion, the mycologist F.-E. Eckblad of the Botanical Museum in Oslo, working under Professor Nordhagen, undertook the experiments that were a desideratum for our case. In a letter addressed to us on September 8 he sent us his preliminary conclusions. They, like Bulliard&#8217;s, were negative: &#8220;The fly amanita may contain matters poisonous to flies. But flies are not attracted to it, perhaps avoid it, and are not killed by it when used in the old way&#8221; , i.e., mixed with sugar or milk or both. Mr. Eckblad warns that his findings must be considered tentative, both because his supply of the mushrooms had not been so plentiful as he had hoped and because several species of flies were present in insufficient numbers. But on the strength of the first season&#8217;s experiments there was no evidence of insecticidal virtue in the fly amanita. On the other hand, experiments carried out during the same season at the Laboratoire de Cryptogamie of the Muséum National d&#8217;Histoire Naturelle in Paris gave different results: the flies were drawn to the concoction and died from it, and they died more quickly when the milk was sweetened with sugar. Once again the evidence leaves us in suspense, and the experiment calls for retrial by various workers.</p>

            <p>Even if the fly amanita kills flies, our conclusions will not be invalidated, for the name could carry two layers of meaning, one for housewives and the other for those initiated in sacred mysteries.</p>

            <p>However, if it should develop that the fly amanita never harmed a fly, we should find ourselves confronted with a new question: how do we explain the legend? Why did Albertus Magnus give it the endorsement of his immense renown? Why is the <i>Fliegenschwamm</i> called &#8216;fly-killer&#8217; throughout the Slavic world and by the peasants in certain provinces of France?</p>

            <p>Let us assume for the purposes of our argument that we are right, and that the fly amanita was really the &#8216;demonic fungus&#8217; of northern Europe for untold centuries of unrecorded history. Let us suppose that it was utilized for its inebriating virtue. Such use was certainly veiled in awe and mystery, and the secret was the precious possession of esoteric and (need we add?) illiterate circles. As the missionaries of Mediterranean culture and religion probed the northern forests and gained adherents, the custodians of the old culture, retreating before the new, would guard ever more zealously the lore that was their exclusive possession and that survived solely by oral transmission from generation to generation. From earliest times, in the pagan era, an alternative explanation for Fliegenschwamm must have been a convenience in satisfying the curiosity of the laity, and this popular rationalization was all that reached the ears of bookworms like Albertus Magnus. The use of the fly amanita as an inebriant may always have been reserved for rare occasions.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b13-fn16" id="cp5b13-r16">[16]</a></sup></p>

            <p>Students of cultural history must ever keep in mind the fact, abundantly established, that in a single population, living together contemporaneously, distinct cultures can co-exist largely insulated from each other, like the droplets in an emulsion, juxtaposed but never mingling. Albertus Magnus, though German-born, was culturally a child of the Mediterranean. The universal knowledge of which he was repository and teacher was the legacy of classic antiquity and the Church. He and his like rejected the old culture and were certainly not privy to its innermost secrets, whatever they were. In the end the churchmen conquered, of course, and the contents of the modern mind are the fruit of the cultural invasion of northern Europe by such missionaries as he. The nether face of northern Europe before the advent of the alphabet and the printing press, the autochthonous culture, is known to us imperfectly, in fragments. By the time of the witchcraft trials in the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries, the distillation process was common property throughout northern and eastern Europe, and aqua vitcz, costing almost nothing, had certainly swept away and obliterated any surviving use or even memory of the secret virtue of the fly amanita. If the meaning that we have read into Fliegenschwamm should win approval, we still could not assert that when the Vikings went &#8216;berserk&#8217;, the fly amanita was the cause. The debate among Scandinavian scholars would not be settled. But the affirmative argument would be greatly strengthened.</p>
