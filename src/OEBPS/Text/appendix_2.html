        <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Aksakov's 'Remarks and Observations of a Mushroom Hunter'</i></p>

        <p class="calibre1">THE following essay, by Sergej Timofeevich Aksakov, appeared in 1856in the <i class="calibre4">Vestnik</i></p>

        <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Estestvennykh Nauk,</i> the publication of a group of nature students who constituted the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">Moscow Imperial Society. Aksakov was a Russian country squire whose <i class="calibre4">Memoirs</i> are</p>

        <p class="calibre1">classics of Russian literature, valued alike for their honest and detailed picture of daily life</p>

        <p class="calibre1">in a by-gone world and for the lovable self-portrait that their author unconsciously</p>

        <p class="calibre1">paints. His forgotten paper on mushrooms possesses in rich measure the virtues that made</p>

        <p class="calibre1">his major works famous, and in translating it we have tried our best to preserve the flavor</p>

        <p class="calibre1">of the original. On its first appearance nearly a century ago, the editor, K. F. Rouille,</p>

        <p class="calibre1">drew attention to what would be called today its ecological implications, which he referred</p>

        <p class="calibre1">to as nature's 'law of interrelations'. Specifically, Aksakov, though only an amateur,</p>

        <p class="calibre1">seems to have been precocious in insisting on a biological tie between certain fungi and</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the roots of some kinds of trees. The peasants in the Slavic lands from time immemorial</p>

        <p class="calibre1">and recently the mycologists of the West had observed that some mushroom species are</p>

        <p class="calibre1">always found close to certain kinds of trees, but not until 1885 did A. B. Frank publish in</p>

        <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Berichte der Deutschen Botanischen Gesellschaft</i> the notable paper on truffles that securely</p>

        <p class="calibre1">established the symbiotic kinship between trees and fungi - a relationship that came to be</p>

        <p class="calibre1">known as mycorrhiza. Apparently Aksakov's further observations concerning a difference</p>

        <p class="calibre1">in the growth of mushrooms on various sides of a given tree, according to the compass</p>

        <p class="calibre1">points, are unknown to mycologists. Was the behavior that he remarked peculiar to the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">trees in his grove, or was he calling attention to a significant phenomenon that others have</p>

        <p class="calibre1">overlooked to this day; . . . Here is Aksakov's essay.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">Among the sorts of hunting in which men engage, place must be made for the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">peaceful quest of mushrooms, or 'mushroom-taking'. This cannot compare with</p>

        <p class="calibre1">other kinds of hunting that are more lively because they involve the animal world,</p>

        <p class="calibre1">but it can hold its own among many so-called secondary hunts, each of which</p>

        <p class="calibre1">offers its own interest. I give preference to mushroom-hunting because you must</p>

        <p class="calibre1">look for mushrooms and it follows that you may not find them. There is needed</p>

        <p class="calibre1">in addition a certain skill - knowledge about where mushrooms grow, familiarity</p>

        <p class="calibre1">with the terrain - and luck! No wonder that the proverb says, "With luck even</p>

        <p class="calibre1">mushroom-hunting is good."' In mushroom-hunting there are elements of the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">unknown, the unexpected; there is success and there is failure. These are the things</p>

        <p class="calibre1">that incite a man to the pursuit and give to it a special interest. The gathering</p>

        <p class="calibre1">of berries or nuts, also a hunt of the second class, at first glance might resemble</p>

        <p class="calibre1">mushroom-hunting, but on closer inspection we shall see that the latter pos-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">sesses great advantages. Mushroom hunters will surely share my view, and with</p>

        <p class="calibre1">i. I have heard this proverb in an inverted form: "Without luck it's no use to go mushroom-hunting". S. T. A.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">394</p>

        <p class="calibre1">APPENDIX II</p>

        <p class="calibre1">them I wish to have a chat and tell them of my observations over many years.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">Mushrooms are the most nourishing, tasty, and wholesome food, if they are</p>

        <p class="calibre1">not eaten to excess nor smothered in too much fat, but perfectly fried or boiled</p>

        <p class="calibre1">or thoroughly pickled in brine. Pickling in brine is employed with those mush-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">rooms that are conserved in the raw state, such as those of the lactarius and russula</p>

        <p class="calibre1">families and others. For city folk mushrooms are a delicacy; to the country</p>

        <p class="calibre1">people they are food and in some regions a source of income. The mushroom</p>

        <p class="calibre1">is a child of the forest.1 The steppe has no mushrooms except the common field</p>

        <p class="calibre1">mushrooms and the <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">lugoviki</b></i> [marasmius oreades], and even these are born only</p>

        <p class="calibre1">in the fertilized soil of cattle-pens, pastures, and roads, and always close to the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">dwellings of men and cattle. It is known to all that if you raise trees in a bare</p>

        <p class="calibre1">field, either from seed or by transplanting, mushrooms will surely start growing</p>

        <p class="calibre1">there, the kind depending on the kind of trees. But, contrary to the opinion</p>

        <p class="calibre1">of many, the mysterious power of trees to bring forth mushrooms around them-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">selves does not he merely in the shade that is produced by the branches. Shade</p>

        <p class="calibre1">is the first requisite, it is true, but only the first. Shade protects the earth from the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">scorching rays of the sun, produces humidity and even wetness in the soil,</p>

        <p class="calibre1">and this is essential for both the woods and the mushrooms. But their real source,</p>

        <p class="calibre1">it seems to me, lies in the roots of the trees, which humidifying in their turn the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">surrounding earth, impart to it the arboreal sap; and it is in the roots that in my</p>

        <p class="calibre1">opinion lies the key to the mystery of the birth of mushrooms. This is most</p>

        <p class="calibre1">convincingly shown by the fact that around stumps of trees where a certain</p>

        <p class="calibre1">species formerly grew in the life-giving shade, the same kind will continue to</p>

        <p class="calibre1">grow for as long as ten years or more. Roots die slowly. Finally they rot and</p>

        <p class="calibre1">dry, and the mushrooms cease. Many a time I have observed tree stumps standing</p>

        <p class="calibre1">quite far apart in meadows where the influence of neighboring trees could not</p>

        <p class="calibre1">be suspected. As proof of the fact that shade and moisture are not sufficient for</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the growth of mushrooms, one could point to certain species of trees such as</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the alder, black poplar, poplar, and bird-cherry [padus avium], under and near</p>

        <p class="calibre1">which no genuine mushrooms spring up. The complete dependence of mush-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">rooms on the particular sap of a tree firmly establishes the fact that certain trees</p>

        <p class="calibre1">produce only their own kind of mushroom. If only moisture, shade, and cool-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">ness were needed, all kinds of mushrooms would grow under all kinds of trees.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">The country-folk recognize well the influence of trees over mushrooms and</p>

        <p class="calibre1">therefore have given to some of them names associated with trees, such as the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">birch-mushroom, the aspen-mushroom, the hazel-mushroom, the oak-mushroom.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">Mushrooms are divided between the edible and the inedible. The latter are</p>

        <p class="calibre1">I. In Japanese the generic word for mushrooms is <i class="calibre4">kino-ko,</i> 'forest's child". V. P. W.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">395</p>

        <p class="calibre1">APPENDIX II</p>

        <p class="calibre1">generally called <i class="calibre4">poganki,</i> which includes poisonous mushrooms such as the <i class="calibre4">dubovik</i></p>

        <p class="calibre1">['oak-mushroom', boletus luridus], the <i class="calibre4">mukhomor</i> ['fly-killer', amanita muscaria],</p>

        <p class="calibre1">and others. Among the <i class="calibre4">poganki</i> are mushrooms that in some parts of Russia are</p>

        <p class="calibre1">considered poisonous, and elsewhere are considered good for food; for example,</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">svinukhi</b></i> or 'cow's ears' [both names are Aksakov's; a paxillus sp.]; <i class="calibre4">valui</i> [rus-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">sula foetens]; <i class="calibre4">mochjonki</i> ['the sopping ones';]; <i class="calibre4">chernukhi</i> [russula adusta]; etc. In</p>

        <p class="calibre1">order to be eaten without harm, these must be first parboiled or soaked and then</p>

        <p class="calibre1">salted. I even knew one man who, apart from the <i class="calibre4">mukhomor</i> and <i class="calibre4">dubovik,</i> consid-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">ered all mushrooms edible, and as living evidence to support his faith in their inno-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">cence, he had himself and his family to show. He even asserted that the so-called</p>

        <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">poganki</i> were as tasty as other mushrooms. This is hard to believe, because most</p>

        <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">poganki</i> not only have an unpleasant color and appearance, but also smell bad.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">It is worthy of note that many edible or so-called 'good' mushrooms have their</p>

        <p class="calibre1">counterpart in the <i class="calibre4">poganki,</i> somewhat resembling them in shape and color. Even</p>

        <p class="calibre1">more remarkable is the fact that when <i class="calibre4">poganki</i> make their appearance among</p>

        <p class="calibre1">good mushrooms, the latter begin to disappear. Finally the wave of good mush-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">rooms passes, and the <i class="calibre4">poganki</i> complete the conquest of the site. This is espe-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">cially true of mushrooms that grow up in large clusters, such as <i class="calibre4">masleniki</i> [various</p>

        <p class="calibre1">viscid boleti], <i class="calibre4">ryzhiki</i> [various lactarii], and <i class="calibre4">beljanki</i> [lactarius pubescens].</p>

        <p class="calibre1">All hunters know that mushrooms have their 'favorite spots', where each year</p>

        <p class="calibre1">they grow in varying quantity. No doubt there must be natural causes for this,</p>

        <p class="calibre1">but to an uninformed mind this phenomenon is striking and inexplicable. In</p>

        <p class="calibre1">a thick forest where the branches and the roots of the trees meet, it is hard to</p>

        <p class="calibre1">determine the places favored by mushrooms even if such places exist, but in</p>

        <p class="calibre1">open forests or clearings they are obvious and beyond doubt. I have a wood</p>

        <p class="calibre1">with two thousand oaks, old and young. The old ones numbering about 200</p>

        <p class="calibre1">stand far apart in a large hay-field. Under certain of them, few in number, there</p>

        <p class="calibre1">have grown from time immemorial an immense quantity of caps of a somewhat</p>

        <p class="calibre1">distinctive form and size, unusually firm and strong, with caps of rare bronze</p>

        <p class="calibre1">and steel-like color, and sometimes multi-colored and shiny like marble. Their</p>

        <p class="calibre1">size and vigor are probably traceable to the nature of the root sap, and their</p>

        <p class="calibre1">color to the effects of sunlight, because oaks set far apart give little shade. Around</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the other oaks in the same clearing there are very few mushrooms, and around</p>

        <p class="calibre1">some, none at all. I have in my garden and park more than 300 spruces, and only</p>

        <p class="calibre1">under four of them do <i class="calibre4">ryzhiki</i> spring up. The location, the soil, the species of</p>

        <p class="calibre1">trees - all these are the same, and nevertheless for twelve years now I observe</p>

        <p class="calibre1">and yearly confirm my observation that my mushrooms are born exclusively</p>

        <p class="calibre1">in the same favorite spots under the same oaks and spruces.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">396</p>

        <p class="calibre1">APPENDIX II</p>

        <p class="calibre1">Different species of mushrooms coming up under different trees exhibit a re-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">markable trait in preferring to appear on the north side of the tree, much less</p>

        <p class="calibre1">often on the east and west sides, and on the south side, especially during a dry</p>

        <p class="calibre1">summer, they are almost totally absent. This influence of the four compass</p>

        <p class="calibre1">points and the position of the sun is best observed with the <i class="calibre4">ryzhiki.</i> The red</p>

        <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ryzhiki</i> [lactarius deliciosus;] around a given spruce always appear on the north</p>

        <p class="calibre1">side and halfway around to the east and west, whereupon, as if by a drawn line</p>

        <p class="calibre1">on approaching the south, their caps become greenish blue with a somewhat</p>

        <p class="calibre1">roughened surface, as though dried out; although the stem and the inside of the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">broken cap remain equally red and juicy. From this we see that the circumference</p>

        <p class="calibre1">of the tree is divided into equal sectors, the red <i class="calibre4">ryzhiki</i> being on the north side,</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the greenish on the south, while east and west are equally divided between both</p>

        <p class="calibre1">kinds, with the fewest specimens on the south side.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">There is no doubt that, as people believe, in rainy, soggy years mushrooms</p>

        <p class="calibre1">spring up in greater numbers, especially if bad weather is accompanied by</p>

        <p class="calibre1">warmth. But here too there are exceptions, not understood by the ordinary</p>

        <p class="calibre1">observer and only to be explained by science. I have often noticed that in spite</p>

        <p class="calibre1">of very warm air, rains may be harmful to mushrooms. At times this harmful</p>

        <p class="calibre1">effect works slowly and imperceptibly, but at times it acts with amazing rapid-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">ity, before your very eyes, especially with young mushrooms just emerging</p>

        <p class="calibre1">from the earth. Four times during the last twelve years I have seen devastation</p>

        <p class="calibre1">wrought by rain that fell apparently in conditions of propitious warmth. Twice</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the rain was accompanied by a sort of dry fog with a nasty burning smell;</p>

        <p class="calibre1">and twice the rains were downpours which thoroughly soaked the earth, with</p>

        <p class="calibre1">sunshine following immediately afterwards. Visiting every day about noon all</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the mushroom-bearing spots of my garden and park, there where on the eve</p>

        <p class="calibre1">I had left a host of young ceps, I was struck by the sudden change in their</p>

        <p class="calibre1">appearance. More or less all the young baby-mushrooms had become wrinkled</p>

        <p class="calibre1">and dried out, and the smallest ones, the size of a pea, and even those the size of a</p>

        <p class="calibre1">hazel-nut, had disappeared, and only a half-rotted dust, which was hard to iden-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">tify, lay where the mushroom buds had been. Some of the more adult mush-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">rooms revived and reached their usual size, but in a somewhat deformed shape.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">Others rotted away and collapsed. Such harmful effects were observed and</p>

        <p class="calibre1">recorded by me each time. A similar influence but noticeably slower is at times</p>

        <p class="calibre1">brought about by an excessive dew at night, which produces yellowish spots on</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the grass. Furthermore, let it here be set down that the current popular belief</p>

        <p class="calibre1">according to which a mushroom duly noted and marked by man will not grow</p>

        <p class="calibre1">up but will shrivel up, is, according to my observations, wholly unjust. I have</p>

        <p class="calibre1">397</p>

        <p class="calibre1">APPENDIX II</p>

        <p class="calibre1">always marked a goodly number of mushrooms, especially ceps, in order to</p>

        <p class="calibre1">gather them at the age which I consider most desirable, or else I leave them to</p>

        <p class="calibre1">reach their full development and beauty. I will not conceitedly assert that the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">gaze of man may not produce a magnetic influence in the vegetable world.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">All I can say is that my innumerable experiments led me to conclude that</p>

        <p class="calibre1">at least <i class="calibre4">my</i> glance never did any harm to mushrooms.1 I have even tried to touch</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the mushrooms lightly and free them from the leaves and grass which at times</p>

        <p class="calibre1">hamper their growth. I have gone so far as to break off bits of their caps, and they</p>

        <p class="calibre1">continued to grow as before. One thing is true: if you shake the stem of the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">mushroom, it wilts and perishes.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">In bad weather and toward fall the mushrooms give wider berth to the trees</p>

        <p class="calibre1">and more willingly grow along the edges of woods and on naked hills - they 'leap</p>

        <p class="calibre1">away', as the people express it; but in the dry and hot weather the mushrooms</p>

        <p class="calibre1">cling to the shade and even take shelter under the branches of the trees, especially</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the spruces that spread their branches like paws along the earth. That is why peas-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">ants call such branches <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">lapniki</b></i> [paws], and chop them off for various needs without</p>

        <p class="calibre1">mercy and without harm to the tree. They even assert that the spruce reaches</p>

        <p class="calibre1">its full size for lumber if you groom it by chopping down the lower branches.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">Apart from harmful rains and dew, mushrooms are damaged in clearings by</p>

        <p class="calibre1">the hot rays of the midday sun. Such rays scorch their caps, and although the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">coolness of the night, the dew, and an occasional rain freshen them up, the daily</p>

        <p class="calibre1">sun-burn makes them shrivel before they reach their full maturity. Lengthy and</p>

        <p class="calibre1">frequent rains in their turn damage the growth of mushrooms, especially in the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">shade, in thick grass and overgrown spots. The mushrooms rot, .grow mouldy,</p>

        <p class="calibre1">and perish. They are also spoiled and destroyed by living enemies. Slugs and</p>

        <p class="calibre1">snails firmly attach themselves to mushrooms, eating and boring through the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">caps and stems. In years of poor mushroom harvests, it is rare to find one not</p>

        <p class="calibre1">harboring two or three slugs. Squirrels are also mushroom hunters, going out</p>

        <p class="calibre1">especially for ceps, and often you will find marks of sharp teeth on their chewed</p>

        <p class="calibre1">caps. But the worst pest of mushrooms is a small white worm. Some years there</p>

        <p class="calibre1">are so many that the stem of every cep, strong and healthy on the outside, is</p>

        <p class="calibre1">inevitably undermined inside, and falls to pieces if picked up carelessly or firmly.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">Fortunately the caps are the last to be attacked by worms, and often remain</p>

        <p class="calibre1">healthy and intact with the stem completely eaten away. It is surprising how</p>

        <p class="calibre1">mushrooms in such a condition continue to receive nourishment.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">i. The Swiss mycologist F. Leuba, in discussing the morel, refers to the same popular belief, which he must have</p>

        <p class="calibre1">encountered in his native country. See <i class="calibre4">Les Champignons Comestibles et les Especes Veneneuses,</i> Neuchatel, 1890,</p>

        <p class="calibre1">The current notion that, especially after a rain, mushrooms spring up over-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">night, is not true. Nevertheless, it is true that at times one finds young mushrooms</p>

        <p class="calibre1">where none were seen the night before. They were there, however, but remained</p>

        <p class="calibre1">unnoticed, because they were hardly above the ground, and covered with leaves</p>

        <p class="calibre1">and grass. Those quickest to mature or rather to grow up, such as the <i class="calibre4">berjozoviki</i></p>

        <p class="calibre1">[boletus scaber] and <i class="calibre4">syroezhki</i> [various russulse], reach full development in three</p>

        <p class="calibre1">days, but the ceps take a week or more. The slowest to grow is the <i class="calibre4">dubovik,</i> a</p>

        <p class="calibre1">worthless mushroom and even poisonous, as I said before.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">In good harvest years mushrooms may be seen in clusters and families. They</p>

        <p class="calibre1">even grow as twins or triplets or more. I speak of those mushrooms that usually</p>

        <p class="calibre1">grow single, such as the ceps, the birch-mushrooms, the aspen-mushrooms, etc.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">I once made a sketch of an aspen-mushroom that showed six stems covered by</p>

        <p class="calibre1">one cap. A superabundance of mycelium and of the earth's sap at times produces</p>

        <p class="calibre1">freakish and ugly forms. Once I found a russula with another russula growing out</p>

        <p class="calibre1">of its cap. I made a drawing of this curious monstrosity. More than once I have</p>

        <p class="calibre1">found in the earth large lumps of the mycelium of the cep, a mass much re-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">sembling a root and the size of a man's head.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">This is the order of the appearance of mushrooms. As soon as it begins to</p>

        <p class="calibre1">thaw in the spring, the morels appear in the meadows and the open woods.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">At first <i class="calibre4">theglukhie</i> ['deaf ones', an helvella], then the <i class="calibre4">strojki</i> [morchella esculentaj.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">They grow even under a crust of snow with water rushing beneath. After the</p>

        <p class="calibre1">morels a month elapses, or more if there is drought, during which there are no</p>

        <p class="calibre1">mushrooms whatever. Then come the <i class="calibre4">masljaniki, berjozoviki, syroezhki, osinoviki</i></p>

        <p class="calibre1">[boletus versipellis], then the first wave of <i class="calibre4">gruzdi, podgruzdki</i> [various kinds of</p>

        <p class="calibre1">lactarii], and ceps; then follow the <i class="calibre4">lisichki</i> [chanterelles], and field mushrooms;</p>

        <p class="calibre1">finally come the autumn mushrooms, viz., <i class="calibre4">volzhanki</i> [lactarius torminosus],</p>

        <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">beljanki, ryzhiki,</i> and <i class="calibre4">opjonki.</i> This whole order is upset at times, and it always</p>

        <p class="calibre1">depends on the weather and the atmospheric influences. I must add that each</p>

        <p class="calibre1">species appears in two or three waves during summer and fall, and until fre-</p>

        <p class="calibre1">quent and strong frosts, especially during droughts, finally kill off the mushroom</p>

        <p class="calibre1">growth. Speaking of each species of mushroom separately, I shall tell in more</p>

        <p class="calibre1">detail of the occasional mutations in their growth.</p>

        <p class="calibre1">Aksakov's essay ends here. Apparently he never returned to the subject, and his</p>

        <p class="calibre1">observations on growth 'mutations' are lost to us. He died in 1859, three years after</p>
