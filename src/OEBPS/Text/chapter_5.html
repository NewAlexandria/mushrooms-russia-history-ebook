    <p><span class="initial">T</span>OADSTOOL is a strange term, and doubly strange because no one in our word-<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">conscious times seems to have paused to look at it. Toads do not sit on wild&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">fungi, nor under nor around them; neither do they eat them. Indeed toads and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">frogs have no direct physical or biological link with toadstools. Our word, with&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">roots deep in our folkways, is not, in any way obvious to us, a distillate of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">man's observation of nature. The Oxford Dictionary says it is a 'fanciful' name,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">and thus sidesteps a riddle. Not infrequently commercial artists and fanciful&nbsp;</span>illustrators of children's books represent toads with toadstools, and occasionally even photographers contrive by trickery1 to juxtapose the two. In every such instance they draw their inspiration from the word, not from nature.</p>

      Why 'toadstool'; This question sank its spurs in us some years ago and pricked us onwards, until soon we found ourselves launched on a pilgrimage to far-off places and remote times, to the frontiers of men's knowledge and beyond, where we sought to discern vistas behind the beginnings of recorded history. Through the worn faces of familiar words we re-discovered things that civilized men had forgotten. We may have found, in the end, successive
