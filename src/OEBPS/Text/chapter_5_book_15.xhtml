            <p><span class="initial">W</span>ith the concluding words of the previous section we had thought to end our discussion of the divine mushrooms. But in 1955 we returned again to Mexico to push our inquiries, and, at last breaking through the barrier of native shyness, we penetrated into the mushroom cult much more deeply than before, eating the mushrooms ourselves as participants in a communal agape. We experienced subjectively for the first time what we had previously been able to describe only as witnesses from the outside or at second hand by the testimony of informants. Just as our book goes to press we add the following notes on our 1955 adventures.</p>
            <p>On Friday, June 24, VPW, Masha, and RGW flew to Mexico City. We installed ourselves in a small villa in San Angel, at Reyna 9, which we had rented with servants as a base for our excursions. Thither we could return and relax in the quiet of a lovely garden, the high walls festooned with blooming bougainvillea, after our sorties into the Indian country. Two days later Allan Richardson joined us, to serve again as our photographer, and on Monday he and RGW set out for the heart of the Mazatec country. By Tuesday night we were bedded down with a Mazatec family in one of the villages of that remote world in northern Oaxaca. On this trip Robert Weitlaner was prevented by other duties from accompanying us, and we therefore considered ourselves doubly fortunate when almost at once, in a new circle of Indians, we found ourselves received as friends.</p>

            <p>We shall call our host Cayetano and his wife Guadalupe. Intelligent, vigorous, and gentle, this couple, in their thirties, were the key to the success of our expedition. As soon as RGW imparted to them in confidence his interest in the sacred mushrooms, they pledged their cooperation, and they more than made good their pledge.</p>

            <p>Cayetano and Guadalupe&#8217;s house is on the outskirts of Huautla de Jiménez and opens directly on the village thoroughfare that runs along a mountain-side. With roof of thatch and adobe walls, it has two storeys. You enter on the upper level from the street, and then by a small trap-door in one corner you climb down a steep and twisting stairway to the floor below, where the events that we shall relate took place. This lower storey is built on one side against the mountain face, and on the other side by a door it opens on a terrace perhaps six feet wide, which then falls sharply away to the ravine hundreds of feet below.</p>

            <p>Across the valley and beyond, the Sierra Mazateca in all its verdant glory fills the distant view. On the terrace at one end of the house a flimsy wooden and thatch annex has been constructed to serve as kitchen. The interior is divided by a whitewashed adobe wall into two rooms. There is no window in either room, but over the door on the terrace an aperture allows in some light. This room was well sheltered from the life of the village, and doubly so at night when Mazatec villagers refrain from stirring abroad. The family circle was large: our hosts&#8217; small children were numerous, and Cayetano&#8217;s brothers and parents were also much in evidence, as well as other kin. Chickens and turkeys had the run of the lower floor. A hen sitting on her eggs on one of the cluttered tables was a silent witness to all that went on.</p>

            <p>On the day after our arrival, early in the afternoon of Wednesday June 29, Cayetano and his brother Genaro took us down the mountain side to the edge of the stream in the gully. In the lower reaches of our descent we skirted a field planted to sugar cane, and then arrived at the spot where it is the custom to mill the cane, a flat space the size of a threshing floor, thick with rotting bagasse, as the refuse from the mill is called. There in the bagasse, just as Cayetano had promised, we found an immense crop of mushrooms, of the sacred kind known to our Mazatec friends as <i>ki<sup>3</sup>šo<sup>1</sup></i> &#8216;<a name="landslide-2">landslide</a>&#8217;. We photographed them to our hearts&#8217; content. We gathered them in a pasteboard box: the sacred mushrooms must always be carried in a closed parcel, never exposed to the view of passers-by. They were a noble lot, mostly young, all of them perfect in their moist health and fragrance. Then we carried them up the steep mountain side to the house. We were warned that if we saw any dead animal on the way, the mushrooms would lose their virtue — happily we saw none. It was in the rainy season, and in the humid heat of that sunny afternoon the climb was long and exhausting.</p>

            <p>Hardly had we arrived back when Cayetano sent us, with his brother Emilio as interpreter, to a cottage some distance farther up, where he said we would find a <i>curandera de primera categoría</i>, a <i>curandera</i> of the first class, María Sabina by name. We were to ask her whether she would help us that night. We found the Seiiora, as our hosts always called her, resting on a <i>petate</i>, or mat made of a certain palm. She was alone with a daughter who was up and about. After introducing ourselves through Emilio, we showed them our mushrooms, whereupon the two women went into raptures over their fine condition and beauty. We put our question to the Senora, and without hesitation, looking steadily at us, she said yes. Neither she nor her daughter spoke a word of Spanish. We do not know whether they had been told to expect our visit.</p>

            <p>María Sabina is a woman in her fifties, grave in demeanor, with a grave smile, short of stature like all Mazatecs, dressed in the Mazatec <i>huipil</i>. Her daughter is in her thirties and in all respects takes after her mother. She is following her mother&#8217;s vocation. The Señora herself is at the peak of her powers, and it is easy to see why Guadalupe had said to us of her that she was <i>una Señora sin mancha</i>, a lady without blemish, immaculate, one who had never dishonored her calling by using her powers for evil. She alone, said Guadalupe, had brought the latter&#8217;s children through all the diseases that take a frightful toll in early childhood in the Mazatec country. After that initial talk we were to pass two all-night vigils with Doña María and her daughter, and we can testify that she is a woman of rare moral and spiritual power, dedicated in her vocation, an artist in her mastery of the techniques of her office. It was her example that drove home for us for the first time a rule that must govern all field anthropologists. In the archaic cultures as among advanced peoples, there is a hierarchy of excellence when it comes to the individuals who are the culture-bearers. It is not sufficient to rely on the first informants that present themselves, on any shaman who is willing to talk. The whole cultural area must be discreetly surveyed and communication must be established with the finest exponents of the old traditions. None of the formidable difficulties of physical existence in these remote regions nor of communication should be permitted to blunt this obligation.</p>

            <p>On that last Wednesday of June, after nightfall, we gathered in the lower chamber of Cayetano&#8217;s house. In all, at one time or another, there must have been twenty-five persons present, mostly members old and young of Cayetano&#8217;s family. The Señora came with her daughter Polonia. They and all the others were pleased when we photographed them, and we took numerous pictures throughout the preliminaries. But the Señora requested through Cayetano that when the power would seize her — <i>cuando la fuerza le aganara</i> — we should desist, and of course we did so. Cayetano served us chocolate to drink, somewhat ceremonially. (RGW&#8217;s thoughts went back to Sahagiin in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, who had said that chocolate was served before the mushrooms were taken. Cayetano also offered us coffee and sweet wheaten bread, neither of which had been known to his ancestors in pre-Conquest Mexico.) Both Allan Richardson and RGW were deeply impressed by the mood of the gathering. We were received and the night&#8217;s events unrolled in an atmosphere of simple friendliness that reminded us of the agape of early Christian times. There was no familiarity. The mushrooms were treated respectfully, as sacred, but without marked formality. The proceedings went forward with an easy decorum. Neither on this occasion nor at any other time or place did we ever see or hear the mushrooms treated as a subject for jocular vulgarity, of the kind that often marks the use of alcohol among fully civilized peoples. The atmosphere of respectful friendliness was infectious, and we enjoyed reciprocating the welcome extended to us. There is no record that any white men had ever attended a session of the kind that we are going to describe, nor that white men had ever partaken of the sacred mushrooms under any circumstances. For reasons deeply rooted in the mortal cultural conflict of Spaniards and Indians, it is unlikely that any unrecorded event of the kind had ever taken place. By hearsay the early Spanish writers had reported gatherings of Indians where the mushrooms were served to many, but we had thought from our previous visits to Mexico that such observances were today unknown. We were now to learn that they still go on, and that they are even today a central experience in the culture of the Mazatec people. The only change is that the gatherings now are held behind closed doors. Cayetano told us early in the evening that no one on any account should leave the house before break of day, and for the necessities of nature he showed us the rudimentary provision that had been made in one corner of the other room. The contempt of the Spaniards for indigenous rites and the Church&#8217;s condemnation of them as idolatrous heresies have not killed these assemblies of ancient lineage, but have driven them under cover.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b15-fn1" id="cp5b15-r1">[1]</a></sup> Our hosts were obviously pleased by our intense and sympathetic interest in all that went on before our eyes. The very fact of our participation must have made the evening memorable for them. They were dressed up for the occasion. Genaro in particular was resplendent in his handsome striped sarape and his freshly washed white cotton trousers or bags, which Indian-style were buttonless, being supported by strings tied around the waist. By our respectful behavior we did all we could to make clear that for us the rite we were witnessing possessed full religious stature. We were mindful of the drama of our situation. We were attending as participants a mushroomic Supper of unique anthropological interest, which was being held pursuant to a tradition of unfathomed age, possibly going back to the time when the remote ancestors of our hosts were living in Asia, back perhaps to the very dawn of man&#8217;s cultural history, when he was discovering the idea of God.</p>

            <p>There were a few home-made wooden chairs in the room, and in the beginning Allan and RGW used them. Cayetano&#8217;s brother Genaro and possibly one other remained seated on chairs the whole night through. The others lay or reclined on mats on the floor, wrapped in <i>sarapes</i>, except of course for the Sefiora and her daughter, who, wearing clean <i>huipiles</i> with identical reddish-yellow birds embroidered on them in front, sat before the altar-table on mats. They sat with what seemed a half-studied formality, the daughter a little behind her mother and slightly to her mother&#8217;s right. Later, in the dark, we could barely discern their triangular shadows as first one and then the other lifted her voice in song. It was then, when the details were erased by night and only the geometric mass persisted, that they suddenly reminded RGW of the pyramids that are the outstanding feature of architecture in pre-Conquest Mexico. Could the pyramids have been originally a geometric stylization of the worshipping Indian seated on his mat, of the gods that were his magnified projection of himself?</p>

            <p>At about 10.30 o&#8217;clock the Señiora and her daughter took their positions before the small table that served for an altar. On it were two holy pictures, on the left the child Jesus and on the right the Baptism in Jordan, with a bouquet in front of them, a crucifix hidden in the flowers, three lighted candles of virgin beeswax, and a lighted wick in a glass of wax. There were also two pottery bowls and some cups. The Señora then went through our box of mushrooms, brushing off with her fingers the grosser pieces of dirt and passing them in her hand over copal that was burning on a metal lid on the floor. Into each of the two bowls she put 13 pair of mushrooms; one bowl was for her and the other for her daughter. Into each cup she put four pair, or five, or six, and then handed the cups to the grown-ups that were to take them. The children received none, and we were told that she never gave mushrooms to children. To RGW she handed a cup with six pair. Our readers will imagine his joy at this dramatic culmination to years of pursuit. Then she handed a cup with six pair to poor Allan. Mary, his wife, had reluctantly consented to his coming with us only on his solemn promise not to let the nasty <a name="toadstool-15">toadstools</a> cross his lips. He faced a behavior dilemma, but to have refused might have disappointed our friendly Indian companions, and so he coped with the immediate problem first and took the cup. (Later, with him safely back in New York, Mary gave him ready absolution.) By now all lights in the room were out except the wick in the glass. Following the Seiiora&#8217;s example, we began to chew and swallow our mushrooms.</p>

            <p>Our <i>curandera</i> ate cap and stem, and we did likewise. She ate them one by one, with utmost gravity, chewing each one for a long time. She did not pick them up by pairs, as Don Aurelio had done in 1953. She picked them up one by one, although in apportioning them she had counted them by pairs. The flavor of the mushrooms is acrid and unpleasant. Don Roberto afterwards likened it to rancid grease, a taste unfamiliar to us. The distinctive flavor would repeat itself, as a gaseous beverage does, and pervade the nasal passages. (At the time these notes are being written, in September 1955, RGW has eaten five species of the divinatory mushrooms used in Middle America, and they are all marked by this singular and unforgettable taste and after-taste, which seem to be the veritable signature of the divine species.)</p>

            <p>We all ate our mushrooms facing the wall where the small altar table stood. We ate them in silence, except for Cayetano&#8217;s father, Don Emilio, who was consulting the mushrooms about his infected left-forearm. He would jerk his head violently with each mushroom that he swallowed, and utter a smacking noise, as though in acknowledgement of their divine potency. The Señora had asked us to take care not to invade the corner of the room on the left of the altar table, for down that corner would descend the Holy Ghost. We sat near-by, taking about a half hour to eat our six pair of mushrooms. By 10.40 o&#8217;clock we had all finished our respective portions, the Señiora crossing herself with the last swallow. Then we waited in silence. After about twenty minutes the Señora plucked a flower from the bouquet and with it put out the last of the <i>velas</i>. We should have been in Stygian darkness, but by good fortune the night was clear and a gibbous moon, by the opening above the door, gave us just enough light to make our darkness visible.</p>

            <p>At about 11.20 o&#8217;clock Allan leaned from his chair and whispered to RGW that he was having a chill. We wrapped him in a blanket. A little later he leaned over again and said, &#8216;Gordon, I am beginning to see things,&#8217; to which RGW gave him the comforting reply that he was too. Allan lay down along the wall on the large <i>petate</i> that had been spread for us, and shortly afterwards RGW joined him.</p>

            <p>Except for the children who had eaten no mushrooms, no one slept that night until about 4 o&#8217;clock in the morning. (The last entry in RGW&#8217;s notebook carries the hour 3.50.) There was no inclination to sleep. At all times we were alert both to our subjective hallucinations and to the goings-on around us in the dark. RGW took imperfect notes intermittently and kept track of the hours. But he and Allan were both alive to the fact that they were not themselves. Though RGW had resolved to fight off any effects of the mushrooms and remain the detached observer, the mushrooms took full and sweeping possession of him. There is no better way to describe the sensation than to say that it was as though his very soul had been scooped out of his body and translated to a point floating in space, leaving behind the husk of clay, his body. &#8216;<a name="landslide-3">Landslide</a>&#8217;, the designation of the Mazatecs for the mushroom we were using, had seemed to him a clumsy name before; now its awesome truth imposed itself. Our bodies lay there while our souls soared. We both felt nauseated; RGW twice made his way to the other room to vomit, and Allan three times. One or two others, not identified in the darkness, did likewise. But these episodes seemed of no moment. For we were both seeing visions, similar but not identical visions, and we were comparing notes in whispered interchanges. At first we saw geometric patterns, angular not circular, in richest colors, such as might adorn textiles or carpets. Then the patterns grew into architectural structures, with colonnades and architraves, patios of regal splendor, the stone-work all in brilliant colors, gold and onyx and ebony, all most harmoniously and ingeniously contrived, in richest magnificence extending beyond the reach of sight, in vistas measureless to man. For some reason these architectural visions seemed oriental, though at every stage RGW pointed out to himself that they could not be identified with any specific oriental country. They were neither Japanese nor Chinese nor Indian nor Moslem. They seemed to belong rather to the imaginary architecture described by the visionaries of the Bible. In the æsthetics of this discovered world attic simplicity had no place: everything was resplendently rich.</p>

            <p>At one point in the faint moonlight the bouquet on the table assumed the dimensions and shape of an imperial conveyance, a triumphal car, drawn by living creatures known only to mythology. With our eyes wide open, the visions came in endless succession, each growing out of the preceding one. We had the sensation that the walls of our humble house had vanished, that our untrammeled souls were floating in the universe, stroked by divine breezes, possessed of a divine mobility that would transport us anywhere on the wings of a thought. Now it was clear why Don Aurelio in 1953 and others too had told us that the mushrooms would take you <i>ahí donde Dios está</i> &#8212; there where God is. Only when RGW by an act of conscious effort touched the wall of Cayetano&#8217;s house, would he be brought back to the confines of the room where we all were, and this touch with reality seemed to be what precipitated nausea in him.</p>

            <p>On that night of June 29-30 we saw no human beings in our visions. On the night of July 2-3 RGW again took mushrooms in the same room, with the Señora again serving as votary. If we may anticipate our story, on that second occasion RGW&#8217;s visions were different. There were no geometrical patterns, no edifices of oriental splendor. The patterns were replaced by artistic motifs of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods in England - armor worn for fashionable display, family escutcheons, the carvings of choir stalls and cathedral chairs. No patina of age hung on them. They were all fresh from God&#8217;s work-shop, pristine in their finish. The beholder could only sigh after the skill that would have fixed those beauteous shapes on paper or in metal or wood, that they might not be lost in a vision. They too grew one out of the other, the new one emerging from the center of its predecessor. Here as in the first night the visions seemed freighted with significance. They seemed the very archetypes of beautiful form and color. We felt ourselves in the presence of the Ideas that Plato had talked about. In saying this let not the reader think that we are indulging in rhetoric, straining to command his attention by an extravagant figure of speech. For the world our visions were and must remain &#8216;hallucinations&#8217;. But for us they were not false or shadowy suggestions of real things, figments of an unhinged imagination. What we were seeing was, we knew, the only reality, of which the counterparts of every day are mere imperfect adumbrations. At the time we ourselves were alive to the novelty of this our discovery, and astonished by it. Whatever their provenience, the blunt and startling fact is that our visions were sensed more clearly, were superior in all their attributes, were more authoritative, for us who were experiencing them, than what passes for mundane reality.</p>

            <p>Following the visions that we have already described, on both occasions RGW saw landscapes. On Wednesday they were of a vast desert seen from afar, with lofty mountains beyond, terrace above terrace. Camel caravans were advancing across the mountain slopes. On Saturday the landscapes were of the estuaries of immense rivers brimming over with pellucid water, broad sheets of water overflowing into the reeds that stretched equally far from the shore line. Here the colors were in pastel shades. The light was good but soft as from a horizontal sun. On both nights the landscapes responded to the command of the beholder: when a detail interested him, the landscape approached with the speed of light and the detail was made manifest. There seemed to be no birds and no human life in the river estuary, until a rude cabin suddenly appeared with a woman motionless nearby. She was a woman by her figure and face and costume, and of course the vision was in color. But she was a statue in that she stood there without expression, doing nothing, staring into the distance. She might be compared to those archaic Greek sculptures where the woman gazes into space, or, better yet, the departing woman on the Greek funerary stele who looks into eternity, except that our vision was of a living woman whereas the Greek sculptures, marble white, are mere imitations in stone of what we were seeing.</p>

            <p>On both nights RGW stood up for a long time in Cayetano&#8217;s room, at the foot of the stairway, holding on to the rail, transfixed in ecstasy by the visions that he was seeing in the darkness with his open eyes. For the first time that word &#8216;ecstasy&#8217; took on subjective meaning for him. &#8216;Ecstasy&#8217; was not someone else&#8217;s state of mind. It was no longer a trite superlative cheapened by overuse. It signified something different and superior in kind, about which RGW could now testify as a competent witness. There came one moment when it seemed as though the visions themselves were about to be transcended, and dark gates reaching upward beyond sight were about to part, and we were to find ourselves in the presence of the Ultimate. We seemed to be flying at the dark gates as a swallow at a dazzling lighthouse, and the gates were to part and admit us. But they did not open, and with a thud we fell back, gasping. We felt disappointed, but also frightened and half relieved, that we had not entered into the presence of the Ineffable, whence, it seemed to us at the time, we might not have returned, for we had sensed that a willing extinction in the divine radiance had been awaiting us.</p>

            <p>We know not what manner of visions is induced by opium or hashish or coca or mescalin, nor whether the agent in our mushrooms that releases the visions is related to the agents in them. Later in the Zapotec country, the <i>curandero</i> Aristeo Matías told us that it takes three or four experiences with mushrooms to overcome the initial surprise and the disorder that marks the sequence of visions on the first occasions. (Here was fatherly advice from an old hand to us who had told him that we aspired to enter upon his vocation.) This would suggest that there is or at least can be a growth, an evolution, in the hallucinatory experiences induced by the mushrooms.</p>

            <p>Throughout the night we were strangely split in the very core of our being. On one level space was annihilated for us and we were traveling as fast as thought to our visionary worlds. On another level we were lying there on our <i>petates</i>, trying to take notes, RGW and Allan exchanging whispered comments, alive to every twitch and twinge in our heavy (oh so heavy!) earth-bound bodies of clay. At the same time we were both held in thrall by what was going on in the room around us. For the Señora and her daughter were engaged all night in a religious performance that we had not expected and that no one had ever described to us.</p>

            <p>Before we go further we must mention that when we had bespoken the Señora&#8217;s services in the afternoon, she had asked us what problem was troubling us. Once again RGW trotted out the question of his son Peter, now in the army. How was he? Alive or dead, or ill, or in good spirits, or in some trouble; This had seemed to her a sufficient justification. We had counted on Cayetano to stay with us through the night as our guide and interpreter. We observed that neither he nor Guadalupe were taking the mushrooms. As we were finishing ours, Cayetano informed us that he and his wife were withdrawing up the stairs and through the trap-door to the room above, where they would guard us against interruptions from the street. He was leaving his brother Emilio to act as our mentor. We sensed that each of the other adults who were taking the mushrooms was consulting them, as we were, about individual problems.</p>

            <p>After the Señora had put out the last <i>vela</i>, a silence of perhaps twenty minutes followed. The moon was shining brightly outside, and its orbit was such that the shaft of moonlight entering above the door fell squarely on the altar-table, but it did little to relieve the general darkness in the room. Suddenly the Señora began to moan, low at first, then louder. There were silent pauses, and then renewed humming. Then the humming stopped and she began to articulate isolated syllables, each syllable consisting of a consonant followed by a vowel, sharply pronounced. The syllables came snapping out in rapid succession, cutting the darkness like a knife, spoken, not shouted. After a time the syllables coalesced into what we took for words, and the Señora began to chant. The chanting continued intermittently all night, first by the Señora and then by her daughter, and afterwards alternately by one or the other. The chanting was in Mazatec, and there was no one to translate the words for us. Neither Allan nor RGW is instructed musicologically, and we cannot say whether the provenience of the music was European or indigenous. That the chanting was in Mazatec, and not in Latin or Spanish learned by rote, adds point to this question. (If the chants are old, the language may be archaic, which would be a discovery of high interest for the handful of first-rate scholars who have devoted themselves to Mazatec linguistics.) Both women chanted in that distinctive way which seems always to mark the intoning of age-old chants; the singing was soaked in weary melancholy. Our Señora&#8217;s voice was not loud, probably not loud enough to be heard in the village thoroughfare. But there was a confidence and resonance in her primitive utterance that imposed itself. There came a moment late in the night when the Señiora made her way to the door on the terrace and went outside, holding her hand on the door. (To this extent she was free of the prohibition laid on the rest of us not to leave the house.) When she re-entered, she left the door slightly ajar, and we saw her advance <i>on her knees</i> across the open space in the room, and then turn to the right toward the altar-table. Her hands were uplifted to shoulder-level, palms exposed. As she slowly progressed, she sang a canticle that seemed like an introit, indescribably tender and plaintive in its musical phrases. Her daughter sang well too, but lacked her authority. From time to time, as they sang, the men who had taken the mushrooms, notably Genaro and young Emilio, ejaculated words, groans, short sentences, and vocal noises. We know not what they said, but they seemed to intervene with their voices to suit the singing, in such a way as to produce a strange, barbaric harmony.</p>

            <p>The singing was not continuous. For stretches the Señora would talk, as though <a name="divination-7">invoking the Spirits</a> or as though the Holy Ghost was speaking through the mushrooms. We heard the names of Christ (which she pronounced with an intrusive &#8216;r&#8217;, <i>Khristros</i>), of St. Peter and St. Paul. We heard her cry out &#8216;Pedro&#8217; repeatedly in an imploring tone, and knew that the mushrooms were wrestling with the problem of Peter. Emilio made his way to us and whispered that Peter was alive and well, and contrite for not having let us hear from him. We asked for further details, but Emilio said that since we ourselves had eaten the mushrooms, we could expect them to speak to us directly. Our interpreter Emilio then vanished into the darkness for the rest of the night.</p>

            <p>Unlike the chants, the spoken utterances were fresh and vibrant and rich in expressiveness. The mushrooms were talking to the point. We had never suspected how sensitive and poetic an instrument the Mazatec language could be. The intermittent snatches of the Señora&#8217;s monologue seemed quick with subtle feeling, laden with dramatic import. In our very presence a priestess of the old religion was pronouncing oracular dictates in spurts, hot and firm with authority. How we regretted that we had no means to record her voice! (At the time we asked ourselves, and we have repeated the question often since then, whether our critical faculties were deranged by the effects of the mushrooms, so that we over-rated the quality of the Señora&#8217;s performance. Perhaps so. But if this is an aberration typical of the syndrome of mushroomic ecstasy, our account at least serves to document it for the record, and to establish that our hallucinations were auditory as well as visual.)</p>

            <p>The chanting and the oracular utterances turned out to be only a part of what we were to witness. At an early stage we sensed that the Señora was either kneeling or standing before the altar-table gesticulating with her arms. We detected this by ear and confirmed it uncertainly with the aid of the meager moonlight. Then, much later in the night when her daughter took over the chanting, the Señora made her way to the open space between us and the door, and she embarked on a kind of dance that must have lasted for two hours or more. We do not know precisely what she did, because of the darkness, but she was between us and the aperture above the door, and we could just make out that she was turning clock-wise, facing in succession each of the four compass points, at the same time raising and lowering her arms. Her daughter was singing, but she was not silent. She was engaged in a lengthy, rhythmic percussive utterance of a kind unfamiliar to us. There was a differentiation in the pitch of the beats, and at times the pattern or phrases seemed to us complex. We cannot say for sure how she made her sounds, but we are almost sure that she clapped her hands, slapped her knees, smacked her forehead, and whammed her chest. We were impressed by the cleanness of the utterance. Every clap or slap or smack or wham was resonant. Remembering the role played by pitch in the Mazatec language, we asked ourselves whether the Seiiora was speaking percussively. On each of our two nights with her, she rinsed her mouth once with water, and the gargling was also rhythmic, and perhaps tonally differentiated. Then she would spit out the water on the ground unrhythmically. On Saturday night, in a moment of illumination by flashlight, we saw and heard her twicking her long finger nails rhythmically. A remarkable feature of her percussive utterance on Wednesday night was its ventriloquistic property. For a long stretch we were in the blackest darkness while the daughter sang and the Señora was performing her strange dance with percussive accompaniment. As she would snap out her resonant claps and smacks, we seemed to catch them out of the night from various directions. Let the reader remember that all the while we were seeing our visions <i>and</i> attending to the auditory sensations served to us by the two women. There we were, visually suspended in space before the vast panorama of, say, the Gobi Desert, with a singing accompaniment and with percussive cracks assailing us, now from above, now here, now there, exactly like Hamlet&#8217;s ghost <i>hic et ubique</i>, hitting us with a cutting crispness from unpredictable quarters, as though an air-borne choir of invisible creatures was peopling the dark void around us, perplexing us with their assorted and shifting cries. Possibly this ventriloquistic effect was caused by the Señora&#8217;s turning in different directions as she performed, so that the sound caromed to us from the ceiling or walls. And all the while there was the irregular chorus, subdued in volume, of ecstatic exclamations from the Indians reclining on the ground. Confined though we were in a room without windows or open door, at one point we felt a swish of air, just as though we were really suspended in the great outdoors. Was this too an hallucination? If so, all shared it, for when the wind blew on us, there was general excitement, flashlights were switched on, and our Indian friends were sitting up, amazed at being stroked by the Divine Afflatus.</p>

            <p>At one point in the night RGW made a discovery. In the light of a cigarette that someone was inhaling, he saw the Seiiora, who was performing her dance, lift a small bottle to her lips. From her posture the bottle seemed almost empty. A few minutes later she began to thump the butt end of the bottle on the <i>petate</i>. She did this with a fast, uniform, perfect beat, perhaps a hundred to the minute, and she kept at it for an eternity, minutes on end, until Allan and RGW could hardly stand it any longer and groaned in agony. The iterated thump, somewhat resonant, became excruciatingly painful, a torture such as Poe might have described. After the night had passed and we were all getting up, RGW made a point to find the bottle and smell it. There could be no doubt: it was the familiar six-ounce bottle of <i>aguardiente</i>, a distillate of cane. Presumably the Señiora had shared it with her daughter, but of this we are not sure. We asked Cayetano about it. Yes, invariably the person who retains the Seiiora is expected to present her in advance with a <i>cuarto</i> (fourth of a litre) of this strong drink. We in our ignorance had neglected our duty, but Cayetano had come to our rescue. Recalling as we did how Don Aurelio and our friends in the Mije country had all said that alcohol was tabu before, during, and after the consumption of the mushrooms, we are still at a loss how to reconcile the conflicting evidence. But of course the Señora&#8217;s performance from first to last had differed from what Don Aurelio had shown us in 1953. We had now attended two all-night vigils, both using the sacred mushrooms, but otherwise utterly different from each other. Don Aurelio&#8217;s divinatory liturgy, with the elaborate rôle in it of accessories, could conceivably go on without mushrooms, but in Cayetano&#8217;s house the mushrooms were the key to everything. We spoke to Cayetano about that other performance that we had seen in the Mazatec country in 1953. He knew all about that kind too, and he told us that the Señora was equally proficient in both ceremonies. We failed to learn, however, when one method is used in preference to the other.</p>

            <p>At intervals throughout the night, perhaps every forty minutes or so, there would be what we can only describe as intermissions. After working up to a powerful climax in utterance, the Señora and her daughter would subside into silence. We recall one such climax when the Señora, half-singing, half declaiming, spat forth in endless repetition and with barbaric violence the two syllables <i>chung-ha</i> (the first element riming, not with &#8216;sung&#8217;, but with the Chinese &#8216;Sung&#8217;); we were never able to learn what this meant. After such climaxes our two votaries and our reclining Indian friends would light cigarettes (ordinary ones) and smoke and engage in the most animated conversation. Clearly they were discussing what was happening, but we had no interpreter. They would light the electric torches. We took advantage of these moments to study the Señora. She was not in a trance. That is to say, she was one of us, talking and smoking. But she was in a state of excitement, her eyes flashing, her smile no longer that grave smile which we had observed before, but now quick with animation and, if we may use the word, <i>caritas</i>. For there is another aspect to the mushrooms that we must mention. The spirit of an agape of which we have already spoken was a prelude to a wave of generous or tender feelings that the mushrooms aroused in everyone. To illustrate this, we recall how, when nausea first sent one of us into the adjoining room to vomit, the Señora, who had been in full song, immediately stopped the performance, and she and the others manifested the most embarrassing solicitude about the unhappy episode, which after all was wholly unimportant. On the two nights that we passed in Cayetano&#8217;s house, we were aware of no erotic stimulation among those present and we think there was none. But the feeling of brotherly affection was strong indeed. Twice in the course of that first night the Señora reached out her right hand to RGW and sought contact with his fingers in friendly greeting, across the chasm of the language barrier. The Indians of Middle America are known for their reticence in the display of affection, even within the family circle. It was now clear that the mushrooms emancipate them from inhibitions of this kind, and what we witnessed on Wednesday night was abundantly confirmed during our second session on Saturday, July 2.</p>

            <p>After the first performance Allan and RGW, quite stunned and even numbed by what we had witnessed, were disposed to say, &#8216;Never again&#8217;. But by Saturday morning there were many questions that we needed to clarify, and so through Cayetano we asked the Señiora if she would give us a repetition. This she agreed to do. We pled with her to let us take a few photographs by flashlight while the power was on her. She said yes, and in the course of that night from Saturday to Sunday Allan took perhaps twenty pictures in the darkness, guessing of necessity as to the distance and direction. (It was raining in torrents all that night, and so there was no moon.) But the Señora&#8217;s behavior differed much from what we had seen the first time. Everything was reduced in scale. There was no dancing and virtually no percussive utterance. Only three or four other Indians were with us, and the Señiora brought with her, not her daughter, but her son Aurelio, a youth in his late teens who seemed to us in some way ill or defective. He and not we were the object of her attention. All night long her singing and her words were directed to this boy. Her performance was the dramatic expression of a mother&#8217;s love for her child, a lyric to mother-love, and interpreted in this way it was profoundly moving. The tenderness in her voice as she sang and spoke, and in her gestures as she leaned over Aurelio to caress him, moved us profoundly. As strangers we should have been embarrassed, had we not seen in this <i>curandera</i> possessed of the mushrooms a symbol of eternal motherhood, rather than the anguished cry of an individual parent. But by any interpretation this untrammeled and beautiful outpouring, touched off in all likelihood by the sacred mushrooms, was behavior of a kind that few Middle American anthropologists would ever expect to see.</p>

            <p>On this second occasion Allan took no mushrooms, for the sake of his photography. The Señiora asked RGW how many pair he would take, which he interpreted as a compliment to his status as one already initiated, and he said five. The effect seemed as strong as he had experienced from the larger dose on Wednesday, but this time there was no nausea.</p>

            <p>Both of our nights with the Señiora drew to a close in the same way. On the night of Wednesday-Thursday, our last notes seem to have been scribbled a few minutes before 4 a.m., and soon afterwards we slipped off imperceptibly into a dreamless slumber. Apparently everyone else did likewise. At any rate, at about 6 o&#8217;clock we woke up, our heads clear. Some of the others were already stirring, and in a few minutes everyone was on his feet. RGW changed the roll in his camera and resumed picture-taking, as did Allan. Cayetano and Guadalupe asked after our welfare but were discreet in their inquiries about the night&#8217;s doings. They served us coffee and bread. By 7 o&#8217;clock we were ready to sally forth into the world. We felt no untoward sleepiness that day.</p>

            <p>Perhaps in some respects we can define better than we have done the psychic disturbance caused by the sacred mushrooms. On the one hand, they unhinge one&#8217;s sense of time. Visions that seem to last an aeon run their course in a minute or so. Only by reference to a time-piece does one keep track of the passing hours. On the other hand, the faculty of memory is heightened by the mushrooms. All the impressions, visual and auditory, are graved as with a burin in the tablet of the memory. Our narrative of what took place has been checked with the notes that we jotted down at the time, but our memory is far richer and fuller than those notes.</p>

            <p>What can we say about the source of our visions ; Did they bubble up out of our own past ; We have no conscious memory of having viewed previously the scenes that we saw. There was nothing in them that repeated themes familiar to us in our adult experience, no modern highways, cars, cities. Yet all that we saw could be related to themes latent in our imagination, not necessarily things seen, nor even things seen in graphic representation, but those things transmuted afterwards in the imagination, imagined from reading, seen in the mind&#8217;s eye. All of the visions had that pristine quality which we associate most often with the magic of supreme literary expression, especially great poetry. In the lives of us all, even those who are most earth-bound, there are moments when things, even the most humdrum, suddenly and unaccountably clothe themselves with beauty, haunting and ravishing beauty. It now seems to us that all such flashes must emerge from the subconscious well where our visions have all this time been stored, for the mushroomic visions are an endless sequence of those flashes. There are those like Keats who have possessed the power to see such visions in abundance without the mushroomic stimulus. Could the mushrooms have done better by Keats than he did without them? What would they have shown him that he did not see? What precisely do our Indian friends see, with their different background? Clearly the visions come from within the beholder, either from his own unconscious or, as some will surely think, from an inherited fund of memories of the race. What an amazing thing that we should all be carrying this inventory of wonders around with us, ready to be tripped into our conscious world by mushrooms! Are the Indians far wrong in calling these divine; We suspect that, in its fullest sense, the creative faculty, whether in the humanities or science or industry, that most precious of man&#8217;s distinctive possessions and the one most clearly partaking of the divine, is linked in some way with the area of the mind that the mushrooms unlock.</p>

            <p>We believe that the mushrooms are not habit forming. If we are right, they differ in this respect, not only from alcohol, but from the drugs such as opium and marihuana that are reputed to stimulate beatific visions. In the course of our three expeditions to Mexico, covering four cultural areas, we never heard of a mushroom addict. We believe that use of the mushrooms does not affect the threshold of tolerance for them; that is to say, one does not raise the dose on successive occasions to obtain the same effect, either for the short run as when we used them twice in four days, or over the long term. Our Señiora and her daughter took more than twice the dose of the others, but this quota goes with their vocation. Everyone&#8217;s dose seems to remain constant throughout life, though the dose varies somewhat from person to person. We have seen no evidence that the mushrooms can cause harmful psychic effects but our experience is too limited for us to generalise about this. Are persons with neurotic or psychotic inclinations endangered by the mushrooms? After a life-time of use do mushroom-eating <i>curanderos</i> show mental deterioration? May there be individuals whose mushroomic visions are horrifying and who are stimulated to violence by them? We do not know. In considering the clinical effects of the mushrooms, let us not overlook the extraordinary performance of the Señiora and her daughter. They had each eaten more than twice as many pair of mushrooms as the rest of us, and they not only kept hold of themselves: they staged a liturgy that called for disciplined virtuosity of a high order.</p>

            <p>On Friday, July 1, VPW and Masha joined us in our village. We had all planned to leave immediately after the Saturday night experience, but the rains came and we found ourselves marooned among our Mazatec friends for most of the following week. On Tuesday the 5<sup>th</sup> VPW and Masha, having nothing else to do, took the mushrooms in the afternoon, VPW five pair and Masha four, and then they lay down in their sleeping bags. This was the first occasion on which white people ate the mushrooms for purely experimental purposes, without the aura of a native ceremony. They too saw their visions, for hours on end, all pleasant, mostly of a nostalgic kind. They felt little or no nausea. Their pupils dilated and failed to respond to our flashlights. The pulse showed a tendency to slow down. There were no auditory hallucinations. But six weeks later, when RGW in New York took the mushrooms for the third time on August 12, his visions were accompanied by an insistent beat with variation of pitch, perhaps an evocation of the Señora&#8217;s percussive performance. The beat was not unpleasant. It seemed freighted with meaning, as though it was the rhythmic pulse of the universe. When the Señiora had performed for us, we had passed most of the night in virtual darkness &#8212; an environment adapted to dilated eyes. Our experience in New York took place in a room illuminated by lights from the street, and moreover on that night of the 12<sup>th</sup> a hurricane known at the time as Connie was brushing by the city. We found that the mushrooms had retained their full potency in a dried state, if indeed their power had not increased. We made another discovery. As we stood at the window and watched the gale tossing the trees and the water of the East River, with the rain driven in squalls before the wind, the whole scene was further quickened to life by the abnormal intensity of the colors that we saw. We had always thought that El Greco&#8217;s apocalyptic skies over Toledo were a figment of the poet&#8217;s imagination. But on this night we saw El Greco&#8217;s skies, nothing dimmed, whirling over New York.</p>

            <p>Now we come to the end of our Mazatec experience. We had agreed from the beginning to pay the Señora her usual fee for her services. We paid her fifty pesos for each night, which was somewhat more than she expected. In dollars this meant $4.00 a night, but in her world the fee meant much more, perhaps subjectively as much as $50.00 in New York. Before we left the village we asked Cayetano what we could pay him for his contribution to the success of our visit. He turned to his wife and let her speak. <i>&#8216;No hicimos esto por dinero&#8217;</i>, she said, which is to say, &#8216;We did not do this for money&#8217;, and they would accept none. We were especially grateful to the Señora for having allowed us to take photographs while the power of the mushrooms was on her, during that second night. It had not been easy for her to consent to the rude interruption of the flashlight, and we ourselves knew also that the pictures would be misleading, as they would convey no idea of the darkness that Allan and ROW will always associate with the mushroomic agape. We noticed at the time that the flashlights upset the pace of her performance, interrupted the spontaneity of her singing. On the morning after, a messenger came to us from her. We were welcome to the pictures, she said, but would we please refrain from showing those particular ones to any except our most trusted friends, for if we showed them to all and sundry, <i>sería una traición</i>, it would be a betrayal. We are doing as the Señora asked us, showing these photographs only in those circles where we feel sure she would be pleased to have them shown. In order that she be not disturbed by the importunities of commercially-minded strangers, we have withheld the name of the village where she lives, and we have changed the names of the characters in our narrative. On our next visit we shall ask for permission to publish our pictures for general circulation.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">O</span>n Friday evening, July 8, we all arrived back in our home in San Angel, and after a good night&#8217;s sleep we were ready on the following day to pursue our quest for the divine mushrooms in new directions.</p>
            
            <p>RGW had received a letter in May from Mrs. Carmen Cook de Leonard of Mexico City, the well known student of indigenous cultures, with surprising information. It seemed that she and her colleague, Miss Bodil Christensen, had discovered that the use of the divine mushrooms still survived in a village not far from the capital city. They would be glad to place their information at our disposal, and to try to arrange for a <i>curandera</i> to consult the mushrooms on our behalf. After our arrival in Mexico and while we were in the Mazatec country, Mrs. Cook de Leonard and Miss Christensen talked with their <i>curandera</i> and she agreed to serve us on the evening of Saturday, July 9.</p>

            <p>On that Saturday afternoon we drove out to the town of Amecameca some forty miles away, and thence by a dirt road three miles to the bleak forbidding Indian village of San Pedro Nexapa. (The -<i>x</i>- in this name has the sound of a Spanish -<i>j</i>-.) We were now on the slopes of the volcano Popocatepetl, at about 8,000 feet altitude, above the Valley of Mexico. This was Aztec country, where even now the old people still can speak classic Nahuatl. We sought out the humble house where the <i>curandera</i> Marina Rosas lives, a flimsy wooden structure that freely admitted the cold, dank breezes. We found the aged lady seated on a <i>petate</i> and wrapped tight in her shawl near the wood fire on the floor. Though she must have known Nahuatl, Spanish was clearly her language of preference. She informed us that she was ill and therefore could not help us. She was sorry, but what could she do? She was ready to appoint another day, and we settled on Saturday, July 30. If we may anticipate the later events, we returned three weeks later, on that appointed day, only to discover that Marina Rosas, seated on the same <i>petate</i> in the same place, was again unable to help us, not because of illness this time but because, doubtful whether we were really going to arrive, she had broken her fast and eaten a midday meal. <i>Para que contesten ellos, ha de ser limpio el estómago</i> &#8212; for the mushrooms to reply, the stomach must be clean. The old lady was lovable in her excuses and protestations, but RGW felt that she really did not wish to eat the mushrooms for us.</p>

            <p>But our visits to San Pedro Nexapa were not fruitless. We learned from Marina that only one kind of divinatory mushroom is known in the village and we obtained a small packet of dried specimens. As in the Mije and Mazatec regions, one considers that the mushrooms speak, not the person who eats them. The mushrooms are gathered in September, around the time of the Cholula fair, above the village on the slopes of the volcano, perhaps as high as 10,000 feet. In the Mije and Mazatec regions we had learned that in the hot low country the mushrooms are not used. Now we discovered that the higher limits are high indeed. They are eaten only in a dried condition and they keep for a year, until the next ones are gathered. According to Marina, the whole mushroom is eaten, pileus and stipe. Marina never used the word <i>curandero</i>. He who knows how to use the mushrooms is a <i>trabajador del cielo</i>, a heavenly worker. Sometimes the <i>trabajador</i> gives them to the sick person to eat, but the mushrooms will not speak through the sick person because he is not chosen. We discovered from Marina that she customarily takes six pair, but with the six pair she also takes twelve seeds possessed of parallel psychic powers. These seeds are called in Nahuatl &#8216;<a name="birds-eyes">bird</a>&#8217;s-eyes&#8217; and in the Spanish of Mexico <i>colorines</i>. To botanists they are the seeds of the rhynchosia pyramidalis (Lam.) Urban, also known as the rhynchosia phaseoloides (Sw.) DC. They are bright red with a large black spot, the size of a bird&#8217;s eyes. The black spot does not cover the hilum or eye of the seed, and this is precisely what distinguishes the seeds used by Marina from the poisonous seeds of the abrus precatorium L., which superficially look alike but whose hilum is black. Marina spoke of the divinatory mushrooms as <i>los ninos</i>, &#8216;the children&#8217;. The significance of this name becomes apparent only when we learn that the Nahuatl term in Marina&#8217;s village is <i>apipiltzin</i>, wherein <i>-tzin</i> is the diminutive suffix, <i>-pipil-</i> means &#8216;children&#8217;, and <i>a-</i> stand for <i>atl</i>, &#8216;water&#8217;. In this village high in the mountains where classical Nahuatl is spoken, our mushrooms are the &#8216;<a name="children-waters-1">little children of the waters</a>&#8217;. There will be occasion elsewhere to revert to this name. Marina told us that the mushrooms &#8216;speak&#8217; only in Nahuatl. If she is right, the divinatory mushrooms would seem to be linked irrevocably with the fate of the old language, and doomed to disappear when the old generation fades out.</p>

            <p>For some years Robert Weitlaner had been hearing rumors, which he conveyed to us, that the mushrooms were still being used in the Valley of Toluca about two hours by car from Mexico City, where the altitude is also around 8,000 feet. During our stay in Mexico Donald Leonard, the husband of Carmen Cook, made two trips thither for us, accompanied on one occasion by Don Roberto. They went first to Tenango del Valle, the very town mentioned by Jacinto de la Serna in his account of mushroomic idolatries in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. In the market place of that town they learned from an old woman that two kinds of divinatory mushrooms are still being used thereabouts, the larger known as <i>mujercitas</i> and the smaller as <i>hombrecitos</i>, the little women and little men. Collectively they are called <i>niños</i> or <i>nanácatl</i>. These mushrooms are not exposed in the market place but are obtainable there. The supply comes from a village called San Pedro Tlanixco, only a few miles away, where it seems that the people make a specialty of gathering and preparing these &#8216;children of the waters&#8217;. Mr. Leonard brought back specimens of both kinds.</p>

            <p>Thus thanks to the diligence of the Leonards and Miss Christensen we have discovered the mushroom cult surviving to this day in the very land of the Nahua. Whereas forty years ago W. E. Safford was denying that any such cult had ever existed, we now find it on the door-step of the capital city of Mexico. In the Valley of Toluca the Aztecs overran and superseded the earlier Matlatzinca population, of whom there still exists one village speaking the old tongue, and the region where the people speak Mazahua is hard by. We know from our early quotations that both these peoples knew the mushroom. Where is the anthropologist who will do the study that cries for doing in the Valley of Toluca and thereabouts ? He might well start in San Pedro Tlanixco. Here apparently he would confront a most curious problem in economics, a village that specializes in supplying consumers with a sacred product that never enters the ordinary channels of trade. The student should try to discover the circumstances surrounding the mushroom harvest, attend the drying of them, learn where and how they are stored, and as best he can trace them to the ultimate consumers, recording for us all the associations, religious, social, folkloric, and linguistic, that accompany them on their way. Here is a study in little things pregnant with cultural meaning. Who knows? Perhaps he would discover that some of the product reaches Mexico City itself, and that heavenly workers in its very precincts are still consulting the little children of the waters.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">I</span>n 1949 Dr. Pedro Carrasco, the gifted Mexican anthropologist, visited a number of villages in the coastal sierra of southern Oaxaca, a region almost unknown to travelers. He gave his account of this trip in the paper that he contributed to the Festschrift honoring Dr. Alfonso Caso, which appeared in 1951, and in it he dropped the remark that the villagers were still using the sacred mushrooms, as well as other hallucinogens. One of the goals of our 1955 trip was to repeat Dr. Carrasco&#8217;s visit and amplify his observation. For our guide we engaged once again our friend from the Mije trip, Francisco Ortega, known as Chico, who at our behest made a quick trip to the area early in June to learn whether it was at all accessible in the rainy season. He reported that the trip was feasible, but that the villagers were suspicious of strangers and inhospitable, and that we should not think of going unless we carried letters of commendation to the local authorities from the Governor of the State and the Commanding General of the Military Zone.</p>

            <p>Equipped with these credentials, we set out from the city of Oaxaca on Friday morning, July 15. Our party, in addition to Chico, consisted of our old friend and mentor Robert J. Weitlaner, Professor Howard E. Brunson of the East Los Angeles Junior College, and RGW. In the afternoon of the following day we reached the town of San Agustín Loxicha,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b15-fn2" id="cp5b15-r2">[2]</a></sup> a cluster of houses on a mountain ridge, some 1,700 meters high, that looks south across rugged and verdant terrain to the Pacific Ocean some ten or fifteen miles away. The town is almost due south from Oaxaca and about 100 miles by road and trail. In the rainy season the mornings are usually bright and clear, so clear that the breaking surf can be descried in the distance. But soon the clouds roll in from the sea and the rain is likely to come down in torrents for hours on end. The town is idyllic in its loveliness, almost all of its houses of adobe with roofs either of thatch or homemade shingles beautifully weathered, everything washed clean by the rain, the air pellucid in the morning sun, the whole sparkling community perched as it were in an upper balcony of a vast amphitheater of mountains overlooking the distant Pacific sea. We arrived at the moment when the <i>floripundio</i> was in bloom, a tree arrayed in trumpet-like blooms, dazzling white, that greets the eyes at every turn. This is the angels&#8217; trumpet of Florida, the datura suavaeolens of botanists.</p>

            <p>The people of this area are Zapotecs, speaking one of the several Zapotec languages. But these languages differ much from each other, and Chico, versed in the tongues of the Isthmus and the Valley, could not cope with the speech of San Agustín. There was an element in the village who were hostile to us from the beginning, just as Chico had warned us to expect, and we were glad for the measure of protection that our letters gave us. The hostility grew as the days passed, but the concern that we felt at times for our safety is, in retrospect, merely an incidental phase of travel such as this, and we shall not dwell on the details beyond saying that we were all relieved when we had left the town behind us on Saturday morning, July 23, after we had stayed there one week. All the experience and tact of Don Roberto and Chico had been needed to keep the hostility in bounds.</p>

            <p>In June Chico had made contact with a leading villager of San Agustín, Ismael Jiménez Reyes, a store-keeper and coffee grower, who had promised Chico the cooperation of a <i>compadre</i> of his, a <i>curandero</i> of the first rank, Aristeo Matías by name. We called on Ismael at once. In fluent Spanish he told us that he himself never has recourse to the mushrooms, but he knew much about them by hearsay and he told us all he knew. What he said echoed many things that we had heard in the Mije and Mazatec country, in Miss Pike&#8217;s letter, and in the old books. Like our Mije friends, he said that if a dog barks or if a cock crows nearby, nothing can be expected from a mushroom vigil thus interrupted. Reminding us of the 16<sup>th</sup> century botanist Francisco Hernández, he said that one kind of mushroom makes the eater give himself over to sheer laughter, <i>pura risa</i>. (Later Don Aristeo corrected this. There is no such species, he explained, but any of the divinatory mushrooms can provoke this effect when taken by weaklings or cowards.) Ismael told us a story that reminded us of an episode in Miss Pike&#8217;s letter. On his farm Ismael had once had a hired hand, a <i>mozo</i>, who fell ill. " &#8216;They will never cure me with medicine,&#8217; the <i>mozo</i> said; &#8216;I am going to take me a mushroom.&#8217; And so he did. Then he said, &#8216;Give up hope. I am going to die.&#8217; Still possessed by the mushroom, he added, &#8216;I no longer live&#8217;. &#8216;They have already come, and taken hold of me, and are carrying me away.&#8217; Shortly afterwards he really died. Yes, with the mushrooms he saw how his soul was already being torn from his body. His soul was already in the other world."<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b15-fn3" id="cp5b15-r3">[3]</a></sup> This episode, told to us with moving simplicity by Ismael, serves to illustrate a fact about the use of <a name="divination-8">divinatory mushrooms</a> in Middle America that all our evidence supports. The mushrooms play a major rôle in the folk medicine of the various archaic cultures where they are used, but in native thinking never as therapeutic agents. The Indians use them for diagnosis and prognosis. The mushrooms are expected to reveal the cause, nature, and course of the illness, and if the outlook is not hopeless, to declare what must be done for the patient to recover. Under the spell of the mushrooms, the <i>mozo</i> in the story saw himself die, and he accepted the death verdict. (Of course by modern medical criteria the mushrooms produce a powerful psycho-catharsis with somatic consequences.)</p>

            <p>Aristeo Matías the <i>curandero</i> was working his acres when we arrived in San Agustín. Ismael sent his son-in-law Pedro García to fetch him, first to a <i>rancho</i> three hours below, and then, not finding him there, to another <i>rancho</i> high in the mountains in a different direction and also far away. At last he found Don Aristeo and they arrived back in San Agustín on Sunday evening, joining us where we were all huddled together in Ismael&#8217;s little store. Don Aristeo presented an extraordinary appearance, a little man, clearly weighing less than a hundred pounds, in his fifties, with an expressive little face and almost no teeth. He had no Spanish whatever, and during the long hours that we were to pass with him during the following week, we had as our interpreters Ismael, Pedro, and his own son Serafín. Don Aristeo was an informant of value in the sense that he was a product of his world little touched by outside influences, but his responses were slow, it was difficult for him to grasp the import of our questions, and patience was often needed to arrive at his meaning.</p>

            <p>We told Don Aristeo that we had come from far away to learn the secrets of the sacred mushrooms with the idea that we might take up his vocation, and we asked him also for news about the fate of RGW&#8217;s son Peter. All this seemed reasonable to him, but the Zapotecs are a race notorious for their hypertrophied pocket nerve, and the next day, before we got down to work, Don Aristeo sent us word by Ismael that he would help us for 1,000 pesos. There were further interchanges through our intermediaries Ismael and Cliico, and we finally settled on 500 pesos, or about $40 U.S. How different from the nobility of Cayetano and Guadalupe in the Mazatec country! But when we had once agreed on the price, Don Aristeo kept his bargain, and some days later, on the eve of our departure, we kept ours, paying him off, and our interpreters too, with solemn formality, by the light of a candle, in Ismael&#8217;s store.</p>

            <p>The <i>curandero</i> in San Agustín is called <i>mènjak</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b15-fn4" id="cp5b15-r4">[4]</a></sup>, &#8216;he who knows&#8217;, exactly the same figure of speech that we had found in the Mazatec country. The designation <i>mènjak</i> retains its literal sense, so that instead of <i>mènjak</i>, in the appropriate context one uses <i>sanjak</i>, &#8216;that man knows&#8217;. In speaking Spanish Ismael rendered the Zapotec words by <i>sabio</i>, the wiseman, rather than by <i>curandero</i>. Don Aristeo told us that his father had given him the mushrooms for the first time at the age of 12. His father had been a <i>mènjak</i>, and his father&#8217;s father before him. But his son Serafín showed little promise; alcohol was his undoing. Women are just as good as men in this vocation, perhaps better, he said, for they are not given to alcohol; and he cited one Ebrígida Santiago, in the village, to illustrate his point. The woman who pursues this calling is a <i>ngol&#8217;njak</i>. Don Aristeo said that the beginner must take the mushrooms several times before he can cope with them as a <i>mènjak</i>. &#8216;On taking the mushroom for the first time, the mushroom introduces himself to the novice, <i>Así me llamo yo</i> [&#8217;thus am I called&#8217;; note the parallel with Exodus 3 :i4]. Then terrible things happen, but one must not be afraid. You rush to the sea, you plunge in, you go up to heaven, there where Jesus Christ is, and then to hell where the criminals are. You see the whole world lying in the middle of the sea. On the second try you are thrown into the sea, but be not afraid. Then you see two women and two men who are gathering up the blood where Christ was born [sic]. On the third try everything changes, and now you are strong and the voices begin to come. Then on the fourth try you arrive there where the Virgin Mary is, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and then they explain good things. Then all the Spirits come, all the Virgins, all the Saints. Then you know, and you are <i>mènjak?</i> From that moment the mushroom teaches you all things.&#8217;</p>

            <p>Don Aristeo told us that all the <i>curanderos</i> of the region are known to each other, and that there are three elders among them, of whom he is one. The three take counsel together from time to time, when questions come up, and in difficult cases one of them calls in another, who takes the mushrooms and wrestles with the problem. For four days before taking the mushrooms the <i>mènjak</i> must refrain from alcohol, even beer, and also from sexual relations. But you may eat any food and smoke tobacco. The four day period is called a <i>noven</i>, adapted from the Spanish <i>novena</i>, and you count back from the end of the mushroom session. Thus if the session ends at dawn on Friday, then Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, and Tuesday are the four days, and you begin to observe the régime from Tuesday noon on.</p>

            <p>The word for &#8216;mushroom&#8217; in the Zapotec of San Agustín is <i>mbey</i>, and this appears to be the basic word in all the Zapotec languages. There is no other word to designate the sacred mushrooms, but this function is served in some measure by <i>mbèydó</i>&#8217;, an important and curious term that is a &#8216;collective&#8217;: it means a batch or lot or mess of sacred mushrooms. It is never used for mushrooms other than the sacred ones. The cap or pileus of the mushroom is the <i>yek</i>, &#8216;head&#8217;, the same figure that we have found in the Mije and Mazatec country. The stipe is the &#8216;leg&#8217; and the gills are the &#8216;inside&#8217; of the mushroom.</p>

            <p>Don Aristeo uses four kinds of mushrooms for divinatory purposes. First, there is the <i>piule de churìs</i>, wherein <i>churìs</i> means &#8216;the small ones&#8217;. <i>Piule</i> is a word widely used in Mexico in the vocabulary for the hallucinogens, but its etymology, range, and application seem not to have been a subject of study. In this case the <i>piule de churìs</i> is a mushroom that grows in pastures and cultivated fields. Don Aristeo gave us samples. (Query: Is <i>piule</i> derived from <i>peyotl</i>?)</p>
            
            <p>The second and third kinds are both called <i>piule de barda</i>, wherein <i>barda</i>, &#8216;thorn&#8217;, stands for Christ&#8217;s <a name="crown-of-thorns">crown of thorns</a>. One of these species grows in clumps near but not in marshy ground, and it is black, and it stains the ground and plants nearby with its own blackness. It appears to be abundant, and Don Aristeo had a large supply which he had gathered lately and dried in the sun. The other kind is much larger, rising to six or seven inches in height. It grows in the shallow water of marshy land, singly, and it is much harder to gather in quantity. The upper surface of the cap is bright yellow, but the gills and stipe are dark. To distinguish this from the first, it is called in Spanish the <i>grandote</i>, &#8216;big fellow&#8217;. It is said to appear on the day of St. Anthony, June 13. In the Zapotec country the marshy places are considered holy, and these two kinds of mushrooms are linked with the holy marsh land. They told us that beneath the marsh a great <i>culebra</i> or serpent <i>(mjá&#8217;mdo&#8217;</i> in Zapotec) lives. I asked what it looked like, and they said no one had ever seen it. Thus the belief in the Middle American serpent deities lives on to this day.</p>

            <p>The fourth kind of divinatory mushroom, of which we saw no specimens, is the <i>ndotàn de venado</i>, the Lord of the <a name="deer-4">Deer</a>. While all four kinds can be used in substitution for each other for all purposes, this one is especially good for help in hunting, because you see in your visions where all the animals are, in a great corral, shepherded by the <i>Dueño de Todos los Animales</i>, Lord of all Animals, another survivor of the pre-Columbian divinities of Middle America. According to Don Aristeo, this mushroom is some five inches across, and yellow above and below, growing in dry earth near any ditch, along any roadside, especially in low country.</p>

            <p>Don Aristeo said that the mushrooms were just as potent when dried as fresh and that they keep for months. When there are no mushrooms, the <i>mènjak</i> uses instead either of two kinds of seeds, and by extension the word <i>mbèydó</i>&#8217; embraces a dose of divinatory seeds, just as though they were <i>mbey</i> or mushrooms. This usage indicates that in the thinking of these Zapotecs the rôle of the vegetable hallucinogens is secondary. Both in San Agustín and in the Mazatec country it seems that there is recourse to the seeds or leaves only when the mushrooms are not available. In the Zapotec of San Agustín the two kinds of seeds are called the yellowish piule and the black piule, <i>mèn nàgádz</i> and <i>mèn nàgát</i>; in Spanish, &#8216;the male&#8217; and &#8216;the young lady&#8217;, <i>el macho</i> and <i>la Señorita</i>. We brought back with us seeds and leaves of the second kind, and they were later identified by Joseph Monachino of the New York Botanical Garden as <i>ololiuqui</i>, the famous Aztec hallucinogen known to botanists as rivea corymbosa.</p>

            <p>Early in our visit we asked Don Aristeo to give us a mushroom session, and this he did on the night of Thursday, July 21. Don Roberto called on him that afternoon to pursue further the calendar problem, and found him casting kernels of corn. There was a heap of 51 kernels disposed in little piles, and he went through the casting five times, to learn what fortune he would have with us that night.</p>

            <p>We arrived at Don Aristeo&#8217;s house shortly before nine o&#8217;clock in the evening. We were eight, our <i>mènjak</i>, Don Roberto, Howard Brunson, RGW, and Chico; Ismael, Serafín, and Pedro. The house was on the outskirts of town, down the mountain side, well secluded. It was a typical one-room adobe cottage with thatch roof, no windows, and a door in the middle of the long side. There was a table on the right as one entered, and a wood fire was burning in a circle of stones in front of the table. Don Aristeo&#8217;s place was next to the fire, where he alternately lay and sat <i>onapetate</i> covered with sacks. There was a bench for some of us to sit on, and the rest lay on <i>petates</i> where they pleased. The embers of the fire and a candle were our only illumination.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Slowly the program got under way. Don Aristeo prayed at length under his breath, and then opened a paper wrapping in which he had a large supply of <i>piule de barda</i>. He took out the mushrooms pair by pair, rinsed each pair well in a bowl of water, and placed the clean mushrooms in another empty bowl, praying the while. Having rinsed enough mushrooms, he tied up the rest in the paper wrapping, poured out the water on the ground, and then, pair by pair, took the mushrooms from the second bowl, severed the caps from the stems, placed the caps in the empty bowl, and held the stems in his hand. To our surprise he severed the caps of 25 pair of mushrooms. He explained to us that the stems are never eaten: they are respectfully laid aside and on the following day they are scattered (not buried) in any place off the beaten track where people will not pass.</p>

            <p>Shortly after 9 o&#8217;clock, seated on the sack, he began to chew and then swallow the mushroom caps, scooping them out of the bowl in one big handful after another, seven mouthfuls in all, chewing them at length. By 9.35 he had finished them. He lay down for a time, his head on a rolled blanket. Then he sat up, lighted a cigarette, and spoke conversationally. Toward 10 o&#8217;clock he began to hum, and this became a musical hum, which in turn grew into a chant. He was lying on his right elbow and made sweeping gestures with his left arm. He asked our religion, and we thought it best to say Catholic. Then he said in Zapotec that our son Peter was alive and would return to us, that we should address prayers to St. Augustine, the Holy Virgin, and St. Joseph; and that we should burn votive candles of virgin wax in Oaxaca before the Virgin of Solitude and later make a similar pilgrimage to the Virgin of Guadalupe. He said that Peter was in Vera Cruz, plunged in sadness, living a hidden life, slinking along dark back alleys, and longing to return to us. (No one had thought to tell Don Aristeo that Peter was really in the army in Okinawa.) Shortly before ii o&#8217;clock our <i>mènjak</i> ate the caps of five more pair of mushrooms. His chanting was low and feeble, and of course in Zapotec, but RGW had the impression that the music was identical to what the Seiiora had sung with magisterial authority in the Mazatec country. Don Aristeo reminded us that our primary purpose in consulting him was to learn how to use the mushrooms and become a <i>mènjak</i>, and we on our part did not disabuse him.</p>

            <p>We had known that Don Aristeo would not offer us mushrooms, for he had told us that only the <i>mènjak</i> ate them. As the long night began to pall on us, Don Roberto tried an experiment. He began to ask anthropological questions of our <i>mènjak</i>, such as the Zapotec ideas about the points of the compass. Don Aristeo was far more responsive than he had ever been before, and it seems possible that the mushrooms offer a key to half-remembered things, a key that might be used in anthropological inquiries. But when all is said, it must be admitted that Don Aristeo&#8217;s performance dragged, his vitality seemed low, and we were heavy with sleep. At one o&#8217;clock he told us we could go home. We think he felt the evening was unsuccessful: the initial dose of mushrooms that he took was abnormally large, and he followed it with a booster dose, as though the response was not to his liking. However, we were well pleased with the rich evidence that he had given us of the mushroom cult in this Zapotec area, the fourth cultural area in Middle America where we now know that it survives.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">B</span>ut we have not done with Don Aristeo. In the course of our talks with him he had made a revelation to us that was so startling, so enigmatic in its implications, that we have left our discussion of it to the last.</p>

            <p>Two of our early Spanish authors wrote of the religious observances that accompanied the gathering of the sacred mushrooms. The 16<sup>th</sup> century botanist Francisco Hernández spoke of. the &#8216;night-long vigils, awesome and terrifying&#8217;, that accompanied the quest. Half a century later, Jacinto de la Serna said that the priests spent the whole night in prayer and entreaties before going out at dawn to look for the mushrooms. Our informants in the Mije and Mazatec regions had known of no such religious practices, but Don Aristeo did.</p>

            <p>Our <i>mènjak</i> told us that when he gathered the sacred mushrooms, he would cross himself, kiss the mushrooms seven times, and say in Spanish or Latin (learned by rote, of course) five Pater Nosters, seven Ave Marías, five Credos, and seven Salve Reina Madres. He would place the mushrooms before the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe in his house, and each day during the observance of the <i>noven</i> he would repeat the prayers and wash ceremonially his face, hands, and feet. Thus in Don Aristeo&#8217;s world the pre-Columbian practices recorded by the early Spanish authors reappear, but overlaid with a Christian veneer.</p>

            <p>When the mushrooms of the fourth class, the hunter&#8217;s mushrooms, are consumed, immediately after they are eaten the <i>mènjak</i> places five righted candles on the ground, one at each corner of a square with the fifth in the center. The mushroom tells the <i>mènjak</i> what spot to choose for this purpose, and flowers or leaves are also deposited with the candles. From the way they are disposed, the five candles clearly represent the five cardinal compass points of the Indians&#8217; world &#8212; North, South, East, West, and Zenith &#8212; and are the <i>mènjak&#8217;s</i> compass for discovering the direction of the <a name="deer-5">deer</a>. The <i>mènjak</i> then addresses an invocation to five divinities: to <i>mdìdo&#8217;</i> or the &#8216;<a name="lightning-2">lightning bolt</a>&#8217;, to <i>mdìdà</i> or &#8216;Our Lord&#8217;, to the Divine Pastor, to the Divine Huntsman, and to San Pedro Chapa in the Church of San Pablo Mitla. Only two of these five divinities bear a Christian aspect. (The Divine Pastor belongs to the Middle American pantheon.) Here we discover our first association in Middle America of the sacred mushrooms with the lightning bolt, <i>el rayo.</i></p>

            <p>There is a third rite. Four days after the <i>mènjak</i> gathers any of the divine mushrooms, he returns to the spot where he has found them and with candles and flowers he gives voice to a supplication for an increased yield of mushrooms in the following year. He addresses his prayers to five divinities:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>the earth,</li>
                <li>God the Father Most Holy,</li>
                <li>the Trinity,</li>
                <li>the Great Lightning Bolt that bred [<i>crió</i>] the <i>piule (mdi&#8217;ndó&#8217; pše&#8217; bìul)</i>, and</li>
                <li>the Great Lightning Bolt that put blood into the <i>piule (mdi&#8217;ndo&#8217; bio ren blul).</i>In Spanish: <i>El gran rayo que le echó sangre al piule.</i></li>
            </ol>

            <p>The second and third of this quintet are, clearly, Christian interpolations. Omitting them, we have left a religious explanation, wholly pre-Columbian, for the generation of the divine mushrooms, and that explanation lies in the union of the lightning bolt with the fecund mother earth. As Don Aristeo put it through our interpreters, <i>el rajo es la fuerza de la tierra</i>, the lightning bolt is the earth&#8217;s force.</p>

            <p>Those of our readers who have long memories will recall that in Section 7 we drew attention to the extraordinary range of the archaic belief in lightning as the generative agent for mushrooms. We documented this belief in ancient India, Greece, and Rome, and in modern Kashmir, Persia, and the Pamirs. Outside the Indo-European world, we found it among the Semitic Bedouin, the Chinese, and the Polynesians of New Zealand. Now, thanks to the experienced handling of our difficult informant by Robert Weitlaner, we rediscover this self-same belief in a Zapotec village where the ancient Zapotec culture strongly survives. And in this Zapotec recension we pinpoint it with greater precision than elsewhere: for Don Aristeo and his people the divine mushrooms are the progeny of coitus between the lightning bolt and our mother earth.</p>

            <p>At once the question posed by our evidence assumes new and deeper meaning. Parallels in mythic beliefs among archaic peoples are of course numerous, but is there any other example that is as specific in explaining a simple phenomenon in nature? Plutarch pondered over the very belief that Don Aristeo, the Zapotec <i>mènjak</i>, holds today, and Plutarch&#8217;s puzzlement is as nothing compared with ours, now that we discover the belief even in Middle America. Plutarch asked why men believed that lightning made mushrooms grow. Have we perhaps, at the end of a long trail, discovered the answer?</p>

            <p>No mycologist thinks that lightning causes or encourages mushrooms to grow. It is therefore impermissible to suppose that the various branches of the human family arrived independently at this notion by close attention to nature. (We must not wholly exclude the possibility that the mycologists will change their minds. Scientists are as dogmatic about the knowable as churchmen about the unknowable, but there is a difference: the dogmas of the Church are immutable, whereas men of science change theirs daily without a blush.) Perhaps someone will suggest that just as men of science, unknown to each other, often hit on the same idea at about the same time, so archaic cultures may hit on the same mythic beliefs. But the analogy in its application to our enigma is invalid. Scientists are working in a closely integrated, homogeneous intellectual atmosphere, and even if two workers have never heard of each other, they handle identical data and ideas. But who will assert that cultures far removed from each other in time and space must inevitably, in an early phase of their evolution, link lightning with fungal procreation? Surely independent genesis is highly improbable.</p>

            <p>But how about a simple diffusion of the idea? Today students of the neolithic and later cultures know that cultural communication was active in those early times over large areas. Technological discoveries, artistic and magical motifs, and certain kinds of products would spread quickly to distant parts, thanks to contacts from village to village or to travelers plying the trade routes. The alphabet was invented only once, in the Near East, and by diffusion, that first alphabet led to the birth of scores of alphabets elsewhere. When tobacco was released from the New World, it penetrated everywhere in a few years, faster than explorers and geographers could travel. But was it not always the new idea or gadget that spread thus by diffusion, rather than mythic beliefs as old as the hills? Sometimes with the birth of a new and aggressive religion, its mythology would burst forth like a tidal wave and inundate an area before its strength was spent. But if anyone is bold enough to say that the link between lightning and mushrooms was a belief propagated in this way, at what point in time did the diffusion take place and from what focus?</p>

            <p>There is the third possibility. Was not our belief handed down lineally for many thousands of years? Do we not discover in it a surviving trace of an early cosmology elaborated when the ancestors of the Zapotecs and Greeks and Semites and Polynesians and Chinese were neighbors, were not yet differentiated, in their Eurasian home-land? The Zapotecs link lightning, not with all mushrooms, but only with those that by divine grace translate the eater to Paradise. Perhaps their belief is the original one. On an earlier page we saw how mushrooms as primary tinder were linked with fire, and the procreation of fire with their aid was a divine event and a sexual act. Was it not a natural extension of ideas to suppose that the spark or <a name="spunk-3">spunk</a> of fulminating Jupiter procreated the divine mushrooms? The Zapotecs could have answered Plutarch&#8217;s question, but he clearly had never heard of our miracle-working mushrooms. The popular belief that puzzled him was an archaic survival in Greece that had lost its meaning. If the divine mushrooms were still being used in the <span id="aegean">Aegean</span>, they were the secret of initiates in the mysteries. When myths lose their vitality like molluscs their shells last on, and the figures of speech, the anecdotes, being curious in themselves, inspire popular etymologies, those explanations that are more or less inept after-thoughts. In this way the lightning that had once generated only the divine mushrooms became associated with <a name="truffle-9">truffles</a> and terfezia, with mushrooms generally. The &#8216;<a name="flies-3">fly-mushroom</a>&#8217;, which we think had once harbored the demonic fly of our sacred mushrooms, shrank to an ineffectual insecticide.</p>

            <p>With our Mexican experiences fresh in mind, we re-read what Jochelson and Bogoras had written about the Korjaks and Chukchees. We discovered startling parallels between the use of the <a name="fly-amanita-6">fly amanita</a> in Siberia and the divine mushrooms in Middle America. In Mexico the mushroom &#8216;speaks&#8217; to the eater; in Siberia &#8216;the spirits of the mushrooms&#8217; speak. Just as in Mexico, Jochelson says that among the Korjakst &#8220;the <a name="agaric-6">agaric</a> would tell everyman, even if he were not a shaman, what ailed him when he was sick, or explain a dream to him, or show him the upper world or the underground world, or foretell what would happen to him.&#8221; Just as in Mexico on the following day those who have taken the mushrooms compare their experiences, so in Siberia, according to Jochelson, the Korjaks, "when the intoxication had passed, told whither the &#8216;fly-agaric men&#8217; had taken them, and what they had seen," In Bogoras we discover a link between the lightning-bolt and the mushroom. According to a Chukchee myth, lightning is a One-Sided Man who drags his sister along by her foot. As she bumps along the floor of heaven, the noise of her bumping makes the thunder. Her urine is the rain and she is possessed by the spirits of the fly amanita.</p>

            <p>There must have been a potent reason why from western Europe to <a name="demonic-eskimos-2">Eastern Greenland</a> people have believed down to our own days in the demonic nature of mushrooms, and we think that reason lies in the strange hallucinatory powers of certain species. From <a name="demonic-siberia-3">Eastern Siberia</a> to France these mushrooms are linked with &#8216;flies&#8217;, i.e., the insect world that is itself saturated in demonic <i>mana</i>. Suddenly the Tadzhik myth of the falling &#8216;<a name="lice-2">lice</a>&#8217; which give rise to a crop of mushrooms takes on meaning. Those lice are falling demons, falling &#8216;angels&#8217; if you will, and naturally they yield a crop of demonic mushrooms. And now suddenly Bosch&#8217;s painting of those falling angels as &#8216;flies&#8217; (= lice) takes on fresh meaning. In that left-hand panel of the Hay Wain God sits on a thunderhead, and from the billowing folds of his garments tumble forth the expelled &#8216;angels&#8217; that will yield the crop of demonic growths, where the demonic toads dwell. The Tadzhik myth, the falling &#8216;flies&#8217; of Bosch, the &#8216;flies&#8217; of the Paleo-Siberian tribesmen, all begin to relate themselves to the primitive myths of our own tradition.</p>

            <p>Our divine mushrooms, along with the secondary vegetable hallucinogens, may have played a rôle in the origins of human culture. How the strange virtue of those little children of the lightning must have stirred the soul of early man! Here is our remote ancestor of the Old Stone Age emerging from the mental confines of his animal background, possessed of only the most rudimentary tools and skills, knowing the emotion of fear but not yet acquainted with awe. He discovers the secret of our mushrooms. They produce in him a self-limiting pseudo-psychosis, the fission of his soul. (How cold, condescending, and dubious do such medical labels as &#8216;psychosis&#8217; seem to one who has known the truth of the divine mushroom!) He experiences self-perception. He visits heaven and perhaps hell, he holds the key to the miraculous. Yes, our mushrooms must have unlimbered the imagination of those first men who ate them, stirred their curiosity and speculative faculties. Our mushrooms could have sparked in them the very idea of God. When Don Aurelio and our other friends tell us that the mushrooms translate them to God&#8217;s domain, perhaps this is no modern figure of speech devised for our benefit. The phrase that seems to us fresh and arresting may have been the conventional one for thousands of years. We may be tapping the very well-spring of the religious idea.</p>

            <p>Let us pause for a moment to consider the name that the Nahua gave to the divine mushroom &#8212; <i>teo-nanácatl</i>, God&#8217;s flesh! How those words echo down the centuries of religious experience! (In the Book of Common Prayer, in the Prayer of Humble Access, the faithful are summoned to eat &#8216;the flesh of thy dear son Jesus Christ&#8217;.) The Christian doctrine of Transubstantiation is a hard saying, calling for great faith. (Who was that Saint who, in piety, said that of the miracles there were three above all the rest, the Virgin Birth, Transubstantiation, and, the greatest of the three, the faith given to man that enables him to believe in the other two?) The Mexican Indian with his <i>teo-nanácatl</i> has no need for Transubstantiation because his mushroom speaks for itself. By comparison with the mushroom, the Element in the Christian agape seems pallid. The mushroom holds the key to a mystical union with God, whereas only rare souls can attain similar ecstasy and divine communion by intensive contemplation of the miracle of the Mass. Our Señiora took of two elements, the mushrooms and <i>aguardiente</i>, but the second she withheld from the laity.</p>

            <p>Is not the odd phenomenon of mycophilia vs. mycophobia a latter-day echo of early man&#8217;s shattering experience when he discovered the potent mushrooms, a response, positive and negative, divine and diabolic, to these holy miracle-workers? The toad of our &#8216;toadstool&#8217; is that daemon which the Great Lightning Bolt seeded in the mother earth and which sprang forth in the little mushrooms.</p>

            <p>Our readers will recall that the same word for &#8216;mushroom&#8217; is shared by the Indo-European peoples, the eastern Finnic peoples, the Paleo-Siberian tribes as far as the eastern tip of Siberia, and perhaps even the Eskimos and the Arabs. Do we not now discover the potent secret of the mushrooms that might explain the wide dissemination of a single pre-Indo-European word ? For the cultural historian it becomes imperative that the surviving traces of the mushroom cult among the peripheral peoples of Siberia be minutely and sympathetically examined on the ground by anthropologists and linguists, and likewise the similar use of a mushroom in the interior of New Guinea. It becomes imperative for the anthropologists everywhere to take cognizance of ethno-mycology as an avenue for promising cultural inquiry. In various directions there seem to be fruitful areas for the re-study of ethno-mycological evidence, such as, for example, the strange absence of mushrooms from the immense corpus of ancient Egyptian art and texts. Is this because the Egyptians ignored the fungal world or because Egyptologists have ignored it; In China, long before the Buddhist era, in the Taoist philosophy of Lao-Tse, we discover the theme of the&#160;<i><a name="ling-chih">ling-chih</a></i>:</p>

            <figure>

            </figure>

            <p>wherein &#8216;ling&#8217; means spiritual or potent or <a name="demonic-china">divine</a>, and &#8216;chih&#8217; is a word for &#8216;mushroom&#8217;. According to the legend as it survives today, the&#160;<i>ling-chih</i>&#160;was a mushroom that conferred immortality on the eater. Overlaid in the course of time by the artificialities of Chinese literary and artistic sublimation, this theme must have had its genesis in the country-folk and in a mycological fact. "Was not the divine mushroom of the early Chinese our divine mushroom? Modern commentators such as S. Wells Williams in his&#160;<i>Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language</i>&#160;(1909) report that the&#160;<i>ling-chih</i>&#160;was the fomes fomentarius or fomes igniarius. This could hardly have been so in the beginning, for these hard, bitter tree fungi are inedible; though they could have been ground to a powder and drunk in a potion. Perhaps it is significant that as the source of primary tinder they are linked with fire, and thus with the lightning bolt, and this may explain why they were chosen as evasive substitutes for hallucinatory mushrooms.</p>

            <p>Dr. Hu Shih, alive to our interest in mushrooms, has given us additional evidence of a knowledge of hallucinatory mushrooms in China. In the&#160;<i>Ch&#8217;ing-i lu</i>, usually attributed to T&#8217;ao Ku who lived in the 10<sup>th</sup> century, there is a reference to a mushroom which, when eaten, will cause the disease of the dry laugh.</p>

            <p>The natives call it the&#160;<i><a name="hsiao-i-hu">hsiao-i-hu</a></i>,&#160;which can be translated either by &#8216;Shall-we-laugh?&#8217; or by &#8216;Laugh - What! Not?&#8217; But Dr. Hu tells us that such a name is on its face a literary invention. This mushroom is the &#8216;Laugh-mushroom&#8217;, as it is more commonly called, of which the statesman and writer Yeh Meng-te (A.D. 1077-1148) speaks in the <i>Pi-shu lu-hua</i>, &#8216;Notes of a Summer Vacation&#8217;:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>&#8230;the Maple tree Mushroom which, when eaten, causes the eater to laugh without stopping, and is called the&#160;<i><a name="hsiao-chun">hsiao chün</a></i>.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>or &#8216;Laugh-mushroom&#8217;. What can this be but the mushroom&#160;<i>de pura risa</i>&#160;of our friends Ismael and Don Aristeo, of the botanist Hernández, the&#160;<i><a name="narrenschwamm-2">Narrenschwamm</a></i> of Germany and the&#160;<i>bolond gomba</i>&#160;of Hungary?</p>

            <p>In the Buddhist world there is another clue to explore. According to orthodox tradition, the Buddha died after a Last Supper with his disciples at which he reserved for himself a dish of tender boar&#8217;s flesh, <i>sūkara-maddava</i>. Some have seen not pig but mushrooms on that fateful plate.&#160;<i>Sūkara</i> is cognate with the Latin&#160;<i>sus</i>, English &#8216;<a name="swine-3">swine</a>&#8217;; our readers will recall that&#160;<i>suillus</i>&#160;in Latin is also a fungal name. In Russia there is also a &#8216;swine-mushroom&#8217;, the&#160;<i>svinukha.</i>&#160;In the light of our discoveries, should not this problem in exegesis be re-examined? That the Buddha should have died as a sequel to eating bad pork seems a shocking discord hi the rarefied spirituality of the Buddhist legend. What could be more fitting than for the Master to be translated to Nirvana by the <a name="demonic-buddhist">divine mushroom</a>?</p>
