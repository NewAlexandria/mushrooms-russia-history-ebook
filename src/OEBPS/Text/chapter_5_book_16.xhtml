            the Valley of Mexico</h2>

        <p><span class="initial">I</span>f, as we believe, the hallucinatory mushroom persists even today as a major theme in the emotional and religious lives of many of the more withdrawn Indian peoples of Oaxaca, and if, as we believe, the i6th century writers bear witness to the important role of the mushroom in the Indian cultures as far north as the Valley of Mexico and among the Otomi and Tarascan peoples, it is fair to look for the mushroom also in the archeological evidence of far earlier times. That archeologists have not revealed it to us is not necessarily conclusive &mdash; they have not been on the lookout for it. Furthermore, in spite of the spectacular discoveries made in Middle America by archeologists in the past, what they have done until now may some day seem only a beginning by comparison with the discoveries that he in the future, so many are the major sites that have not been fully explored or even touched.</p>

  <p>There is the further question of the role that the mushroom might be expected to have played in Middle American art. On this <i>a priori</i> opinions are of little value. In Christian art the cross as a symbol is all-pervasive, and it would be natural to look for the mushroom in a similar role. If we are right, the mushroom stones of the early Maya periods in the highlands confirm this analogy. But it does not follow that a major idea always receives corresponding direct emphasis in art. Take for example the Host in the Christian world, the Divine Wafer that is the daily reiteration of the Christian&rsquo;s faith in the miracle of Christ&rsquo;s unique mission on earth. The Mass is the very heart of all Christian liturgy, and the Mass hangs on the elements of Bread and Wine. By comparison with its importance the bread of the Sacrament appears surprisingly seldom in religious paintings. In representations of the Last Supper the faces of Christ and the Apostles take priority over the loaf. For more than a thousand years the best artistic talent was occupied with representing altars, ecclesiastics habited to officiate at Mass, and churches that housed the altar and the Sacrament. All of this pictorial eloquence took for granted the central feature, the miracle of transubstantiation and the Holy Communion. How seldom, relatively, did the artist stop to paint the Host itself! So may it have been with the mushrooms in pre-Columbian Mexico. We may discover its accidental appearance and at the same time begin to sense its constructive presence there where it does not appear.</p>

  <p>In 1954 Mrs. Irmgard Johnson drew our attention to certain mushroomic shapes in the border of the famous Teopancalco (or Teopancaxco) fresco in Teotihuacan. Discovered in 1894, this fresco was carefully copied soon afterwards by Dr. Antonio Penafiel and Miss Adela Breton.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b16-fn1" id="cp5b16-r1">[1]</a></sup> Two pre-Columbian priests facing each other are engaged in a rite, wearing the vestments of their office, their heads burdened with serpent masks. It is supposed that they are pouring <i>pulque</i> on the ground, and if so the rite is associated with inebriation and divine possession. In the center, between the two priests, is a motif of interlaced cords, symbol of the mat <i>(petate)</i> that is in its turn a symbol of authority in Middle America. It is surrounded by a circle of outward pointing triangles, and this design rests on a ceremonial stand. The border consists of a sequence of repeated motifs. On the right hand side are three shapes that look mushroomie, separated from each other by designs that we know represent seashells. The sea-shells are of two kinds, conch and bi-valve.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b16-fn2" id="cp5b16-r2">[2]</a></sup> The shells and the mushroomic shapes stem from a stream of water that flows around the outside border of the fresco. No Americanist has ever suggested that the mushroomic discs are mushrooms and at first the idea seems unlikely. The combination of mushrooms with sea-shells is, <i>a priori,</i> disparate. Why should not these discs be some other sea growth, not yet identified? There seems a further objection to the mushroomic possibility. The &lsquo;stipes&rsquo; of the &lsquo;mushrooms&rsquo;, if we judge by the sea-shells, are simply streamlets from the mother stream, so that we are left with mushroomic discs balanced on the end of these little tributaries. But then we remember that the virtue of the hallucinatory mushrooms resides in the pileus or &lsquo;head&rsquo;, and the stipe is secondary, and these &lsquo;stipes&rsquo; could serve a dual purpose, as stipes and as the umbilical cord through which the life-giving &lsquo;blood&rsquo; (to use the word of our Zapotec <i>curandero)</i> flows into these &lsquo;children of the waters&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>This fresco dates from the period known as Teotihuacan III, extending from c. 300 A.D. to 600 A.D. This was a period rich in cultural achievements. There is no way to determine what language was then spoken in the Valley of Mexico, but it could have been an early form of the classical Nahuatl. The archeological excavations of this period in the Valley have produced large numbers of seashells, and whoever the people were, it is clear that in their ceremonials seashells played a conspicuous, if for us undefined, role. In Plate XLI we have illustrated the accessories of the divinatory mushroom rite as it is practiced today in the Mazatec country: these accessories, for one unfamiliar with Middle American anthropology, make up a disparate lot. If we postulate for the Teotihuacan period a liturgical use of shells with hallucinatory mushrooms, this border becomes intelligible. The fresco itself, according to Seler, invokes the rites of inebriation, which is consonant with our hypothesis of hallucinatory mushrooms.</p>
      

  <p>We examined the Teopancalco fresco in the summer of 1955, and found it sadly deteriorated but with the surviving portions now well protected. On the wall of the little room immediately to the right of our fresco, there had once been another one of which only a stretch of the border survives in good condition, and this border repeats the motif of the one we already know! Mr. Eduardo Noguera has graciously copied it for us, and we publish this design here for the first time. Again the mushroomic meaning suggests itself, tempting but uncertain.</p>

  <p>Dr. Gordon Ekholm has drawn our attention to the identical pattern of motifs in the Tepantitla fresco, dating from the same period and only a mile or so away from the first. This is an elaborate composition sufficiently well preserved for its meaning to be analyzed.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b16-fn3" id="cp5b16-r3">[3]</a></sup> There is a representation of the rain god Tlaloc, and a more aquatic divinity was never portrayed. From his hands drip great drops of water, and a stylized river with star fish and shells flows in both directions from the base of the figure. Beyond the big drops of water, on both sides, from the fingers of other hands drop streamlets of water, and from the side of these streams nearest to the central figure we discover the same series of shell and disc motifs with which we are already familiar. Seeds are scattered on the other side of one of these streamlets. Were these seeds mere symbols of fertility, one would look for kernels of maize among them. But maize is absent. If our surmise about the divine mushrooms is justified, we should expect hallucinatory seeds. The ones in the fresco are diverse, but among them we discover some that forcibly suggest the <i>colorines</i> used with mushrooms for divinatory purposes in the Valley of Mexico to this day. They are red and black, with the hilum, quite properly, in the red field.</p>

  <p>Tlaloc was one of the most popular and important of Mexican deities. He was the god of the waters, of the clouds and mist and sleet and hail, of the lightning bolt, of rain and the streamlets and torrents and rivers and lakes and the ocean. His home, Tlalocan, was thought to be in the verdant uplands, where the clouds would gather and water was abundant. How was Tlaloc related to our mushrooms? Look at the curious pattern that emerges from the philological evidence. We know that today, in this Valley of Mexico where the fresco is, the mushrooms are called in classic Nahuatl <i>apipiltzin,</i> &lsquo;children of the waters&rsquo;, and this name could have embraced the sea-shells too. The name &lsquo;Tlaloc&rsquo; comes from the Nahuatl root <i>tlal,</i> &lsquo;earth&rsquo;, and according to the etymology elaborated by Seler in the work already cited, the god is &lsquo;he who makes things sprout&rsquo;. We recall that in Mazatec the word for the hallucinatory mushrooms means &lsquo;that which springs forth&rsquo;, i. e., &lsquo;sprouts&rsquo; and in Mije we discovered a word for the same mushrooms that carries the same meaning. How felicitous are these names, both mycologically and psychologically, for the divine mushrooms with delphic powers! The very names seem to be translations of&rsquo;Tlaloc&rsquo;. When our Zapotec <i>curandero</i> invokes the Great Lightning Bolt for a larger yield of these mushrooms, is he not invoking Tlaloc? With the lightning bolt Tlaloc engenders the divine mushrooms in <i>tlal,</i> the mother earth. We know that one of the emblems of Tlaloc consisted of three small conches in a triangular sac. What could be more appropriate, now that we perceive the context, than hallucinatory mushrooms alternating with sea-shells in a fresco honoring Tlaloc?</p>

  <p>The fresco of Tepantitla does not consist solely of the figure of Tlaloc. It was the Mexican belief that the souls of those who drowned went directly to Tlalocan, where they passed their days disporting themselves on the playing fields of Paradise. In another panel of the Tepantitla frescos there is a picture of this Paradise. Dr. Caso has described it in detail and we shall not repeat the description here, beyond pointing out that this vision of the Elysian Fields is one of the few lovely and gentle expressions of Middle American artistic genius. We ask ourselves whether it was not inspired by the visions that the mushrooms of Paradise give to those who eat them. There are no mushrooms in this vision, of course, for the key to Paradise is left behind at the entrance.</p>

  <p>The panorama in the fresco of which we are speaking is made up of small figures scattered across the fields, and it must be read detail by detail, pictographically. We shall concentrate on a single vignette. In the lower right hand corner there is a lake replenishing the river of Tlaloc, and from it there emerges the unclothed figure of one who has just died by drowning, the water still gushing from his lungs. Facing toward the left where lie the fields of Paradise, two great tears of nostalgia still falling from his eyes, with a branch of luxuriant foliage in his uplifted right hand, confidently he advances singing an anthem, which is represented by the five-fold scroll emerging from his mouth. Above that scroll is the emblem of Tlaloc (the three-fold sea-shell) and a butterfly, which in Middle America (as in European folklore) is frequently the reincarnation of</p>

  <p>a defunct soul. In the lake, below the human figure, we are delighted to discover, thrice repeated, what we will tentatively call the shell-and-mushroom motif. How fitting that the divine mushrooms should have been present when our hero takes leave of this world to enter the Paradise of Tlaloc!</p>

  <p>Seler found that the stylized features of Tlaloc evolved in the beginning from intertwined serpents, perhaps the very serpents that specialists identify in the headdresses of the priests in the Teopancalco fresco. He also pointed out that the effigies of Tlaloc are often surmounted by a crown of triangular peaks, and with some supporting evidence he ventured the suggestion that these peaks were stylized mountain heights around which the waters of the god would gather. Seler in his work on the Vatican Codex accompanied his exposition with cuts of two such effigies, which we here reproduce. The crowns remind us of the circle of triangular peaks that is an obvious symbol of divinity in the Teopancalco fresco. As others have pointed out, this fresco manifests Maya influence. The Teotihuacan III period, contemporary with classic Maya, was notable for the cultural interchanges that were taking place between the two civilizations. Kidder has shown how the butterfly symbol of the Valley of Mexico at that very time made its appearance in the Highland Maya area.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b16-fn4" id="cp5b16-r4">[4]</a></sup> In the light of these circumstances and particularly the notched crowns of Tlaloc, how startling it is to look again at the notched aureole of the god emerging from the stipe of the Rietberg mushroom stone, reproduced on Plate XLIII! By the Borhegyi dating, the Rietberg artifact would be either late pre-classic high- land Maya, or early classic. And there is that other mushroom stone, much earlier, found at Kaminaljuyu, with the triangular design on the stipe, which we reproduced on page 279. This last one is early pre-classic, c. 1000 B. c.</p>

  <p>The use of the mushrooms distinguished the upland cultures, the very slopes of Tlalocan, the home of Tlaloc, where mushrooms abound. The kinship of sea-shells with mushrooms, which left us at first nonplussed, now seems natural. If we were to postulate mushrooms in pre-Conquest art in Mexico, we would direct our search precisely to frescos dealing with Tlaloc and the Paradise of our mushroomic visions, to the very frescos where we have found mushroomic shapes. The mushrooms here are casual, incidental, like the bread in paintings of the Last Supper. In the notched motif of the Rietberg mushroom stone we may even have hit on a direct link between the mushrooms of the Valley of Mexico and the mushroom stones of the Guatemala highlands.</p>

  <p>The little houses where the Tepantitla and Teopancalco frescos survive may have been two of many where the devout once gathered to receive and consult the divine mushrooms in the sacred purlieus of Teotihuacan. If sea-shells were used in the rites, this explains the large numbers still found in those precincts, within sight of the great pyramids.</p>

  <p>Dr. Borhegyi&rsquo;s chart suggests to us that hallucinatory mushrooms were the focus of a cult in the highland Maya world that goes back at least to early pre-classic times, to B.C. 1000 or earlier, the earliest period when technically such artifacts could be carved in stone. Thus tentatively we trace back the use of the divine mushroom in Middle America to the earliest period from which a record could be expected to survive. Beyond that horizon may we project the mushroom agape back through millennia, to the Eurasian home-land whence our Indians&rsquo; ancestors migrated?</p>

  <p>If the &lsquo;mushroom stones&rsquo; were accessories in a mushroom cult, it is fair to ask why that cult disappeared long ago from the Maya highlands. We do not know, but the social institutions of the Maya world suggest an answer. Let us look again at the Mexican evidence. In the remote Mije country we found that the use of the sacred mushrooms was secular. Everyone there knows the mushrooms, and gathers and uses them. No <i>curandero</i> is needed for them. In the Mazatec country we find a dual cult. There was the superb performance by the Seilora, sharing the mushrooms with her coven and leading it by song and dance; and there was an intricate divinatory rite celebrated by Don Aurelio, with the aid of divers accessories, according to a complicated liturgical sequence. Don Aristeo in the Zapotec country followed the Senora&rsquo;s procedure, but withheld the Element from his congregation. Do we not discern here, in contemporaneous celebrations, the distinct phases of a cult that might mark a chronological evolution and in certain circumstances lead to its extinction &gt; The sacred mushrooms with their miraculous powers could have been bathed in <i>mana</i> from an early time, and become the exclusive privilege of the priesthood, and ultimately of the highest priest-kings. As the mushrooms are not habit forming, there was no popular addiction to them that would have been an obstacle to this trend. When the regime of the priest-kings toppled over, the secret of the mushrooms, like so many other secrets of the Maya theocrats, disappeared with them.</p>
