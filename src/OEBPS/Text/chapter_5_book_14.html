  <p class="calibre1">There are three cultural areas in the world where men consume mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for psychic effects. We have just dealt with one of these - the eating of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fly amanita by the Hyperboreans of Siberia.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The second area is in New Guinea, in the northeastern part of that island,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at the headwaters of the Wahgi River. The practice is reported among the natives</p>

  <p class="calibre1">living in the Mount Hagen range of mountains, but it may well be more wide-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">spread. The Mount Hagen natives are a mixture ethnically of Negritos and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Papuans, with some Melanesian blood. Concerning their use of an intoxicating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom the available evidence is clear but pitifully meager. In 1947 the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">American Ethnographical Society published as its Monograph No. 12 a paper</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by Abraham L. Gitlow entitled 'Economics of the Mount Hagen Tribes'. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">devoted one brief paragraph to intoxicants, and said that one of the three in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">current use was a mushroom called <i class="calibre4">nonda.</i> Then he continued:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The wild mushroom incites fits of frenzy and has even been known to result in death.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is taken before going out to kill an enemy, or in times of anger, sorrow, or excitement.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That is all. We are vouchsafed no information about the mushroom itself,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or its manner of preparation, or the dosage, or the meaning of its native name;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nor any hint of the folk associations that must cling to this potent fungal growth.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How odd that professional anthropologists should so often ignore in this way</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the obvious questions about fungi.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thomas Gilliard, an ornithologist of the American Museum of Natural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">History specializing in the birds of New Guinea, first drew our attention to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mount Hagen reference. He did more: he suggested that we address a letter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to a Catholic missionary working downstream from the Mount Hagen range</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and inquire about a peculiar fungal practice among the natives there. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wahgi is a river that runs east and then south into the Gulf of Papua. Below</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mount Hagen but still far from the sea it drains a valley shut in on the north</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by the Bismarck range and on the south by the Kubor mountains. The natives,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known as the Chimbu people, are linguistically and culturally distinct from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mount Hagen tribesmen, though ethnically similar. It seems that among them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chastity is not prized as a virtue in young unmarried women, and that to avoid</p>

  <p class="calibre1">children they eat a certain fungus. Later, when they marry, they give up the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">215</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_4"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_2">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">fungus and proceed to bear children without let or hindrance. We sent off our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">letter to Father John Nilles, a member of the Society of the Divine Word,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to his station at Mingende, in the Central Highlands of the Territory of New</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Guinea, and in due course his reply confirmed Mr. Gilliard's report:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I know [he wrote] of one kind of mushroom that is used by women as a means of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">preventing conception or procuring abortion. A native has brought me two specimens of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that kind, of which I send you two cross sections. It grows on old tree stumps in the bush</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from 6,000 feet up on the slopes of the Chimbu and Wahgi valleys. When fresh the color</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on top is brown, and white underneath. Small slices are cut off, cooked by the woman</p>

  <p class="calibre1">between hot stones, and eaten with cooked sweet potatoes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On receiving this gracious communication from Father Nilles, we forwarded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mushroom samples at once to Professor Roger Heim in Paris. They were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">insufficient for definitive identification, but Professor Heim felt confident that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the specimens belonged to a genus known in France as ungulina, and probably</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the species called by French mycologists the ungulina auberiana (Mont.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pat. This particular species is abundant throughout the tropics and belongs to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the polypores with rigid trama. It staggers under the burden of twenty or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thirty competing scientific names; in the collections of the New York Bo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tanical Garden the specimens carry the designation rigidoporus microporus.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1 he watershed of the Wahgi, in the light of the tantalizing information at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hand, holds exciting secrets for the exploring ethno-mycologist. But we must</p>

  <p class="calibre1">leave New Guinea behind and turn to Middle America, the third of our areas.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here we discover the most dramatic story in the whole field of ethno-mycology.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There survives to this day in Mexico, within a few hours' flight of New York,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the living cult of a sacred mushroom, a mushroom to which is attributed the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">power of bestowing on the eater extraordinary faculties. We know that this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cult was nourishing when the Spaniards conquered Mexico and we believe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there is evidence indicating that it was then millenniums old. For three centuries</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this cult lay forgotten by the world in the old writings of the i6th and iyth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">centuries, while Indians in remote corners of Mexico continued to believe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the mushroom and practice the cult. Only in the last twenty years has the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cult come to light again, and even today its existence is known to few. After</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we had examined the available evidence old and new, we found ourselves</p>

  <p class="calibre1">succumbing to the spell of the mysterious mushroom with its strange powers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and uncertain identity. The possibilities of further exploration in the field</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drew us more and more, and we proceeded with the pleasant task of laying</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">plans for a trip to the remote Indian tribes of the mountains of Oaxaca. These</p>

  <p class="calibre1">plans we carried out in 1953.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our readers must be patient with us if we develop our story deliberately,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">laying the groundwork for our own inquiries by first assembling the evidence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">previously available - evidence of the highest intrinsic value and not alone for</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">Fig. 12</b></i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">ethno-mycologists. Ten early writers speak of the mushroom cult. We shall</p>

  <p class="calibre1">translate what they had to say, but as the original sources are often hard to come</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by, for the convenience of students we supply these texts in Appendix IV on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pages 404-407, keyed numerically to the translations in the following pages.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those who read Spanish will relish the style of the old authors, terse, supple,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">free of literary artifice, the testimony of witnesses putting down on parchment</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for posterity what they saw and heard and experienced, usually coloring their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">comments with the religious feelings proper to their age. How exciting it is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to exhume from the grave of centuries these almost forgotten voices telling us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the sacred mushroom and the powers attributed to it! This was the age of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Richard Hakluyt, and our quotations belong to the world of exploration and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discovery that we associate with his name.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Montezuma,1 most famous of Aztec kings, assumed his regal office in the year</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1502, and the event was celebrated with exceptional pomp. The Spaniards'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">carvels were already probing the Caribbean, but Cortez' landing at Vera Cruz</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was still seventeen years off. The ceremonies and festivities of the new monarch's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">installation were so spectacular that visitors arrived from far and wide, and even</p>

  <p class="calibre1">certain of Montezuma's traditional enemies, princes of the Tlascalan people,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">came in disguise to witness the great event. They were discovered, but the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">magnanimous Montezuma, instead of exploiting their capture, had them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">royally entertained. After his induction into office, the whole city gave itself</p>

  <p class="calibre1">over to celebrating with night-long dancing. To the Tlascalan princes were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">served the inebriating mushrooms, that they might the better enjoy themselves.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Almost a century later, in 1598, one Fernando de Alvarado Tezozomoc, of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indian blood, composed a <i class="calibre4">Cronica Mexicana.</i> After giving his account of Mon-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tezuma's anointing in his chapter 87, he goes on:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[i]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">... To the strangers they gave woodland mushrooms on which they got drunk, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thereupon they entered upon the dance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tezozomoc's account is sparing in details. Almost twenty years earlier a Domi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nican friar, Diego Duran by name and a mestizo by blood, had written his</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Historia de las Indias de Nueva Espana,</i> in which the more loquacious cleric gave</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his account of the same episode:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[2]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The sacrifice finished, and the steps of the temple and court remaining bathed in human</p>

  <p class="calibre1">blood, they all went off to eat raw mushrooms, on which food they all lost their senses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and ended up in a state worse than if they had drunk much wine; so drunk and senseless</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were they that many of them took their own lives, and by dint of those mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they saw visions and the future was revealed unto them, the Devil speaking to them in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that drunken state.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Both Tezozomoc and Duran seem to have relied on a single source, now</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lost to us. Neither described the mushroom nor gave it a name, though we learn</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that it was associated with the woods and that it was eaten raw. Furthermore,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">through the friar's priestly bias and exaggeration one perceives an important</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fact: the mushroom was more than an intoxicant, for to it were attributed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">divinatory powers and these powers were thought by the Catholic chronicler</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to stem from Satan. How strange that Gitlow in his New Guinea observations</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should have similarly mentioned a fungal frenzy that led even to suicide.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our third witness is Toribio de Benavente called Motolinia, a Franciscan friar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who died in 1569. He was the author of a work whose lengthy title begins</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thus: <i class="calibre4">Ritos antiguos, sacrificios e idolatnas de los Indios de la Nueva Espana,</i> and in it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he gave further details about the extraordinary mushroom. Perhaps one senses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">behind his words the same lost source on whom the other writers relied, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he ends his account with words that could only have had horrifying connota-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tions for the believing Spaniard of the i6th century, for he says that the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room in the Indians' religion played the role of the Host in Christian rites:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[3]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They possessed another method of intoxication, which sharpened their cruelty: for it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they used certain mushrooms or small toadstools, for such there are in this land even as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Castile; but those of this land are in such wise that, eaten raw and by reason of their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bitterness, [the Indians] drink after them or eat with them some bees' honey; and shortly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thereafter they would see a thousand visions and especially snakes; and as they completely</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lost their senses, it would seem to them that their legs and body were full of worms eating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them alive, and thus half raving they would go forth from their houses, wanting someone</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to kill them; and by reason of this bestial drunkenness and travail that they underwent, it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">could happen on occasion that someone would hang himself, and furthermore toward</p>

  <p class="calibre1">others they would be more cruel. They called these mushrooms in their language <i class="calibre4">teuna-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">macatlth,</i> which means 'God's flesh', or of the Devil whom they worshipped, and in this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wise with that bitter victual by their cruel God were they houseled.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Motolinia informs us that the inebriating mushroom is small, bitter, and quick</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to act. He tells us also the name in Nahuatl of the mushroom, and the meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of that name as he understood it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our fourth witness was, as it happens, a sworn witness in a judicial proceeding.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">What is more - and this is significant in delimiting the cultural areas where the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inebriating mushroom was in use - we are now transported to the Mixtec</p>

  <p class="calibre1">country. The Indians of the land that the world calls Mexico have always</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been divided among many cultures speaking utterly unrelated languages. At</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the time of the Conquest the dominant language was Nahuatl and the various</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tribes speaking it may be called collectively the Nahua; of these the politically</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dominant tribe was the Aztec. The Mixtec country lies far to the south of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">valley of Mexico, in what is today the state of Oaxaca, on the road to the Zapotec</p>

  <p class="calibre1">country and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. But linguistically the Mixtecs are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unrelated to the Nahua and distinct from the Zapotecs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On October 15, 1544, in the town of Etlantongo, Esteban Marban, Scribe and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Notary Public in the service of their Majesties of Spain, was taking depositions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in a case involving the alleged apostasy of three notables, all of them Indians,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">principal men of Yanhuitlan, Don Domingo the Cacique and the two <i class="calibre4">Gober-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">nadores,</i> Don Francisco and Don Juan. It seems that, according to report, with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'diabolic ostentation' for many years they had persisted in invoking their idols</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and demons after the manner of their ancestors, with all the idolatrous trappings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the old religion. The crux of their offense lay in the fact that they had been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">219</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_8"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_4">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">baptized in 1527 and they were therefore apostates. The depositions in this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">case survive, and lengthy extracts were published in 1940 by the Museo Nacional</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Mexico as an appendix to one section of the Codex of Yanhuitlan, in an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">edition of this manuscript edited by Wigberto Jimenez Moreno and Salvador</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mateos Higuera. The witness that interests us was one Don Diego, Cacique of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the town of Etlantongo, and we note that an interpreter served him: Don</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Diego must have been at home only in his native Mixtec tongue. After lengthy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">testimony that we would call hearsay, Don Diego continues:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[4]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">. . . and [the witness] knows and saw that some 14 years since, in a fiesta he saw said</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Francisco and Don Juan drunk, and that they had taken <i class="calibre4">nanacates</i> in order to invoke</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Devil as their forbears had done, and that it is common knowledge and notorious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that whenever it does not rain or when the maize is gathered in, they cry out to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Devil, and when they gather in the maize, they hold their drunken parties.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Nanacate</i> is the hispanicized form of the Nahuatl <i class="calibre4">nandcatl,</i> 'mushrooms'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our fifth witness is one Gaspar de Covarrubias, Governor of the mines of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Temazcaltepec, reporting in 1579 on conditions in his area in a document known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the <i class="calibre4">Relation de las Minas de Temazcaltepec.1</i> The working of the mines under</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Spaniards had led to an influx of Nahuatl speakers, but Don Gaspar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">expressly says that the tongue of the native-born population was <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">matalpnga,</b></i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">i.e., Matlatzinca, which today we identify with the Otomi group of languages.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our informant says that in the old days, when the people were still heathen,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[5]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">. . . they were wont to pay in tribute [to the Lord of Mexico], whenever they were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">asked to do so, two or three loads of hempen blankets, which are made from, a tree</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that is called <i class="calibre4">maguei,</i> and they would give mushrooms on which people get drunk,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and <i class="calibre4">ocote</i> . . .</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Additional curious evidence turns up in our sixth source, a book printed in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mexico in 1637 entitled <i class="calibre4">Doctrina y Ensenan$a en laLengua Mazahua de Cosas muy</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Utiles, y Provechosas para los Ministros de Doctrina,</i> written by the Licentiate Don</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Diego de Nagera (or Najera) Yanguas, incumbent of Xocotitlan. This is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">manual for the clergy working among the Indians speaking the Mazahua</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tongue, which belongs to the Otomi linguistic family. It gives in Spanish and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mazahua, in parallel columns, the questions that a father confessor directs to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our seventh witness belongs in a different class. Francisco Hernandez, a botanist,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">went out to Mexico in the year 1570 to study and describe the flora of that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">new world. He devoted seven years to the undertaking, returning in 1577 to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spain with an immense manuscript. Much of it got copied and printed and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">published in three divergent editions, but the manuscript was lost in a fire in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Escorial without ever being properly edited. Hernandez seems to have devoted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">only a brief section to the mushrooms. We find this passage in Volume II of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his <i class="calibre4">Opera</i> brought out in Madrid in 1790, as Chapter 95 of Book IX of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Historia Plantamm Novce Hispanicz.</i> Alone among our witnesses, Hernandez</p>

  <p class="calibre1">might be expected to focus attention on the appearance of the sacred mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and what he says is significant though tantalizingly inadequate. He clearly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speaks, not of one, but of three species of mushrooms that either cause psychic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">symptoms or are clothed in a halo of supernatural associations. The <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">teyhuinti</b></i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">provoke uncontrolled laughter. Another kind conjures up spectacles of war or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the likeness of demons. The search for the third species, bespoken for the tables</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_5">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">of the rich and mighty, is attended by all-night vigils, and the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">themselves are saturated in what the anthropologists today call <i class="calibre4">mana.</i> In his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">manuscript Hernandez included illustrations of his mushrooms, but alas! those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">precious illustrations were apparently lost in the Escorial fire. After</p>

  <p class="calibre1">describing a lethal species named <i class="calibre4">dtlalnanacame,</i> Hernandez goes on:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[7]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">. . . others when eaten cause not death but madness that on occasions is lasting, of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which the symptom is a kind of uncontrolled laughter. Usually called <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">teyhuinti,</b></i> these are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">deep yellow, acrid, and of a not displeasing freshness. There are others again which,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">without inducing laughter, bring before the eyes all kinds of things, such as wars and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">likeness of demons. Yet others are there not less desired by princes for their fiestas and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">banquets, of great price. With night-long vigils are they sought, awesome and terrifying.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This kind is tawny and somewhat acrid.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our eighth and leading witness is the Franciscan friar, Bernardino de Sahagun,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who by reason of his moral and intellectual qualities towers over all his contem-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">poraries who were writing about Mexico in the i6th century. He devoted his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">many years in Mexico, from 1529 to 1590, to the systematic and sympathetic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">study of the Indians among whom he lived and labored. He was the editor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and author of an immense work, a major historical document, the <i class="calibre4">Historia</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">General de las Cosas de Nueva Espana.</i> Published in Spanish in several editions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and translated also into French and English, this source is familiar to all historians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">interested in Mexican culture and the Conquest. Despite its standing as a classic,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there is one fact about this book that is sometimes forgotten. It was a bilingual</p>

  <p class="calibre1">composition, being composed in parallel Nahuatl and Spanish texts. The two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">texts, while parallel, are not identical. The Nahuatl version preserves the very</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words of the native informants as they spoke with Fray Bernardino, and to it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">priority should be given over the Spanish text. There are four brief passages in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sahagun where the inebriating mushrooms figure. The Nahuatl recension</p>

  <p class="calibre1">differs sufficiently to justify us in offering it, as well as the Spanish text, to our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">readers, especially as the Nahuatl passages have remained until now hidden</p>

  <p class="calibre1">behind their linguistic barrier. For locating and translating the Nahuatl passages</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we are greatly indebted to Professor Charles E. Dibble of the University of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Utah, to Dr. Arthur J. O. Anderson of the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and to Miguel Barrios of Mexico City.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From the sources already quoted it is clear that the Indians regarded their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inebriating mushrooms with reverence, and this called down on their heads</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the execrations of professional Christians. The unintentional effect of these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">222</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">denunciations is perhaps to whet the reader's appetite for the mysterious fungi.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sahagun's Indian informants were doubtless baptized, and perhaps for this reason</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or perhaps because of the artful simplicity of Fray Bernardino himself, they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scarcely link the mushroom with native religious beliefs or divinatory prac-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tices, and the hallucinations that they attribute to the eating of mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are so horrible for the most part that one asks why anyone should ever have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been tempted by them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We shall now offer the four quotations from Sahagun, each of them in dupli-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cate, the translation from the Spanish version followed by the translation from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Nahuatl. The first and longest describes a mushroom party. Merchants have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">returned from a long and successful journey and they are giving the party to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">celebrate their success. While the text itself does not hint at religious associa-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tions and certainly precludes priestly direction, the context in Book IX is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">saturated with supernatural beliefs and practices, and leaves the attentive reader</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in no doubt that the mushroom gathering itself was similarly instinct with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">divine presence.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[8 A. <i class="calibre4">From the Spanish]</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The first thing eaten at the gathering were certain black little mushrooms, which they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">call <i class="calibre4">nandcatl,</i> which inebriate and cause hallucinations, and even excite lust. These they ate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">before dawn, and they also drank cacao before dawn. The mushrooms they ate with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">honey, and when they began to get heated from them, they began to dance, and some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sang and some wept, for now were they drunk from the mushrooms. And some cared</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not to sing, but would sit down in their rooms, and stayed there pensive-like. And some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">saw in a vision that they were dying, and they wept, and others saw in a vision that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">some wild beast was eating them, others saw in a vision that they were taking captives</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in war, others saw in a vision that they were to be rich, others saw in a vision that they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were to own many slaves, others saw in a vision that they were to commit adultery</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and that their heads were to be bashed in therefor, others saw in a vision that they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were to steal something, wherefore their heads were to be bashed in, others saw in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vision that they were to kill someone, wherefore they were to be killed, others saw in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a vision that they were drowning in water, others saw in a vision that they would live</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and die in peace, others saw in a vision that they were falling from on high and would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">die from the fall. All the disastrous happenings that are wont to happen, these they saw</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in visions. Others saw themselves sinking in water as in a vortex. Then when the drun-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kenness of the mushrooms had passed, they spoke one with another about the visions that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they had seen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[8B. <i class="calibre4">From the Nahuatl]</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Coming at the very first, at the time of feasting, they ate mushrooms when, as they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">said, it was the hour of the blowing of flutes. Not yet did they partake of food; they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drank only chocolate during the night. And they ate mushrooms with honey. When</p>

  <p class="calibre1">223</p>

  <p class="calibre1">C H A P T E R F I V E</p>

  <p class="calibre1">already the mushrooms were taking effect, there was dancing, there was weeping. And</p>

  <p class="calibre1">some still in their right senses sat in their places leaning against their houses; there they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">merely sit, nodding their heads. Some saw in a vision that already they would die [so]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they sat weeping. Some saw in a vision that they would die in war. Some saw in a vision</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that they would be devoured by wild beasts. Some saw in a vision that they would take</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the enemy captive in war. Some saw in a vision that they would become rich, wealthy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some saw in a vision that they would buy slaves, would become slave owners. Some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">saw in a vision that they would commit adultery [and so] would have their heads bashed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in, would be stoned to death. Some saw in a vision that they would steal; [so] also would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they be stoned to death. Some saw in a vision that their heads would be crushed with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a stone, would be imprisoned. Some saw in a vision that they would perish in the water.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some saw in a vision that they would pass to tranquillity in death. Some saw in a vision</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that they would fall from the housetop, tumble to their death. All such things would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">happen to them at this time; all such things they saw, or else they sank into oblivion.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And when [the effect of] the mushrooms ceased, they conversed one with another, spoke</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of what they had seen in visions.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sahagun tells us that the <i class="calibre4">nandcatl</i> were small and black; that the Indians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">indulged in them in gatherings assembled for the purpose; and that the intoxicat-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing effects were generally unpleasant for the eaters, which we may doubt. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spanish text says that they excited lust, an observation calculated to tease the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">16th century Spaniards, but this observation is missing in the Nahuatl version.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sahagun's second and third references to the inebriating mushrooms occur</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in passages primarily concerned with <i class="calibre4">peiotl</i> or 'peyote', the cactus product long</p>

  <p class="calibre1">used by certain Indians for its psychic and other effects, and in recent years an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">object of intensive study and discussion among anthropologists, biological</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chemists, psychologists, neurologists, and even literary thinkers like Aldous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Huxley. The use of peyote was endemic among the Indians of Mexico north</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Valley of Mexico and of what is now the Southwest of the United States.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sahagun composed his work primarily from within the framework of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nahua culture with its cultural center in the Valley of Mexico. In the passages</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that we are about to give, he is speaking of the northern Indians, known to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nahua collectively as the Chichimecas, a term applied to nomadic Indians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">generally. The Chichimecas, whatever the language or tribe, were hunters and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">food-gatherers, nomads, savages to be feared and also despised. Among them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there were some, such as the people now known as Otomi, who in historic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times had become settled on the land; but they were still by habit called 'Chi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chimecas'. To distinguish them from the true nomads, the latter were called</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tRe 'genuine' or Teochichimecas. While there is some ambiguity in the following</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quotations, we think that, carefully studied, they yield a sensible meaning only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">224</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">if we understand Sahagun as describing the use of peyote among the Northern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nomads, and comparing that use with the use of inebriating mushrooms among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Aztecs. It is as though the Aztec compilers were saying, "The Chichimecas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have their peyote just as we have our mushrooms." This interpretation, which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we accept, was offered to us as a tentative suggestion by Dr. Anderson. If it is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">right, then apparently the northern limit of the use of the inebriating mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was roughly the Valley of Mexico and the Nahua civilization.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[9A. <i class="calibre4">From the Spanish]</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">[The Teochichimecas] also possessed great knowledge of herbs and roots, and knew</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their properties and virtues: It was they who discovered and first used the root they call</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">peyotl,</i> and those who ate and took it, made it serve in place of wine and in place of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what are called <i class="calibre4">nanacatl</i> [?], which are the evil mushrooms that inebriate just like wine.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And they would gather together on a level spot after having drunk and eat, where they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would dance and sing a night and a day, according to their pleasure, and this for one day,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for on the morrow they wept much, and they would say that they were cleansing and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">washing their eyes and faces with their tears.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[IOA. <i class="calibre4">From the Spanish]</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is another herb, like earth's testicles [truffles], which is called peyotl. It is white</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and grows in the direction of the north. Those who eat and drink it see frightful visions,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or laughable ones. This state of drunkenness lasts two or three days and then goes away...</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[pB. <i class="calibre4">From the Nahnatl]</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">And the Teochichimecas had knowledge of the herbs, the roots; how they were, how</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they propagated. These people discovered the so-called peyote. They esteemed it in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">place of wine or mushrooms [?]. They gathered somewhere, assembled on the plain.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At that place there was song and dance all night and all day. And on the morrow once</p>

  <p class="calibre1">again they gathered; wept, wept copiously. It was said their faces were washed. With</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their tears they cleansed their eyes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[IOB. <i class="calibre4">From the Nahuatl]</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Peyote: this peyote is white and it grows only in the land of the Chichimecas, the land</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the god MixcoatJ, which is called the land of the dead north. Whoever eats or drinks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of it becomes intoxicated as if by mushrooms. Likewise he sees many things which are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">frightening or laughable. Perhaps one day or two days he is intoxicated . . .</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The fourth and final passage in Sahagun is the most interesting of all. Here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he calls the inebriating mushroom by the name that Motolinia used-teo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">nandcatl</i> - which in its first element carries the religious association that Sahagun</p>

  <p class="calibre1">avoided elsewhere. Here the mushroom is described in some detail, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nahuatl text is much longer and more interesting than the rather arid Spanish:</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_6">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">[HA. <i class="calibre4">From the Spanish]</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In this land there are certain little mushrooms that are called <i class="calibre4">teonanacatl.</i> They grow</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beneath the grass in fields or moors. They are round, have a long little stem, thin and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">round. When eaten they have a bad taste, hurt the throat, and inebriate. They are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">medicinal for fevers and the gout. Only two or three are to be eaten, not more: those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who eat them see visions and feel palpitations of the heart. The mushrooms incite lust</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in those who eat many, or even be they few. To wild or mischievous youngsters people</p>

  <p class="calibre1">say that they have eaten <i class="calibre4">nanacatl.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">[IIB. <i class="calibre4">From the Nahuatl]</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">One mushroom is called <i class="calibre4">teo-nanacatl.</i> It grows in the waste places, under the grass.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The cap is round, the stem is elongated. By its bitterness it hurts, it hurts the throat. It</p>

  <p class="calibre1">intoxicates one, makes one dizzy, makes one violent. It helps in fevers, gout. Only two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or three are to be eaten. It makes one suffer, causes affliction, makes one restless, causes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one to flee, frightens one, makes one hide. He who eats many, many things sees. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terrifies people, makes them laugh. He strangles himself, hurls himself from high places,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cries out, is afraid. When he eats it in honey he says, I eat mushrooms, I bemushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">myself. Of the boaster, the braggart, the vain one it is said, "He bemushrooms himself."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So far we have quoted only from i6th century sources. Our ninth witness</p>

  <p class="calibre1">belonged to a later generation. He is Jacinto de la Serna, a cleric who in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the middle of the iyth century composed a guide for clergy ministering to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indians. His work was entitled <i class="calibre4">Manuel de Ministros de Indies para el Cono-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">cimiento de sus Idolatnas y Extirpation de Ellas.</i> He was a garrulous busybody,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">zealous in rooting out and extirpating all expressions of the Indians' old religion,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and eager in his narrative to leave a record of his own zeal. Chapter IV of his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">work continues a recital of incidents that had happened to the author proving</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(as he says) that idolatry was still rampant among the Indians in his own time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Section 3 of this chapter lie is discussing native physicians and midwives,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">especially the role of 'witchcraft' in their practices, and certain goings on in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">own household that had aroused his liveliest suspicions. A certain Indian,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">master of the native lore, had lately arrived in the village and had officiated at a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">religious rite in which the intoxicating mushrooms had been a central feature.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The description of the religious ceremony reaches us through Don Jacinto</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by hearsay only, as of course he was not present, but it carries a ring of authen-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ticity, and reminds us of the stirring words with which Motolinia ended his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">observations on the mushroom:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[12]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And what happened was that there had come to [the village] an Indian, a native of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">village of Tenango, great maestro of superstitions, and his name was Juan Chichiton,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">226</p>

  <p class="calibre1">T H E S A C R E D M U S H R O O M S O F T H E N A H U A</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which means 'little dog', and he had brought the red-colored mushrooms that are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gathered in the uplands, and with them he had committed a great idolatry, and before</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I tell of it, I wish to describe the property of said mushrooms, which are called in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mexican language <i class="calibre4">Quautlannamacatl,</i> and having consulted the Licenciate Don Pedro</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ponce de Leon, the great Minister and Master of Masters as I said in Chapter II, he told</p>

  <p class="calibre1">me that these mushrooms were small and golden, and to gather them it was the custom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the priests and old men deputized as ministers for this kind of humbuggery to go up</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into the mountain, and they remained almost the whole night in prayer and superstitious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">entreaties, and at dawn, when there sprang up a certain breeze that they knew, then</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they gathered the mushrooms, attributing divinity to them, possessing as they did the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same effect as <i class="calibre4">ololiuqui</i> [rivea corymbosa (L.) Hallier filius] or <i class="calibre4">peyote</i> [Lophophora</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Williamsii (Lem.) Coulter], because whether eaten or drunk, it intoxicates them and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">deprives them of their senses, and makes them believe a thousand foolish things. And</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so this Juan Chichiton, having gathered the mushrooms on a certain night, in the house</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where everyone had gathered on the occasion of a saint's feast, the saint was on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">altar, and the mushrooms with <i class="calibre4">pulque</i> and a fire beneath the altar, the <i class="calibre4">teponastli</i> [a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">percussion instrument peculiar to the Aztecs] and singing going on the whole night</p>

  <p class="calibre1">through, after most of the night had passed, said Juan Chichiton, who was the priest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for that solemn rite, to all those present at the fiesta gave the mushrooms to eat, after the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">manner of Communion, and gave them <i class="calibre4">pulque</i> to drink, and finished off the festivities</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with an abundance of <i class="calibre4">pulque,</i> so that what with the mushrooms on the one hand and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pulque on the other, they all went out of their heads, a shame it was to see.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Jacinto goes on to relate how he had made utmost efforts to ferret out</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and lay his hands on Chichiton. There was a hot chase, but by the skin of his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">teeth the 'Little Dog' had eluded his pursuer's clutches - to the considerable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">relief of the modern reader, who hopes that Chichiton lived to preside over</p>

  <p class="calibre1">many another mushroomic agape.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our tenth and final source is French: the <i class="calibre4">Histoyre du Mechique,</i> written by An-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dre Thevet not later than 1574. His text is a translation or paraphrase of a lost</p>

  <p class="calibre1">work, <i class="calibre4">Antiguedades Mexicanas,</i> written about 1543 by the Spanish cleric Andres</p>

  <p class="calibre1">de Olmos. The historian is speaking of events that had taken place in the middle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the 15th century, and thus he is placing the use of our mushrooms earlier</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than any of our other sources, and he places them in an Otomi context. Thevet's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our ten documentary sources treating of the divine mushrooms are sup-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ported by other linguistic evidence. There are several early lexicons to cite. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">year 1571 saw the publication in Mexico of a Nahuatl dictionary, <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">Vocabulario</b> en</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">lengua castellana y mexicana,</i> compiled by Alonso de Molina. In its pages we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover under <i class="calibre4">hongo</i> a series of names for mushrooms that inebriate, <i class="calibre4">hongos que</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">emborrachan</i> or <i class="calibre4">que embeodan.</i> Here are these words, with their literal translation:</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">xochi nanacatl:</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">'flower mushrooms'</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tepexi nanacatl:</i> 'cliff mushrooms'</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ixtlauacan nanacatl:</i> 'savannah mushrooms'</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ma$auacan nanacatl:</i> 'mushrooms of the stag's places'</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">teyuinti nanacatl:</i> 'mushrooms of the divine inebriation',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with <i class="calibre4">te-</i> derived from <i class="calibre4">teotl,</i> 'god', and <i class="calibre4">-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">yuinti</i> from <i class="calibre4">yuintia,</i> 'inebriation'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Molina, born in Spain, arrived with his parents in Mexico in 1523 and after</p>

  <p class="calibre1">learning Nahuatl served the Franciscan friars as interpreter. We know not how</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reliable his mushroom names are. Hernandez, as we have seen, also mentions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4">teyuinti,</i> but neither Hernandez nor Molina uses <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">teo-nandcatl,</b></i> which we find</p>

  <p class="calibre1">only in Sahagun and Motolinia.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">More interesting for us than Molina's work is a Zapotec lexicon, <i class="calibre4">Vocabulario</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Castellano-Zapoteco,</i> compiled by Fray Juan de Cordoba and published in 1578</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Mexico. In it we find the words <i class="calibre4">pea$6o, peya$6o,</i> which he defines as <i class="calibre4">honguillo</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">o xeta con que se emborracha,</i> 'little mushroom or toadstool on which one gets</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drunk'. (The accents on his words appear to represent glottal stops.) Under</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">xeta</i> he reports an intoxicating mushroom that grows in trees, which he calls</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">nocuana peneeche,</i> a designation that the Zapotec of today fails to recognize.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here then is proof that the inebriating mushroom was familiar to the Zapotecs,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and thus we establish as a minimum range for the use of the inebriating mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room an area that includes the Nahua and Otomi peoples, the Mixtecs, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">southeastward to the Zapotecs of the Valley of Oaxaca and probably the Isthmus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Tehuantepec. If our interpretation of Sahagun is right, the use of the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. Pedro Carrasco reports that in old Otomi lexicons, under <i class="calibre4">hongo,</i> there are names for the inebriating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms. This would support the testimony concerning the Otomies that we have quoted in our text.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">See Carrasco's <i class="calibre4">Los Otomies,</i> Mexico, 1950, p. 230. We have had no access to these lexicons. All old dictionaries</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the Indian languages of Mexico and Guatemala should be combed for such references.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">replaced by the peyote of cactus origin. To the southward we cannot define</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the boundaries. Our information about the important Zapotecs is relatively</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Fig. 1^.</i> THE MUSHROOM CULT IN l6th AND lyth CENTURIES</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Linguistic areas where contemporary reports establish use of divinatory mushrooms. As modern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence indicates that the cult prevails only in uplands, all contours below, say, 600 meters should</p>

  <p class="calibre1">probably be excluded. Conversely, upland areas such as Mazatec and Chatino as to which early evi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dence is lacking undoubtedly used the mushroom. Northern limits are quite definitely fixed, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eastern limits in Chiapas are uncertain.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rich, by comparison with the complicated mosaic of other Indian cultures on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all sides of them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But there are a few other old lexicons that document the use of our mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms. Some years ago Walter Miller discovered the manuscript of an early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mije dictionary in the Mije village of San Lucas Camotlan. It now lies in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Museo Nacional. In it 'the little mushroom with which people get drunk', <i class="calibre4">el</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">honguitto</b> con que se emborrachan,</i> is rendered by the Mije word <i class="calibre4">maxmux.</i> The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">manuscript may date from the i8th century. A Tarascan lexicon composed by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Fray-Maturino Gilberti and published in 1559 translates 'the mushroom that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inebriates' by the expression <i class="calibre4">cauiqua terequa,</i> wherein the second element means</p>

  <p class="calibre1">229</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_16"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_8">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">'mushroom'. The Tarascans live in Michoacan, to the west of Mexico City. Al-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ready we have placed the mushrooms in the Matlatzinca country: our previous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence is confirmed by the Matlatzinca lexicon of Fray Diego Basalenque,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dated 1642, a manuscript copy of which belongs to the John Carter Brown</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Library in Providence, R. I. The inebriating mushroom is the <i class="calibre4">intza chohui,</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we discover that <i class="calibre4">chohui</i> means both 'mushroom' and apparently 'fiesta'!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now we come to evidence of a wholly different character. We believe that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we detect in the subtleties of Nahuatl grammar a clear expression of the awe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in which the divine mushroom was held. Let us examine that term <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">teo-nandcatl,</b></i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">used by Sahagiin and Motolinia. The initial element <i class="calibre4">teo-</i> carries in Nahuatl</p>

  <p class="calibre1">three distinct meanings. It can signify simply 'great' or 'important'. It may</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mean 'genuine' or 'real', as in <i class="calibre4">Teo-chichimecas.</i> It is derived from <i class="calibre4">teotl,</i> 'god',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and may mean 'divine' or 'sacred'; <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">teo-nandcatl</b></i> means unquestionably the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'sacred mushrooms'. <i class="calibre4">Nandcatl,</i> in turn, is formed by a duplication of the initial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">syllable of <i class="calibre4">ndcatl,</i> 'flesh'. Thus mushrooms are called 'flesh' in Nahuatl, assum-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing however the plural form <i class="calibre4">nandcatL</i> This particular fungal metaphor has its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">analogy in the Pashto language of Afghanistan, where there is a word for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'mushroom', <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">poczl&amp;i</b> (potsakdi)</i> that is a feminine variation of <i class="calibre4">potsdkai,</i> meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'soft flesh' such as the flesh of the ear lobe. (Of course we do not suggest a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">genetic kinship between these metaphors, but when we think that we have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">come upon a simple figure of speech in a fungal vocabulary, it is reassuring to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover that the same association of ideas has occurred to other peoples.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The figure of speech in <i class="calibre4">teo-nandcatl</i> was a living one in the i6th century, for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Motolinia translates the term as <i class="calibre4">came de dies,</i> 'god's flesh', and then immediately</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this good Catholic offers his own substitute, <i class="calibre4">came del demonio,</i> 'Satan's flesh',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thus illustrating the old truth that one man's God is another man's Devil.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps the interesting thing about <i class="calibre4">nandcatl</i> is its plural form. In Nahuatl nouns</p>

  <p class="calibre1">representing inanimate things are invariable as to number, and by this gram-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">matical convention the vegetable world is inanimate. But there are significant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">exceptions, of which the following three are outstanding:</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre5">SINGULAR PLURAL</b></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sky</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ilhuicatl</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ilhuicame</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mountain</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tepetl</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tetepe</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Star</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">dtldlin citlaltin</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">These exceptions are apparent rather than real, for the Nahua personified the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sky, mountains, and stars, and the plural form simply expresses the way of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">feeling that attributed to these cosmic beings a soul. There are other exceptions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">230</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">similarly suggestive. For example, <i class="calibre4">tetl,</i> 'stone', becomes <i class="calibre4">teme</i> in the plural,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but only when it refers to graven images. We believe that another exception</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is our <i class="calibre4">nandcatl,</i> a plural form expressive of the divine afflatus dwelling in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inebriating mushrooms.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How impressive is this grammatical evidence of the role of the mysterious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom in the Nahua mentality! It becomes all the more noteworthy when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we discover a perfect parallel among another mycophilic people, in this case the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Russians. At an early stage in the evolution of the Slavs there developed a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tendency to substitute the genitive case for the accusative when a masculine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">noun representing an animate creature was the goal of the verb. Today this is the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rule in the various Slavic languages. In folk Russian this genitive is used not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">only for nouns denoting animate beings, but also for the names of various</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms and sometimes for certain trees, when the mushroom or tree is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">individualized, i.e., is a single entity.2 This use is widespread in Russian dialects,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and occurs also in Ukrainian and White Russian. One hears <i class="calibre4">nashol griba,</i> 'he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">found the mushroom', <b class="calibre5">wither/fed</b> in the genitive case; <i class="calibre4">nashol grusdja, ryzhika,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">borovika.</i> Among the trees the oak is especially favored by similar treatment,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">e.g., <i class="calibre4">srubil duba,</i> 'he chopped down the oak'. The oak used to be worshipped</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in pagan times by the eastern Slavs as the thunder tree dedicated to the god</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perun. Thus in the folk language we discover a grammatical expression of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">animism. It is possible to offer yet another example in Russian. In the standard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">language the mushroom known as the <i class="calibre4">masljenik</i> has a special plural form,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">masljata,</i> and the plural of another mushroom name is <i class="calibre4">opjata</i> in certain unedu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cated circles. The plural suffix here used is normal only with certain nouns</p>

  <p class="calibre1">designating young animals, birds, and children! These peculiarities in Russian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grammar show that our interpretation of <i class="calibre4">nandcatl</i> does not strain credulity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Parallels in unrelated languages and cultures of this kind reinforce each other;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that is, they illuminate a common trait, in this case the inclination of peoples</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strongly mycophile to personify their beloved mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After our long parade of early authorities and learned analysis, let us sum</p>

  <p class="calibre1">up what we have discovered. When the Spaniards arrived in Mexico, they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">found an inebriating mushroom in wide use among the Indians from the Valley</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. It goes without saying that for our discussion of Nahuatl linguistics we have relied on several of the outstanding</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nahuatl specialists of our time, to wit, Professor Wigberto Jimenez Moreno of Mexico, Professor Charles E.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dibble of the University of Utah, and Dr. Arthur J. O. Anderson of the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We are the first to point out the significance of the plural form that we discover in <i class="calibre4">nandcatl,</i> a thesis to which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the aforementioned authorities give their reserved and tentative blessing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. For guidance on this feature of Russian grammar see A. A. Shakhmatov's <i class="calibre4">Kurs Istorii Russkogo Jazyka,</i> St.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Petersburg, 1911, vol. m, p. 338. We are also indebted to Prof. Roman Jakobson for his elaboration of the same</p>

  <p class="calibre1">theme in private correspondence.</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_18"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_9">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">of Mexico southwards. This mushroom produced hallucinations that the Indians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thought were divinely inspired. One author, Hernandez, says expressly that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there were various species of such mushrooms, and as he was a botanist his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">testimony is weighty. The lexicographer Molina mentions five species. There</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is a multiplicity of names for the inebriating mushrooms in Nahuatl, for which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">various explanations may be offered. Each species would have its own name, of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">course, and furthermore the names might vary according to the region. A</p>

  <p class="calibre1">third possibility is that the divine aura bathing the mushrooms might cause</p>

  <p class="calibre1">people to take refuge in euphemistic alternative names. The mushrooms of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">course were wild and seem to have grown both in meadows and in the woods.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(Jacinto de la Serna refers to them as <i class="calibre4">quautlannamacatl,</i> 'woodland mushrooms'.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As to one species, Sahagun says that they were small, with a stipe long for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">height, thin and round. Sahagun describes these as black, but others speak of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the inebriating mushrooms as golden or tawny or approaching red. In two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">authors we hear of ceremonies attending the gathering of mushrooms - nights of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">prayer and vigil. Four clearly associate the mushrooms with religious rites. Six</p>

  <p class="calibre1">agree that it was used in communal festivities that bordered on orgies and led</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to wild excesses. The mushrooms were eaten raw, and the taste was acrid or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bitter, honey being used as the vehicle for swallowing them. There is no reason</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to believe that our Spanish witnesses tasted the mushrooms, for (unless they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">came from Catalonia) they were mycophobes and this cultural heritage would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reinforce an initial repugnance for native 'idolatries'. But some of our witnesses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were Indians, albeit converted, and they must have known the taste and ac-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">curately described it. Sahagun alone speaks of a medicinal virtue in the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms: he says that the <i class="calibre4">teo-nandcatl</i> were good for gout and fevers. But on this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">point it is noteworthy that the mushrooms are not even mentioned in the great</p>

  <p class="calibre1">medicinal herbal of the Aztecs, known as the Badianus manuscript, which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was compiled in Sahagun's own convent, the Colegio de la Santa Cruz at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tlaltelulco, and doubtless under his supervision.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There may well be references to our sacred mushrooms in the old writers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that we have not come upon, and in the voluminous archives of unpublished</p>

  <p class="calibre1">documents in Mexico additional references will surely be discovered. At the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same time we must also stress the fact that by our method of culling and distil-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ling the references to the sacred mushrooms we inevitably convey an impression</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of their importance that is scarcely supported by the whole corpus of docu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. The authors were Indian converts, Martinez de la Cruz and Badianus the translator. The ms. lies in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vatican, but was published in facsimile by the Johns Hopkins Press in 1940, edited by Emily Walcott</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ments relating to i6th century Mexico. That documentation is immense. Other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">narcotic herbs also play a role therein: <i class="calibre4">poyomatl, ololiuqui, peiotl;</i> and tobacco</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">(pisiete]</i> was also treated as though it belonged in the same category. There are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">important i6th century sources dealing with such matters where references</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the inebriating mushrooms are strangely absent: one of these is that valuable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">work, <i class="calibre4">Problemas y Secretes Maravillosos de las Indias,</i> written by Juan de Cardenas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and published in Mexico in 1591.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From the beginning of our inquiries into the sacred mushroom of the Nahua</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we were on the lookout for i6th century illustrations of it. The botanist Her-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nandez in his text said that he was depicting four kinds of mushrooms including</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">teyhuinti,</b></i> but the 1790 edition carried no illustrations, and his drawings,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which would have been precious for us, must have been consumed in the Escorial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fire. However, our searches have not been bootless. In the Florentine Codex we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have discovered one picture, hitherto unremarked by students, and Robert J.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Weitlaner has drawn our attention to a second in the Magliabechiano Codex.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We take pleasure in reproducing both in faithful color, this being facilitated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by a happy chance: the two codices, though lying in different libraries, are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">both in Florence.2 The illustrations are singularly significant for us, being com-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">plementary, one of them executed by a Spanish artist and the other by an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indian in the tradition of his people, though he shows traces of Spanish influence.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Both illustrations are in the nature of pictographs, vignettes intended to convey</p>

  <p class="calibre1">almost a verbal message. Neither tells the mycologist anything mycological</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about the sacred mushrooms, but both are eloquent and curious expressions of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the contrasting attitudes of the two peoples toward them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sahagiin's great work survives in two principal codices, of which the Flo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rentine Codex, profusely illustrated, ranks first. Although most of the illustra-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tions were done by native artists, some were by Spaniards, and it was a Spaniard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who made the five small pictures representing various mushrooms that Sahagun</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. In 1952 Mr. Weitlaner discovered an old topographical codex or <i class="calibre4">lienzo</i> in the possession of the local authorities</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the village of Tlacoatzintepec, three days'journey by foot or animal from Chiltepec, in the State of Oaxaca,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where the people belong to the Chinantec culture area. A copy was made and is now preserved in the Museo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nacional. At one place in this chart, in a glade, there is a pair of crossed mushrooms. They might represent</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">teo-nandcatl,</i> but as the Indians are generally mycophagous, they might simply indicate a good spot for gathering</p>

  <p class="calibre1">edible fungi. That a <i class="calibre4">pair</i> of mushrooms is pictured may, however, be significant, as will become evident later</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in our argument.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. What we call the Florentine Codex lies in the Biblioteca Laurenziana, Florence, where it is designated Med.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pal. 218-220. The Magliabechiano Codex is in the Biblioteca Nazionale, Florence, and carries the designation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">B. R. 232. The miniatures of the former were badly reproduced in the Paso y Troncoso edition (uncompleted)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Sahagun, Madrid, 1905-6. The Magliabechiano Codex has been twice published in facsimile, the so-called</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Loubat edition, Rome, 1904; and by the University of California, Berkeley, 1903, under the guidance of Zelia</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clear that the artist worked from the text, and possessed no knowledge of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms outside the text. When he came to the inebriating mushroom,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he undertook to convey his iconographic message in a way natural to a i6th</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French to speak of the Devil as <i class="calibre4">k Bot,</i> the Cripple.1 In this French word and in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this picture we find blended the recurring themes of our book - Satan portrayed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as <i class="calibre4">le Bot,</i> a demonic mushroom, and offstage, by metaphoric transfer, the toad</p>

  <p class="calibre1">called <i class="calibre4">le hot</i> that constitutes the third of our unholy trinity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The second illustration offers us three elements - mushrooms, a man eating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, and behind and over him a ghost. The reader will notice that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. Malformed and bestial feet characterize various Aztec divinities. Thus the demon Tezcatlipoca was distin-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">guished by a club-foot, and Mictlanteculltli had the claws of a gigantic bird. But in the demon of the Flo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rentine miniature we think it is rash to perceive any influence of Mexican divinities. The craftsmanship reveals</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a European mind, and the imp is the obvious visual expression corresponding to the verbal denunciations that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the clergy, as we know, were heaping on the demonic mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the ghost is probably Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Underworld, who is depicted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on other pages of the same Codex. How far removed from the Spaniard's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">conception is the Indian's! Not only is the craftsmanship of these artists, con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">temporaries of each other, poles apart; their message is likewise. The Spaniard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reports rather prosaically the existence of a demonic mushroom to his European</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Magliabechiano Codex, Biblioteca Nazionale, Florence.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">public. The Indian, though undoubtedly a baptized Christian, conveys a sense</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the awe that he still felt in the presence of the mysterious <i class="calibre4">teo-nandcatl.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">That the mushrooms in this miniature are green should not disconcert the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycologist: green, the color of jade, meant in Mexican iconography that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">object so depicted was of great worth.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1 he last of our citations from old Spanish documents was from the mid-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seventeenth century: Jacinto de la Serna's episode with Chichiton. With him</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the references to the inebriating mushrooms ended. Thereafter observers no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">longer reported on the mushroom cult, and except in new editions of old</p>

  <p class="calibre1">books and in works based on them, the cult was never more mentioned. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cult itself was apparently extinct, and only a handful of specialists knew that it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had ever existed. For example, Francisco A. Flores, when in 1886-8 he brought</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out in Mexico his three volume <i class="calibre4">Historia de la Medidna en Mexico,</i> listed the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nahuatl names for the inebriating mushrooms as given by Molina, translated</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_22"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_11">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">them, and then rashly by sheer guesswork tried to identify them according to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">classifications of mycologists. William H. Prescott in his classic <i class="calibre4">Conquest of</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Mexico</i> ignored the subject. Yet we know that he was familiar with it. He drew</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on most of the sources that we have cited, and in particular the two accounts</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Montezuma's assumption of office. In Book II Chapter 6 he speaks of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'honorable entertainment' offered to the Tlascalan princes by Montezuma, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he deftly excises the reference to the sacred mushrooms. By now one is so used</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the subconscious rejection of mushrooms by the mycophobic Anglo-Saxons</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that it would be more a matter of remark if Prescott had mentioned the <i class="calibre4">teo-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">nandcatl.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then suddenly one day the sacred mushrooms sprang to life again. On</p>

  <p class="calibre1">May 4, 1915, an ethno-botanist of established and deserved reputation, W. E.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Safford, read a paper before the Botanical Society in Washington in which he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">flatly and sweepingly denied that there had ever been an inebriating mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the indigenous cultures of Mexico. His paper was published later in that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">year in the <i class="calibre4">journal of Heredity,</i> and it was a full-dress presentation, richly il-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lustrated and documented. Dr. Safford said that the Spanish 'padres' (as he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">somewhat condescendingly called them) had been confused: they had taken</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for mushrooms what had really been dried buttons of a cactus, the Lophophora</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Williamsii, the <i class="calibre4">peyotl</i> of Aztec times, the mescal button of Texas. He declared</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that three centuries had failed to reveal a fungal intoxicant in Mexico. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quoted Sahagun as saying that the Chichimecas had been the first Indians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to discover the alleged intoxicating property of the 'mushroom'; he went on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to say that the Chichimecas had occupied northern Mexico, that that was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">therefore the region where to seek the mushroom, that he had pushed his own</p>

  <p class="calibre1">researches exhaustively in those areas and in the Southwestern states of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">United States, and that he had found nothing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Safford's paper drew wide attention and was widely accepted. Many</p>

  <p class="calibre1">learned from it for the first time that there had been a belief in an inebriating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom, at the same time that they learned the mushroom had never existed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How ironic it will be if Dr. Safford himself, in the long run, should be remem-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bered chiefly because of this resounding blunder that he made, a classic example</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the fallibility of the specialist! For of course the Spanish 'padres' were right</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Dr. Safford was wrong. Dr. Safford's paper was extraordinary for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vehemence (may we say 'telltale' vehemence?) that this Anglo-Saxon showed in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rejecting the <i class="calibre4">teo-nandcatl.</i> It never occurred to him that he had to demolish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not only the Spanish 'padres' but also all the native informants on whom they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">relied, and even the Nahuatl vocabulary that they used!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">236</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The source of Dr. Safford's error lay in his misreading of Sahagun's sentence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about the Chichimecas and the emphasis that he placed on this single miscon-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strued passage. Loosely constructed though the sentence is after the fashion of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">16th century prose, its meaning is clear. The Chichimecas were the first to use</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">thepeyotl,</i> says Sahagun, and they used it in the way that we the Nahua (Sahagun's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">informants) use the inebriating mushroom. We may be sure that Dr. Safford</p>

  <p class="calibre1">canvassed the Chichimeca country thoroughly, and his negative findings there</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in the Southwest of the United States tend to confirm our interpretation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Sahagun.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Just as toxins appropriately administered stimulate the growth of anti-bodies,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so the Safford paper served a useful purpose in stimulating the inquiries of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mexican workers, who properly resented the charge that early Spanish observers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">could not tell a mushroom from a cactus button. The details of this inquiry</p>

  <p class="calibre1">need not detain us here. To Dr. Bias Pablo Reko, a Mexican of Austrian birth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Slavic provenience, belongs the primary accolade for persisting in the search</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the mushroom cult. He was the first to declare his belief that the cult still</p>

  <p class="calibre1">survived. He so expressed himself shortly after the Safford lecture, and he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">began to look for the cult in the State of Oaxaca. To Robert J. Weitlaner goes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the distinction of having first re-discovered the sacred mushrooms themselves.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This excellent anthropologist and tireless worker laid his hands on samples in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the remote town of Huautla de Jimenez, Oaxaca, in 1936. He sent them to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Reko who in turn forwarded them to the botanical authorities at Harvard.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They arrived in bad condition but could be identified as a species of panaeolus.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Huautla is the chief town of the Indians known as Mazatecs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In that same year Dr. Reko's cousin, Victor A. Reko, had published in Stutt-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gart the first paper challenging the Safford argument, <i class="calibre4">Magische Gifte: Rausch-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">und Betaubungsmittel der Neuen Welt.</i> In 1938 a young Harvard ethno-botanist,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Richard Evans Schultes, visited Huautla and obtained additional samples</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the mushrooms and photographs of them in a fresh state. With the help of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. David Linder of the Farlow Herbarium, Harvard University, he identified</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them as panseolus campanulatus L. var. sphinctrinus (Fr.) Bresadola. His speci-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mens, carefully preserved, were again examined in the fall of 1955 by Roger</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Heim, who confirmed without hesitation the previous identification. In that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same year 1938, on the night of Saturday-Sunday, July 16-17, four white persons</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Huautla attended a mushroom rite performed expressly for them. The four</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were the promising young anthropologist Jean Bassett Johnson, his wife Irmgard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Weitlaner-Johnson, Bernard Bevan, and Louise Lacaud. In a paper published</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the following year Mr. Johnson gave to the world the first account of the ancient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">237</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_24"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_12">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">rite: there is no evidence that any white persons had ever before attended it.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He did not identify the mushrooms that were used.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">\</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In European sources there is some evidence of inebriating mushrooms in ad-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dition to the fly amanita. Indeed, the earliest recorded reference to psychic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">symptoms caused by mushrooms clearly did not relate to the amanita muscaria.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Before describing the fly amanita Albertus Magnus in <i class="calibre4">De Vegetalibus</i> remarks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the propensity of certain mushrooms to bring about mental disturbance:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Signum autem, quod habcnt humidum vaporosum, est, quod comesti frequenter op-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pilant vias spirituum animalium in capite, et inducunt insaniam.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[Op. cit., Book 2, Chap. 6:87]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Moreover, an indication that they [fungi] are of a moist humor is that when eaten</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they often stop up in the head the mental passages of the creatures [that eat them], and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bring on insanity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. The Johnson paper is important. Entitled 'The Elements of Mazatec Witchcraft', it was published by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Gothenburg Ethnographical Museum in Sweden in 1939 as Ethnological Studies 9. Dr. Schultes published two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">papers, one as a Botanical Museum Leaflet, Harvard University, Feb. 21, 1939, vol. 7, no. 3, <i class="calibre4">The Identification of</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Teonanacatl;</i> the other, 'Teonanacatl: the Narcotic Mushroom of the Aztecs', in the <i class="calibre4">American Anthropologist,</i> n.s.,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">42, 1940. These three and Dr. Reko's <i class="calibre4">Mitobotdnica Zapoteca,</i> published by himself in 1945, constitute our basic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">modern bibliography. Victor A. Reko's <i class="calibre4">Magische Gifte,</i> of which a third edition appeared in Stuttgart in 194.9,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must be read with caution. For example, he guesses at the identity of the inebriating mushroom, postulating an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'amanita muscaria var. mex.' More disturbing is his assertion that <i class="calibre4">poyomatli,</i> a narcotic plant, was a mushroom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He arrives at this conclusion by misquoting a passage in Sahagun (substituting <i class="calibre4">llamados</i> for <i class="calibre4">llamada),</i> and by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ignoring another passage in Sahagun where the <i class="calibre4">poyomatli</i> is described in detail as a plant. (See <i class="calibre4">Magische Gifte,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1949, p. 126; Sahagun, Book X, Chap. 24, <i class="calibre4">Canute de Humo;</i> also Book xi, Chap. 7, Sec. 7.) Since Victor Reko</p>

  <p class="calibre1">published his work in German, German writers frequently cite him and are misled by him. The modern discus-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sions of our subject are also bedeviled by two idle conjectures of the late Marshall H. Saville, the archeologist,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who without a shred of supporting evidence suggested (i) that the Aztec ruler Tizoc had been murdered with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">poisonous mushrooms, and (2) that the astonishing dental work found in the teeth of Zapotec skeletons had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been performed with the aid of mushrooms as narcotics. For the Tizoc reference, see J. Eric Thompson's <i class="calibre4">Mexico</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">before Cortez,</i> Scribner's, New York, 1933, p. 31. As for the Zapotec dental work, Saville tossed out his fanciful</p>

  <p class="calibre1">notion in an extempore, unrecorded talk before the Explorers' Club, New York <i class="calibre4">(Explorers Journal,</i> 1934, vol.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">12, p. 7) and a subsequent interview <i class="calibre4">(The New York Times,</i> April n, 1934). The Swedish archeologist S. Linne</p>

  <p class="calibre1">took Saville's dental suggestion seriously; see <i class="calibre4">Ethnos,</i> Stockholm, Jan. -June 1940, p. 7. Schultes in his two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">papers quotes Saville (via Thompson) on Tizoc. Safford's mushroomic nihilism may have led, by reaction,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to Saville's postulating mushroomic agents right and left in pre-Conquest Middle America. As Saville never</p>

  <p class="calibre1">offered his mushroomic ideas formally, we infer that he regarded them as speculative. Bias Pablo Reko in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Mitobotdnica Zapoteca</i> (pp. 13, 14, 44, 53, and 95) reported names for inebriating mushrooms in contemporary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Zapotec, but he failed to place his informants. In a typewritten note of his left with Mr. Weitlaner he states</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that in 193 5 he found the divinatory mushrooms in use among the Zapotecs of Santiago Yaveo and the Chiiian-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tecs of Teocalcingo, two villages situated hard by the Mije country. He gives Chinantec names for these mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms <i class="calibre4">(a-ni</i> and <i class="calibre4">a-mo-kia).</i> The Chinantecs generally do not know the mushrooms, and if Dr. Reko's report</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is reliable, we suspect a cultural borrowing from the neighboring Mijes. Our own efforts to discover knowledge</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the divinatory mushrooms among the Zapotecs of Tehuantepec and the Valley of Oaxaca have been un-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">successful. Pedro Carrasco reports the present day use of the divinatory mushroom in Zapotec country, among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Zapotecs of the southern coast, in the western part of the district of Pochutla, in the village of San Bartolo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Loxicha, where he says it is called the <i class="calibre4">santo nanacate.</i> See his 'Una Cuenta Ritual entre los Zapotecos del Sur' in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Festschrift entitled <i class="calibre4">Homenaje al Doctor Alfonso Caso,</i> Mexico, 1951, p. 93. On the strength of his evidence we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">visited the southern Zapotec country in 1955, with successful results. See pp. 307 ff.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The great Clusius may have described, an inebriating mushroom. In the section</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the <i class="calibre4">Fungi pernidaks</i> of Hungary he arrives at the eleventh of the evil species</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and says this concerning it:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ungaricum nomen nullum intellexi, sed Germanicum est <i class="calibre4">Narrenschlvammen</i> ac si dice-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">res fatuum vel fatuorum fungum, quoniam forte, si quis vescatur, mente turbetur . . .</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Corpore dum e sua volva erumpit, est boleto dissimili, longiore pediculo subnixum</p>

  <p class="calibre1">minimo digito graciliore, sescuncialis latitudinis, in metam assurgens, superna parte</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Candida, inferna camerata, &amp; multis striis, a pediculo in ambitum productis, notata.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I did not learn its Hungarian name, but in German it is <i class="calibre4">Narrenschwamm,</i> i.e., 'foolish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungus' or 'fungus of fools', since one may see that he who eats becomes mentally upset...</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Its body, when once it has broken its volva, is unlike the Boletus, with a stipe thinner</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than the little finger, [the cap] less than 4 cm. in diameter, heading up into a conical top,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">white above, partitioned below with multiple furrows, radiating from the stem in a circle.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our Hungarian friend, Dr. Stephan F. Borhegyi, has supplied us with the Ma-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gyar name that Clusius failed to get: <i class="calibre4">bolondgomba,</i> 'fool-mushroom', a term still</p>

  <p class="calibre1">familiarly used in Hungary, especially in the rural areas, as when one asks of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">person behaving foolishly, "Have you eaten the fool's mushroom;", or when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one rejects a proposition by saying, "Do you think I have eaten a fool-mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room, that I should do such a thing?" Or again: "He is laughing as though he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had eaten fool's mushrooms." In Hungary the 'wise-woman', <i class="calibre4">javas asszony,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">is said to use this same mushroom in love philtres, and the angry lover sends the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">philtre on to the object of his passion. We think this is the same mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that, as we saw on page 78, the Slovakian peasant calls <i class="calibre4">salene huby.</i> The Slovakian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word finds a surprising echo in the iyth century verses of the Polish poet Waclaw</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Potocki, which we mentioned on page 15. He is advising his readers about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, and warns them against a kind called <i class="calibre4">szmer,</i> lest it render the reader</p>

  <p class="calibre1">foolish <i class="calibre4">(szalec)</i> 'as from opium'! In Vienna one may hear the saying, <i class="calibre4">Er hat</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">verruckte Schwammerln gegessen,</i> 'He has eaten the mad mushrooms.' Whether</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this is native to the Austrian countryside, or a loan made in imperial times from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hungary or the Carpathians, we do not know.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thanks to Clusius and the Continental usage, John Parkinson in his <i class="calibre4">Theatricum</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Botanicum</i> (1640) speaks of the 'foolish mushroom', describing it rather well:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">... about half an inch broad, spiring a little at the toppe, and being of a whitish colour,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with a long stalke, of the thicknesse of ones little finger: this is called the foolish or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fooles Mushrome. [P. 1321]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">What was and is this fool's mushroom that Albertus Magnus mentioned and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Clusius described and the peasants of central Europe invoke in their old saws ?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">239</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_26"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_13">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Our only good clue lies in the paintings that Clusius made, now preserved in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Leiden: for Clusius the <i class="calibre4">Narrenschwamm</i> was, beyond a doubt, the amanita va-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ginata. Is it possible that this edible mushroom, if eaten raw, causes psychic dis-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">turbance? Clusius' identification is uncorroborated. Is it possible that he made</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a mistake, that his informants in Hungary were not heirs to the true tradition,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that they were not privy to the secret ? Perhaps the folklorists of Central Europe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">can yet run to earth the haunting reference incapsulated in the <i class="calibre4">Narrenschwamm,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">with its echoes of far-off fungal knowledge.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We might have expected the 'fool's mushroom' to be a species of panaeolus,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for there is medical evidence to support the intoxicating virtue of this genus of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms. A surgeon named G. Glen, Esq., reported on a case in the <i class="calibre4">London</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Medical and Physical Journal,</i> 1816, on pages 451-3. It seems that on October 16 of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that year a poor man living in Knightsbridge gathered a mess of mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">around a copse behind the Horse Guards barracks in Hyde Park. He thought they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were field mushrooms, and after stewing them, proceeded to eat them. About</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eight or ten minutes later, when only six or eight mushrooms were left on his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">plate, he was seized with giddiness, dimness of vision, and a general loss of power.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With utmost difficulty and only by the help of a friend whom he met, he made</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his way to Mr. Glen's consulting room five hundred yards away. He was reeling</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like a drunken man. It is noteworthy that Mr. Glen says his patient spoke</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with hesitation and reluctantly, and was greatly inclined to sleep. There was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">no nausea. By the next day the patient was well on the road to recovery, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mr. Glen was inclined to the view, natural to medical men under the circum-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stances, that his own ministrations had either saved the poor man's life or spared</p>

  <p class="calibre1">him a prolonged illness. Mr. Glen examined the mushrooms left from the stew</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and also gathered fresh ones from the place where the first had been found.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He identified them as panseolus campanulatus Linn., and this was confirmed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by a Mr. William Salisbury of Sloane Street, a person deemed competent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the matter. Mr. Glen drew attention to the fact that two parallel cases had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been summarily reported in the August 1815 issue of the <i class="calibre4">Gentleman's Magazine,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same species being held accountable in those instances also.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Exactly one century after Mr. Glen's experience, in the summer of 1916,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">an American surgeon, Dr. Beaman Douglass, gathered a mess of mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that he believed were of the genus panasolus, though the species remains un-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">certain. He, his wife, and the maid ate them, spreading the cooked mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on toast. One hour later Mrs. Douglass developed psychic symptoms, and his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">followed shortly afterwards. Both lost their sense of balance and mental control.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was pronounced stimulation. Mrs. Douglass manifested "a tendency</p>

  <p class="calibre1">240</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to be jolly, hilarious - she laughed and talked inordinately and foolishly." As</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for Dr. Douglass, this is what he recalled, "I wished to be noisy, to laugh and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">joke. My own trivial remarks met with my own warm personal appreciation . . .</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thoughts flew through my brain. . . Objects near seemed far away, sounds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were diminished. . . ." The maid underwent a similar experience. Six hours</p>

  <p class="calibre1">after eating and five hours after the first symptoms all evidence of intoxication</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had disappeared. At no time had there been nausea.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mushrooms of the genus panasolus are found everywhere in the temperate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and tropical zones, and there are many species. Henri Fabre knew them, of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">course, and we offer to our readers a reproduction of his painting of the panaeolus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">campanulatus. To us it seems outstanding in artistic composition, in the delicacy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the curves, the lilt of the caps. This mushroom is not normally eaten in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">France, but so far as we can learn it is not regarded as inebriating even by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophilic country folk of the Provence. There is no reason to think that Fabre</p>

  <p class="calibre1">considered it uncanny. Yet is there not something eerie about the cobra-curves</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the little mushrooms in his painting, as though he sensed a secret &gt;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is a reproach to mycologists in these unexplored hints and evidence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of psychic effects caused by mushrooms, hints deeply rooted in Europe's folk-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ways, evidence clearly reported over centuries from Kamchatka, New Guinea,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Middle America. It seems strange that archaic peoples should still possess</p>

  <p class="calibre1">secrets of this kind that our laboratories have not exhaustively analyzed. Indeed,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Swiss and English workers may lately have arrived, at last, on this exciting ter-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rain for scientific inquiry. From the fungus known as ergot Swiss pharmaco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logists have recently isolated an alkaloid that causes massive psychic reactions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in human beings, including hallucinations that duplicate with astonishing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fidelity the testimony of our old Spanish writers. Experiments with this alkaloid</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in England and America seem to open up promising vistas for its use in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">treatment of psycho-neurotic disorders.2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1 hat Dr. Reko and Dr. Schultes brought back a panasolus from their quests</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the divinatory mushrooms was not the full answer to our problem. Were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there not other divinatory species, belonging to different genera? Both Dr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Reko and Dr. Schultes thought so, and the former even obtained specimens of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">two other genera. Further questions suggested themselves, and we resolved to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pursue our inquiry on our own account.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In response to an inquiry of ours, Dr. Reko wrote us on February 12, 1953,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that he had nothing further to add to the information he had published, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggested that we address ourselves to a Miss Eunice Victoria Pike, an American</p>

  <p class="calibre1">linguistic student and Bible translator who had been living for many months</p>

  <p class="calibre1">each year since 1936 among the Mazatec Indians, with her headquarters in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Huautla. She spoke Mazatec, he added, and thus she had access to the thoughts</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and feelings of the monolingual elements in the population. Immediately after</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thus introducing us to Miss Pike, Dr. Reko died. We wrote to her, and she has</p>

  <p class="calibre1">proved a most helpful and understanding correspondent. Even Miss Pike after</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all these years has never attended a performance of the divinatory rite, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speaking the language and living among the people, she reports the words of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">those who know and understand, and their words are more valuable than</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would be the uncomprehending testimony of an outsider witnessing the event.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">experience of a people far removed culturally from one's own; We reproduce</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in full Miss Pike's letter to us, as a primary source on a theme of absorbing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here is Miss Pike's letter:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Huautla de Jimenez • Oaxaca, Mexico</p>

  <p class="calibre1">March 9, 1953</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dear Mr. Wasson:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I'm glad to tell you whatever I can about the Mazatec mushroom. Some day I may</p>

  <p class="calibre1">write up my observations for publication, but in the meantime you may make what use</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of it you can.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mazatecs seldom talk about the mushroom to outsiders, but belief in it is widespread.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A twenty-year old boy told me," I know that outsiders don't use the mushroom, but Jesus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gave it to us because we are poor people and can't afford a doctor and expensive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">medicine."1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sometimes they refer to it as 'the blood of Christ' because supposedly it grows only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where a drop of Christ's blood has fallen. They say that the land in this region is 'living'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">because it will produce the mushroom, whereas the hot dry country where the mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">will not grow is called 'dead'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. Miss Pike informed us later that this and other translations were from the Mazatec, not from Spanish.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">T H E S A C R E D M U S H R O O M S O F T H E N A H U A</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They say that it helps 'good people' but if someone who is bad eats it, 'it kills him or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">makes him crazy.' When they speak of 'badness' they mean 'ceremonially unclean'. (A</p>

  <p class="calibre1">murderer if he is ceremonially clean can eat the mushroom with no ill effects.) A person</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is considered safe if he refrains from intercourse five days before and after eating the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom. A shoemaker in our part of town went crazy about five years ago. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">neighbours say it was because he ate the mushroom and then had intercourse with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his wife.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">• When a family decides to make use of the mushroom they tell their friends to bring</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them any they see, but they ask only those whom they can trust to refrain from intercourse</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at that time, for if the person who gathers the mushroom has had intercourse, it will</p>

  <p class="calibre1">make the person who eats it crazy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Usually it is not the sick person nor his family who eat the mushroom. They pay a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'wiseman' to eat it and to tell them what the mushroom says. (He does so with a loud</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rhythmic chant.) The wiseman always eats the mushroom at night, because it 'prefers to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">work unseen'. Usually he eats it about nine o'clock and it starts talking about a half an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hour or an hour later. The Mazatecs speak of the mushroom as though it had a personality.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They never say, "The wiseman said the mushroom said..." They always quote the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room direct.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The wiseman always eats the mushroom raw; "If anyone cooks or burns the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room it will give them bad sores." There is no specified number of how many he should</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eat, some wisemen eat more than others, usually they eat four or five. If he eats a lot, it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'wants to kill him'. At such a time the wiseman falls down unconscious, and comes to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">little by little as the other people in the room 'pray for him'. This may also happen 'if</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he has had intercourse too recently'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When all goes well, the wiseman sees visions and the mushroom talks about two or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">three hours. "It is Jesus Christ himself who talks to us!" The mushroom tells them what</p>

  <p class="calibre1">made the person sick. He may say the person was bewitched; if so, he tells who did it,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">why, and how. He may say the person has 'fear sickness'. He may say it is a sickness</p>

  <p class="calibre1">curable by medicine and suggest that the person call a doctor.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">More important, he will tell whether or not the person is going to live or die. If he says</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he will live, then "he gets better even though he has been very sick". If he says he will die,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then the family start making arrangements for the funeral and he tells who should inherit</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his property. (One of my informants admitted, however, that the mushroom occasionally</p>

  <p class="calibre1">makes mistakes.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One of the "proofs" that it is "Jesus Christ himself" who talks to them is that anyone</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who eats the mushroom sees visions. Everyone we have asked suggests that they are seeing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into heaven itself. They don't insist on that point, and as an alternative they suggest that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they are seeing moving pictures of the U.S.A. Most of them agree that the wisemen</p>

  <p class="calibre1">frequently see the ocean and for these mountain people that is exciting.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I have asked what the wiseman looks like while under influence of the mushroom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They say that he is not sleeping, he is sitting up, with his eyes open, "awake". They</p>

  <p class="calibre1">say he does not drink liquor at the time, but that he may in the morning. Some of them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">go right out to work the next day, but some stay home and sleep "because they have been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">awake all night".</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_15">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Although we have never been present when the mushroom was eaten, we have ob-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">served the influence it has on the people. One of our neighbors had tuberculosis and was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coming to us for medical help. Then one night they called in the wiseman to eat the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room in his behalf. It told them that he would die.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The next day the patient no longer had any interest in our medicines; instead he began</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to set affairs in order for death. He quit eating solid food, restricting himself to corn gruel.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">About two weeks later he refused even gruel, accepting only an occasional sip of water.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A few days later even water was rejected. In less than a month after he had consulted the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom he was dead.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Another neighboring family had a series of sicknesses. They consulted the mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for their twenty-two year old son. The mushroom said he would get better, and he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">did. When their eighteen-year old daughter became ill, they consulted the mushroom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It said she would get better and she did.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then the ten year old daughter became ill. The mushroom said that this one would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">die. The family were amazed because her illness had not seemed serious. Of course they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were grief stricken, but the mushroom said, "Don't be concerned, I'll take her soul</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to be with me." So, following her mother's instructions the little girl prayed to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thing talking to her, "If you don't want to cure me, take my soul." A day or two later</p>

  <p class="calibre1">she was dead.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">- Not all the Mazatecs believe that the mushroom's messages are from Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those who speak Spanish and have had contact with the outside world are apt to declare,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"It's just a lot of lies'."Most monolinguals, however, will either declare that it is Jesus Christ</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who speaks to them, or they will ask a little doubting, "What do you say, is it true that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it is the blood of Jesus?"</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I regret the survival of the use of the mushroom, for we know of no case in which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it has had beneficial results. I wish they'd consult the Bible when they seek out Christ's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wishes, and not be deceived by a 'wiseman' and the mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In answer to your questions:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The mushroom (called <i class="calibre4">si3tho3,</i> or affectionately <i class="calibre4">'nti1 si3tho3)</i> is brown in color and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grows biggest in June and July when the rainfall is heaviest. At that time they may be four</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inches across and about four inches tall. They are still plentiful in September and October.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By March and April, the dry season, the mushroom is scarce, but small ones may still be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">found.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The mushroom grows in the grass, but when people are hunting for it, they look first</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the places where cattle have been, because the mushroom is most frequently found</p>

  <p class="calibre1">growing out of cow manure.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They do not dry the mushroom. If they cannot find one growing, they go without.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The person I asked doubted that it was possible to dry them. At first she thought they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would not. Then she said that maybe they could be dried, but she doubted that they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would serve as medicine that way.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I do not know that the Mazatecs ever use the mushroom in connection with a fiesta.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the most part it is used in connection with sickness. I have heard of one other minor use</p>

  <p class="calibre1">however. They say a man may slip a piece into an enemy's liquor while he is drinking in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a saloon. If he drinks it while ceremonially unclean, he may go crazy. Or he might go</p>

  <p class="calibre1">crazy because the man who gathered it was ceremonially unclean. Wishing you success</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sincerely,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">(Signed)</i> Eunice V. Pike</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Miss Pike's letter settled one question for us. For some time we had been con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sidering a visit to Huautla. Now we were resolved to make it. Much of her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">information was of that precious kind which can only be obtained when one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speaks with the Indians in their own language on terms of long standing friend-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ship and complete mutual confidence. We could not hope to improve on her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">contribution. But there were many unanswered questions. For one thing, her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms reached four inches in diameter; they could not belong to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">genus panasolus. What then were they?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Mazatec country there are two seasons of the year when mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should be abundant, at the beginning and at the end of the rains, in June and in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the first half of August. We decided on August for our trip. Miss Pike would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be absent then, but her colleague in Mexico City, Mrs. George Cowan, pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ficient in Mazatec and intimate with Huautla, would know how to help us get</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there. We also were successful in exciting the interest of Mr. Weitlaner, who</p>

  <p class="calibre1">agreed to accompany us. This was our greatest stroke of fortune, for with his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">knowledge of the country and the Indians, at least some measure of success was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">assured. Our objectives were simple: to obtain specimens of the sacred mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms, for purposes of identification and trial consumption by ourselves, to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">learn about the present state of the cult, and to attend the mushroom rite.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We set out from Mexico City on Saturday morning, August 8, 1953. Apart</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the chauffeur we were four - Robert Weitlaner, whom we shall call</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hereafter Don Roberto, VPW, RGW, and our sixteen year old daughter Masha.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On that day we drove through Puebla to Tehuacan, a watering resort, where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we dismissed the car and spent the night. On Sunday we took the train to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">San Antonio, about two hours away, and from the mournful railroad station</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reeking in the torrid heat of a semi-arid countryside we drove a mile or so in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ramshackle bus, loaded with Spanish-speaking Indians and their worldly goods,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">over the worst road in the world to Teotitlan del Camino, a bustling market</p>

  <p class="calibre1">town and the stepping off place for the Mazatec country. We spent Sunday</p>

  <p class="calibre1">night there, in the inn kept by Julia Martinez, a woman unforgettably obese.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Early the next morning Victor Hernandez was at the door with six animals,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">five mules and a horse, all of them miserably small and thin. He was a Mazatec</p>

  <p class="calibre1">245</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_32"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_16">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">from Huautla who spoke a fair amount of Spanish. He had come for us in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">response to a telegram that Mrs. Cowan had sent to a friend in Huautla, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">school teacher Herlinda Martinez Cid. Our belongings in duffle bags and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">knapsacks were soon loaded, and off we started up the steep trail into the moun-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tains east of Teotitlan. After two hours of climbing we reached San Bernardino,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a village superbly perched on a mountain spur looking back over the hot low</p>

  <p class="calibre1">country that we had left behind. There we breakfasted on tortillas and beans</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and then off we went again, on a long steady climb until we arrived at the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">first of the passes, known as La Cumbre, perhaps 9,000 feet high. Here we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thought to stop for a bite to eat from our provisions, but Victor would not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hear of it. He said the Cumbre was a favorite spot for robbers, who would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beset the wayfarers on animals spent from the long climb and then vanish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in any of various directions down the slopes. We noticed for the first time that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Victor was armed with a revolver at his waist. Later we learned that four</p>

  <p class="calibre1">robbers, many years before, had been hanged on the Curnbre, and their bodies</p>

  <p class="calibre1">left swinging for months in that desolate wind-swept place. And so we hurried</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on down into the next valley, and up again to a second pass, and down again,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and finally up the last steep climb into the town of Huautla, itself perched on a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mountain side at an altitude ranging from 5,500 to 6,000 feet. We had been on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the road for eleven hours through country of wild grandeur, the mountains</p>

  <p class="calibre1">covered with vegetation, with only two or three thatched villages discerned in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the distance. But on the trail itself there had been considerable traffic, as strings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of animals kept passing us, laden with sacks of coffee and other produce bound</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the market in Teotitlan. Like our Victor, the drivers were all on foot,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">barefoot or wearing sandals, hurrying along at a dogtrot. Their animals gave us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">some trouble in the narrow way, as the beasts, stepping along, would brush</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us with their heavy sacks and push us uncomfortably toward the precipitous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">outer edge of the path. Victor observed our difficulty, and soon it dawned on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us that on-coming drivers were halting their animals and letting us pass. Victor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had been notifying them of our approach and bespoken their consideration.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He had not uttered a word, or so we thought. But we had read, in preparation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for our trip, about the Mazatecs, and knew that the language could be whistled</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as well as spoken. Yes, in a well-modulated, penetrating whistle Victor had been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">conversing about us with the on-coming muleteers, even before they would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">come around a bend into view, and at his request they were letting us pass!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At the end of the day, as night was falling, we walked our animals slowly up</p>

  <p class="calibre1">through the town of Huautla, across the public plaza, up the hill to the house</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where Herlinda was waiting for us, standing in her door and smiling at us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We were tired out, and the warm reception that this Indian school-teacher</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cheered us with was most welcome. That night we all slept on the packed-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">earth floor of one of her three rooms. Herlinda's aged mother lay moaning,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">critically ill, in the front room. On the following day we rented a new, un-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">occupied house nearby, paying five pesos (or fifty-five <b class="calibre5">U.S.</b> cents) for a week's</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">use. There we also slept on the ground, and we had our meals with Herlinda,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who stayed home from school to take care of us. From Victor and others during</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our stay we heard stories of the lawlessness of these Mazatec Indians, and it is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">true that no one goes abroad after nightfall, whether on the trails from one town</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to another or within the town itself; and armed with their machetes the Indians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">&gt;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">247</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_34"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_17">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">looked to us fearsome enough, when we would meet them on the road. But</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fact is that they treated us always with perfect courtesy and gentleness,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and those few whose aid we sought in confidence in our mushroomic inquiries</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were most understanding in their efforts to help us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Mazatec Indians number about 60,000, all of them concentrated in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mountains of north central Oaxaca. They live chiefly in villages, though some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dwell on their farms. There is a distinctive Mazatec style of house - by tradition</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a rectangular roof of thatch supported on posts, with walls made of thin boards</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or adobe filling in the space between the posts. The gable roofs are invariably</p>

  <p class="calibre1">constructed with a thatch overhang at each end of the ridge pole, the overhang</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strikingly suggestive of the ear of an English sheepdog. The Mazatecs are short</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and stocky; many of the women still wear the embroidered <i class="calibre4">huipil</i> ('blouse')</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that is the ancestral dress of the Indians of Mexico and Guatemala. Of animals</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they breed only goats, and they live primarily by farming, with maize and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beans their staple foods, supplemented by sweet potatoes and all the fruits</p>

  <p class="calibre1">common in the tropics and sub-tropics, along with chickens and turkeys.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Coffee is their cash crop, and the coffee of Huautla is one of the finest in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world. Their language is wholly unrelated to Nahuatl or Zapotec. It is one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a family of four languages, Mazatec, Chocho, Ixcatec and Popoloca, all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">having branched off supposedly from an ancestral stock in the order in which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we have listed them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of these four languages, Ixcatec is spoken in only one town, Santa Maria de</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ixcatlan. Popoloca must be distinguished from another language, called some-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times Popoluca and sometimes Popoloca de Vera Cruz, which belongs to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mije-Zoque group. In classic Nahuatl the word <i class="calibre4">popoloca</i> was a contemptuous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">epithet for any tongue considered barbarian by the Nahua, and this is how the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">term came to be permanently applied to two unrelated Indian languages.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Mazatec' is not a designation for himself that the Mazatec uses. It is the outsider's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">term, derived from the Mazatec town of Mazatlan. The Mazatec is apt to call</p>

  <p class="calibre1">himself by the name of the town where he is born and lives.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The distinctive feature of Mazatec, and indeed of many other languages of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Oaxaca cultural mosaic, is the tonal system. In Mazatec the pitch at which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">successive syllables are uttered is of primary semantic importance. This is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what makes communication by whistling or humming simple. The Chinese is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tonal language too, but the 'contour' tones of Chinese are basically different</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the 'registered' tones of constant pitch in the language of the Mazatecs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the Mazatec muleteer initiates a whistled conversation with a friend</p>

  <p class="calibre1">some distance away, the key that he adopts sets the key for his friend's answer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">248</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the whole conversation follows in that key. Anything that can be said in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the language can be said whistling. Mrs. Johnson had sent by us some trinkets -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">earrings, a ring, a bracelet - to an Indian godchild of hers, living outside the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">village of San Andres, a few miles from Huautla. With Victor we walked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thither along the ancient mountain path. He found the Indian cottage, high</p>

  <p class="calibre1">above the path. He tilted his head far back, and in a pleasant whistled discourse</p>

  <p class="calibre1">explained the circumstances - certainly unusual ones for this isolated Indian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">family. Soon there were signs of activity above, and down a precipitous footpath</p>

  <p class="calibre1">came three women - the grandmother, the mother, and the child herself, now</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sixteen. The grandmother and mother were bearing simple homespun textiles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">across their forearms, a gift to send back to Mrs. Johnson in exchange for her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">remembrance. None of the women knew a word of Spanish, and after a brief</p>

  <p class="calibre1">conversation through Victor as our interpreter, we withdrew, the women raising</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their hands, palms turned to us at shoulder level, and bowing us a friendly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and moving farewell. By Victor's whistling they had learned exactly who had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">come to call and why, and they came down to greet us on the path equipped</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with reciprocal gifts, not to be outdone by our courtesy. There is a curious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">convention in Mazatec whistling: though women understand it and know how</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to do it, a rule of behavior makes it improper for a woman to whistle in public.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Huautla is a town with several thousand inhabitants. It could not be more</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beautifully situated, on a mountain side in a theater of verdant mountains,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bathed in flowers and sub-tropical vegetation, free of mosquitoes by reason</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the altitude. It is a bustling market town, full of movement and life. Yet</p>

  <p class="calibre1">most of the population speaks only a tongue that, until now, has never been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">written, and those few who know Spanish often know only a smattering of it. v</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Most Mazatecs never sleep in a bed, rolling themselves in their sarapes on a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mat on the beaten earth in their houses. Most of them have never worn shoes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Victor could not read time by a clock-face. Except in Huautla where there are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wheelbarrows, there is no wheeled vehicle in the Mazatec country, and until</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a road thrusts itself through the mountains to this remote Mazatec world,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">most Mazatecs will continue to live and die without using the wheel. How</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strange to come upon a people remote from the modern world, still shut in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by their mountains and the barrier of their difficult language, where we can</p>

  <p class="calibre1">see' how our own ancestors lived for most of human history, living almost</p>

  <p class="calibre1">solely in and for the present, but pursuant to patterns transmitted orally from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one generation to another, a people abounding in vitality, intelligent, yet still</p>

  <p class="calibre1">largely untouched by the currents of the modern world!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At breakfast on the morrow after our arrival Don Roberto and RGW took</p>

  <p class="calibre1">249</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_36"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_18">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Herlinda into their confidence and told her the purpose of our visit. She admitted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that she, like her neighbors, had wondered why we were coming. A close friend</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Victoria Pike and Florence Cowan, she had no faith in the sacred mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but she said she would ask her brother-in-law, Aurelio Carreras, widower of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">her late sister, to help us. He turned out to be a one-eyed Indian, about 45 years</p>

  <p class="calibre1">old, the owner of two or three houses built around a patio almost next door.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He had learned Spanish from his wife, but could not read or write it. We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bespoke his help to get the sacred mushrooms for us, and he promised to do his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">best, but the rains had ended prematurely and the mushrooms might be hard to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">find. He warned us to discuss the mushrooms with no one.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We walked through the town. Don Roberto dropped in at a little general</p>

  <p class="calibre1">store, and introduced RGW to the ancient woman behind the counter, Cleofas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cid, an aunt of Herlinda's. When no other customers were about, he asked her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whether she could find the mushrooms for us. She told us that the <i class="calibre4">curandero1</i> who</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had officiated for the party in 1938 had died, and she knew not where to turn</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for another who would accommodate us, but there was Concepcion, the wife</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> who had taken to drink and gone to the dogs. She knew the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms and would get them for us. Concepcion did not speak a word of Spanish.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">- When approaching the Indians with our inquiries, we were careful to speak</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the mushrooms with the deepest respect. (After all, it was a bold thing that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we were doing, strangers probing the innermost religious secrets of this remote</p>

  <p class="calibre1">people. How would a Christian priest receive a pagan's request for samples of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Host?)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Wednesday word reached us from the priest of the huge church on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">plaza that he would like to see us. We had already paid a courtesy visit on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Presidente, a big, tough-looking cacique who spoke good Spanish. Now we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">called on Father Alfonso Aragon. He turned out to be Indian, but Zapotec</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not Mazatec, and with most of his parishioners he could not converse. (In man's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">memory there had never been a Mazatec priest in Huautla.) He was curious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about our visit. We explained our interest in the old customs of the Mazatecs,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and then on his initiative he told us of the strange faith, ridiculous in his eyes,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the townspeople placed in certain mushrooms. Lately a physician in Puebla</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had asked him to forward a kilogram of them. Father Alfonso had succeeded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in laying his hands on the mushrooms, and had wrapped them up. The parcel</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was still there, on the shelf in front of us, for he had lost the address of the Puebla</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. We have found no English word that renders <i class="calibre4">curandero.</i> Medicine man, shaman, witch doctor, sorcerer-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all are misleading. The <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> heals with herbs and engages in divination. <i class="calibre4">Curandero</i> is the respectful designa-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion of which <i class="calibre4">brujo</i> is the pejorative counterpart.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2 5 0</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">physician. Did we care to examine them? We did not conceal our interest,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and quickly untied the parcel. Alas, as was to be expected, the contents were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reduced to a black and putrid mass.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We talked with Victor the muleteer about the mushrooms, and how we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hoped we could consult a <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> in the course of our visit, and he set off</p>

  <p class="calibre1">full of promises, saying he would seek out either of two <i class="calibre4">curanderos</i> whom he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">knew in San Andres.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then we waited.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And as we waited, we picked up more and more information about the sacred</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms. Herlinda talked freely with us. She knew much, though she pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fessed to have little knowledge and certainly she had no faith in them. Victor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the muleteer was captivated by our interest. He and Aurelio and Concepcion</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would come to us separately, often after dark, Aurelio and Concepcion with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">little parcels of a few mushrooms wrapped in banana leaves or a cloth, which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they would deliver to us secretively and reverently. Aurelio and Victor would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">warn us to speak of the matter to no one, for it was <i class="calibre4">muy delicado,</i> Very perilous'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This was the expression they used independently of each other, for we talked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with them always individually, but in the case of Concepcion, as she was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">monolingual, we had to bring in Herlinda to interpret for us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We learned that the Mazatecs are mycophagous and many kinds of edible</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms are offered on market day in the plaza. Each has its own name and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the general word for 'mushroom' is <i class="calibre4">tai3,</i> the <i class="calibre4">t</i> being explosive and each of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vowels being nasalized.1 But this word embraces only mushrooms other than the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sacred ones. Each of the sacred kinds has its own name, and all together they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are called <i class="calibre4">si3to3.</i> This name is invariably preceded by another verbal element so</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the normal expression is, as Miss Pike had told us, <i class="calibre4">'nti1 si3to3,</i> the first</p>

  <p class="calibre1">syllable conveying a sense of deference and affection. (The apostrophe represents</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a glottal stop.) The word <i class="calibre4">si3to3</i> means literally 'that which springs forth', and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">while it is impossible for us to prove that this sense explains the name, in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">context of the sacred mushrooms it is a felicitous mystical metaphor. Victor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">explained the name as meaning "that jwhich comes of itself, no one knows</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whence, like the wind that comes without our knowing whence nor why" - <i class="calibre4">que</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">viene por si mismo, no se sabe de donde, como el viento que viene sin saber de donde ni</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">porque.</i> The word is saturated with <i class="calibre4">mana:</i> it is uttered in a whisper and Victor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was loath to pronounce it at all; when he had to use it, he would substitute a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gesture - his gathered fingers making an eating motion before his mouth.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Mazatec language there seems to be no name for the occupation of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. The superscript digits in Mazatec words indicate the pitch, V being the highest and '4' the lowest.</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_19">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">shaman or <i class="calibre4">curandero.</i> In the proper context one speaks of him as 'he who knows',</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">co'td'ci'ne'.</i> Only on his advice should one eat the sacred mushrooms. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">curandero</i> himself does not necessarily gather the mushrooms; others may do</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this for him. Nor is the gathering attended by prayers and vigils. But according</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to Concepcion the best time to find them in good condition is early in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">morning "when the air is fresh" - <i class="calibre4">con el fresco -</i> a turn of phrase that reminds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us of the 'little breeze before dawn' that Jacinto de la Serna mentioned. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">best time to find them is when the moon is new - <i class="calibre4">la luna tierna.</i> According to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aurelio, in and around Huautla there are today about twenty or thirty <i class="calibre4">curan-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">deros,</i> roughly the same number as in the past, and women are as acceptable as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">men in this function. Usually the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> takes in hand the instruction of his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">son or relative who will succeed him, but this presents no problem, for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">neophyte learns in two or three months. After all, it is the mushroom that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speaks, the mushroom that teaches the beginner what to say and do. The rite</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the sacred mushroom is performed only as an <i class="calibre4">ad hoc</i> consultation, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">prevailing fee when we were in Huautla was from twenty to twenty-five</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pesos, from $2.50 to $3.00. For this service the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> must fast from noon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to noon, and drink no alcohol. He must be (ceremonially) clean, <i class="calibre4">nta3co4ta4.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">He begins his session between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, and does not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">finish before three in the morning. But the trance leaves no unhappy after-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">effects. He can work the next day, and his head is so clear that he remembers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all that he has said in the course of the night.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> eats the mushrooms raw and unwashed and preferably fresh,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but he may conserve them in a dried state for as long as six months. The <i class="calibre4">curan-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">dero</i> eats the mushrooms near the beginning of the seance, and at his discretion</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he may offer them to the family who is in attendance or to the patient whose</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fate is in the balance. Among our informants we found no one who had ever</p>

  <p class="calibre1">heard of a public communal feast of sacred mushrooms. This feature of the cult,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so eloquently described by the old writers, seems obsolete. Here is an important</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alteration in the old customs, and for the change two explanations suggest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">themselves, either of which would be sufficient of itself. For public celebrations</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mushroom could hardly stand the competition of distilled alcohol, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unhappy addiction of the Mazatecs today to strong liquor is sufficient evidence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of this. But there may be another reason. We know that from the earliest times</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Catholic Church exerted itself to the utmost to extirpate the mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cult, and under that threat the use of the mushroom would be driven into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hiding. Indeed this may be the forgotten but once powerful motive behind the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">atmosphere of secrecy that hung over all our discussions during our brief</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">252</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sojourn in Huautla, and what on its face looks like a reverential tabu may</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be merely a legacy of persecution.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How shall we convey the sense of gravity and doom that seemed to hang</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on Aurelio's words when he would whisper to us about the sacred mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the evening ? The mushroom itself 'is speech', <i class="calibre4">es habla,</i> he would say, and it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speaks of many things, of God, of the future, of life and death, and also it tells</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where to find things that are lost. One sees everything, one sees where God</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is also-.se <i class="calibre4">ve todo; se ve donde estd Dios tambien.</i> These were our good friend</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aurelio's very words. We discovered that it is usual to talk of these mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in pairs. The <i class="calibre4">curanderos</i> use four kinds, and each kind has its valence, so to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speak, measuring its potency, and the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> eats so many pairs of this kind,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and a different number of pairs of another; or in case of a shortage, he can</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use two or more kinds, calculating the valence of each to arrive at the right</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dose. We discovered also that each of the four kinds has various specific names,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and not all of our informants knew all of these names, but each was certain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in his own mind of his own names. It is as though in a single community of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">few thousand souls there were various oral traditions using different names,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the traditions did not intermingle and coalesce. On the last day of our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stay in Huautla, Victor arranged for us to pay a visit to Teodoro Garcia, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it was obvious to us from his installation and bearing that he was a 'fashionable'</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">curandero.</i> He told us he was a native of Huautla, yet later we learned from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Herlinda and Aurelio that neither had ever heard of him, and Herlinda sug-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gested that he must hail from San Lucas, a Mazatec village some distance away</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speaking a dialect different from the dialect of Huautla. More probably 'Teodoro</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Garcia' was a fictitious name, invented on the spur of the moment. For the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mazatec his name is part of his very being. He is loath to disclose it, for he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thereby places himself in the other person's power.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was interesting to watch the behavior of our Indian friends as one by one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they would talk to us about the mushrooms lying on the table before us in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shelter of our house. Victor would hold them to his nose and sniff them, and then</p>

  <p class="calibre1">report how much <i class="calibre4">gaz</i> the specimens contained. Aurelio would say of the little</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ones that they had a higher rating - <i class="calibre4">ten tan mas grades -</i> than the larger ones.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They would tell us how many pair were to be eaten of each kind, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">maximum that a strong man might cope with. They told us the specific names</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for each kind, and from the variety of these it was clear that the names were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">euphemistic escapes, metaphors rather than names, metaphors expressing respect</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the course of our expeditions to Mexico we have collected hallucinatory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms of many species, belonging to four genera. Professor Heim has de-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fined them mycologically in the <i class="calibre4">Comptes rendus</i> of the Academic des Sciences,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Institut de France, vol. 242, pp. 965-8 and 1385-95, sessions of March 12 and Fe-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bruary 20, 1956. Here we add only these notes on the kinds used in Huautla.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. Our Huautla specimens included many small mushrooms, some with black and others</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with purple-brown spores. The Indians esteem them highly and the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> will take</p>

  <p class="calibre1">up to 15 or 20 pair. They grow in pastures and in the vicinity of dung but not in dung.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They belong to various species but the Indians do not distinguish among them myco</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logically. In Spanish they are called <i class="calibre4">angelitos;</i> in Mazatec <i class="calibre4">'nti1 si3tho3 ni4se3'4,</i> of which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the distinguishing final element means 'bird'.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. Stropharia sp. This is the largest of the hallucinatory mushrooms used in Huautla, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the least esteemed. It grows directly out of cow's dung. In Spanish it is called the <i class="calibre4">honguillo</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">de San Isidro Labrador,</i> the little mushroom of St. Isidore the Plowman. In Mazatec, Concep-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cion called it the sacred mushroom of the bull's dung, <i class="calibre4">'nti1 si3tho3 y'e4le* nca*ha*.</i> Concep-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cion added that inasmuch as these grow in dung and the first kind around but not in dung,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">people say in Mazatec that these two kinds talk to each other. (See Fig. A).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3. Psilocybe sp. This is an ochraceous spored agaric. It is called in Mazatec <i class="calibre4">'nti1 si3tho3</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">fe/35V, the 'landslide'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"4. We were told repeatedly that another kind of mushroom growing on dead or dying</p>

  <p class="calibre1">trees is used, but we saw no specimens nor could we arrive at the native name.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">As the days went by we felt increasingly disappointed that we were not amass-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing an abundance of the sacred mushrooms. The early ending of the rains had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">made them scarce. RGW depleted our precious store by eating three of the small</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ones and one of the large, but more could not be spared. Bitter to the taste,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they were not sufficient to cause psychic symptoms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We were even more disappointed by our inability to meet any of the <i class="calibre4">curan-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">deros</i> and to engage one to perform the ritual for us. Our Mazatec friends seemed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">slow to bring us into contact with them. Apparently the initial pourparlers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had to be conducted through an intermediary. At any rate, for days no one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. In Mazatec words the apostrophe represents a glottal stop. In <i class="calibre4">sttto^</i> the letter Y has the same value as in Eng-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lish, the value that linguistic specialists conventionally represent by 'th'. Cf. spelling of this word in Miss</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gave us so much as the name of one, and our friends spoke of them like real but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rather mysterious characters who forever remained off stage. Here again there</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is perhaps a legacy of the era of persecution. Twice Victor disappointed us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He announced to us that first one and later another <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> of San Andres</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would minister to us, for a fee somewhat larger than the standard one. In each,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">case the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> failed to keep the engagement.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To justify the ministrations of a <i class="calibre4">curandero,</i> the suppliant must present a specific</p>

  <p class="calibre1">problem on which he needs the advice of the divinatory mushroom. We had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">resolved that our problem lay in our anxiety over our 18 year old son Peter,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">working in an industrial plant outside Boston, from whom no news had reached</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us (naturally enough) since we had left home a few days before. This was not a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">good excuse, but it was the best we could conjure up and it seemed legitimate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to our Indian friends.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our itinerary was going to compel us to leave Huautla not later than Sunday</p>

  <p class="calibre1">morning the i6th. Saturday came, and we still had failed in our efforts to engage</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a <i class="calibre4">curandero.</i> At that point a brilliant idea came to Don Roberto: was it possible</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that Aurelio himself, our one-eyed Indian friend, was a <i class="calibre4">co4ta*ci*ne4</i> ? Hardly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had Don Roberto advanced this conjecture than Aurelio himself came into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">view, his sarape over his shoulder, approaching us discreetly with that quiet</p>

  <p class="calibre1">measured gait that by now we knew so well. We felt indebted to him for all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he had done for us. Now the big test was to come. We chatted with him, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then, quite casually, Don Roberto asked:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"And tell us, Aurelio, when you give treatments <i class="calibre4">[hace curaciones],</i> are they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">successful?"</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"Yes", he answered, "always."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For days we had been talking with a <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> all unawares.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Roberto went right on. "Will you help us tonight?" Aurelio hesitated.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He needed time to think the matter over. Why was he undecided? Was he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perhaps ceremonially unclean? Was it because we were aliens to him and his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">people? Or was it because Herlinda's mother lay dying in the house and he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was not in the mood? He went away and consulted Herlinda. This she told us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">later, explaining that her mother's condition was what had held him back,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but she had advised him that we had come from afar, in need of the secret</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of his people, and he should help us. He came back to us, and told us to be ready</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at 9 o'clock in the evening. Then he went on to explain to us that different</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">curanderos</i> had different styles in performing the ritual. Some chant and sing and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">even shout. His own style, he said, was simple: he always remained composed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and never raised his voice. But the mushroom speaks only in Mazatec, and he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would have to have his son Demetrio with him. to interpret the mushroom's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words for us. Before leaving us he obtained our assurance that we would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discuss the matter with no outsiders in Huautla.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the dot of 9 o'clock that evening Aurelio called for us, just as the last</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rays of daylight were vanishing. He led us by a short-cut across a corn patch</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">milpa</b></i> to his houses, and we entered the door that he led us to. For hours</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we were to remain in the little room, perhaps eight feet square, where we now</p>

  <p class="calibre1">found ourselves. In front of us was a kind of shelf or mantel or altar. On the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">right there was a crudely carpentered wooden bedstead. Under it lay two small</p>

  <p class="calibre1">children, Aristeo and Julia Elvira, sleeping on a mat. Someone gently pulled the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mat with them on it over the dirt floor to the other side of the partition that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bisected the house. We were four in our own party. Then there was Aurelio and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his grown-up son Demetrio (Figure B, i), and Demetrio's young and pretty</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre5">Fig. B</b></p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">wife Clara (2), who lay on the floor in her clothes and wrapped in her sarape,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and who seemed to doze through the night. Next to her lay her baby, born</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on June 4 and still nameless, for she was as yet unbaptized. Clara seemed to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">doze, but when her husband Demetrio faltered in translating the words of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom, she had a way of interposing the Spanish words that he was seeking.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We were eight in all, with the two children around the corner making ten.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The setting for us' strangers had its unusual aspects. Throughout the long cere-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mony the only illumination inside the room came from tapers or an oil wick,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and sometimes from a single taper, and for more than an hour we sat in complete</p>

  <p class="calibre1">darkness and silence. The air grew foul, for the bean-eating Indians are not an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inhibited people. After n o'clock a terrifying rain storm with thunder and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lightning broke on Huautla, and through the knot-holes and chinks of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">flimsy board walls of our hut the lightning would suddenly reveal every detail</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the room and the huddled figures in it. After the storm ended there was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">more excitement. A shot was fired in the night and Demetrio cried out, " <i class="calibre4">Un</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">homicidio"</i> -a murder! Then there was the running of naked feet in the path</p>

  <p class="calibre1">256</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">outside our house, a loud knocking at a door not far away, and three more shots,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but not a single human voice. Throughout the storm and the shooting Aurelio</p>

  <p class="calibre1">proceeded deliberately with the ritual.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With Aurelio's permission Don Roberto and RGW were taking notes, Ro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">berto's being especially full and accurate. The following description is based</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the notes that we both took. The successive steps seemed interminable, so</p>

  <p class="calibre1">slow were they, but each was executed with nice care for detail. There were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">knots to be tied, and then Aurelio sought the aid of his son, doubtless because</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his single eye made the tying too difficult. We shall describe the ritual as ac-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">curately as we can, and analogies with other religions may occur to the reader</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at certain points, especially when the mushrooms are consumed. But need we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">warn him that such analogies and correspondences are superficial; Students</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of religious rituals often observe similar gestures and acts in unrelated religions.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The similarity is accidental. A given ritual is stamped with meaning by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">myths, the theology, the creed, the emotional responses, the whole cosmology</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peculiar to the culture that has evolved it. The ritual of the divinatory mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must be interpreted against the background of all the religious beliefs and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">practices of the Indians of Middle America, an absorbing subject far too complex</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and difficult for us to cope with. Though we could not enter into the subjective</p>

  <p class="calibre1">associations that the ritual evokes in Mazatec believers, it was easy for us to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perceive the mystery that bathes each successive step in the ceremony. For us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as mycophiles and ethno-mycologists it was a stirring event to see our Mazatec</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">curandero</i> reverently raise the mushrooms from the cloth, pair after pair, a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom in either hand held by the stipe; and then see him eat the pair,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">first one and then the other, beginning with the pileus and then the greater</p>

  <p class="calibre1">part of the stipe, masticating each mouthful of the fresh raw mushroom a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">long time and then swallowing it, and depositing the stub of the stipe carefully</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in a piece of paper on one side. Yes, the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> eats first one mushroom and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then the other, holding one of the pair in either hand, exactly as the illustrator</p>

  <p class="calibre1">represented the act in the Magliabechiano manuscript. What we saw confirmed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the meaning of that picture. What we saw was consistent with the hearsay</p>

  <p class="calibre1">accounts of the ritual handed down to us by Motolinia and Jacinto de la Serna.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It confirmed in all essentials the account given by the late Jean Bassett Johnson</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the performance that he and his party attended in Huautla on the night</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of July 16, 1938, fifteen years and one month before our experience.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jrlere then is the order of the ritual of the divinatory mushroom as we witnessed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and recorded it in Huautla de Jimenez. Our drawings were made by Robert</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Weitlaner, and we are grateful to him for allowing us to use them and his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">notes. Our plate in color giving an impressionistic grouping of the accessories</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the rite was done by VPW.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though the room has a kind of altar, the entire ritual takes place on the floor,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with Aurelio seated most of the time on a small, low stool (Figure B, 4). Later,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when he consumes the mushrooms, he is kneeling on his folded sarape. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">front of the altar and slightly to the right of center, he begins by laying a sack</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the ground, and on it a square of cheap yellow sateen, and on top of this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">another layer of heavier material, dark blue, probably from a <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">rebozo</b></i> or shawl (3).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We are lighted at first by a wick in an oil tin. Someone brings in a few glowing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">embers, which are placed in an old potsherd on the ground between the altar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the blue material. From first to last, except for the utterances and the long</p>

  <p class="calibre1">silences, the ritual consists of the ceremonial handling of accessories that are laid</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out on the blue cloth. Of these accessories all save the mushrooms can be seen</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for sale in the market place every day and are familiar to students of Middle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">American religious practices. These accessories are:1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. Lumps of copal, a pale resin used as incense.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. A handful of cacao beans.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3. A handful of maize kernels. (The precise number in our case is 53.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">4. A heap of <i class="calibre4">pisiete -</i> ground green tobacco.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">5. Four hen's eggs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">6. Two speckled <i class="calibre4">guajolote</i> (Mexican turkey) eggs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">7. Two brilliant feathers of the <i class="calibre4">guacamaya</i> bird, a kind of parrot.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">8. Six rolls of bark paper, called <i class="calibre4">amate.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Also tapers of virgin wax.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">These with fourteen pair of mushrooms make up the accessories, and initially</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. One of the <i class="calibre4">curanderos</i> in San Andres had told us through Victor that, in addition to the other accessories, we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should provide a chicken. This suggests the possibility that some <i class="calibre4">curanderos</i> sacrifice a fowl during the rite.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2 5 8</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they are laid out on the blue material as shown in Figure C. Aurelio takes a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">long time to arrange all this. He counts the mushrooms and the cacao beans,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and then places five cacao beans next to each hen's egg and 13 next to each of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the two turkey eggs. He divides the maize kernels roughly in half, picks up half,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shakes them from hand to hand, casts them on the cloth, contemplates them,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">repeats the same steps with the other half, and separates out the two grains that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he says are the Wasson children. He asks whether we are in agreement with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what goes on and we say yes. He casts the kernels again, and a third time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Speaking of Peter, Aurelio says, in Demetrio's translation, <i class="calibre4">"Estd, pero iquien</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">sake donde esta?" -</i> He is, but who knows where he is? It is now 10.15 o'clock.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">To each of us he gives a piece of <i class="calibre4">copal</i> to hold in a clenched fist, and to VPW</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he gives two, one for Peter; then on his bidding we toss the copal into the embers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">glowing in the potsherd.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aurelio kneels on his folded <i class="calibre4">sarape,</i> crosses himself, invokes the Trinity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and some of the saints, takes a pair of mushrooms, holds them briefly over the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">burning copal, and begins to chew them. Now only a single taper is burning,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">aided by light from the embers. After chewing for a time, he swallows, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then does the same with the rest of the mushrooms, pair by pair, until 14 pair</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are consumed. He finishes eating them at 10.30 o'clock. He has now eaten u</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pair of the large ones and three pair of the others. Having finished the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms, he binds his head tightly in a kerchief.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Throughout the night Aurelio's utterances are in a conversational tone,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Mazatec for the most part but toward the end in Spanish. VPW, being</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a physician, has arrived in Huautla equipped to examine the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> during</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the performance with stethoscope, thermometer, blood-pressure gauge, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ophthalmoscope. Now that the moment has come, for many reasons each</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alone sufficient it seems hardly wise to inject these extraneous and exotic utensils</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into the proceedings. Aurelio breathes heavily and audibly, and his single eye</p>

  <p class="calibre1">often disappears for long stretches behind its closed lid. Aurelio's whole de-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meanor expresses concentration of mental effort. From first to last he manifests</p>

  <p class="calibre1">no unmistakable symptoms of trance or inebriation, but by this we do not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wish to be understood as denying psychic effects from the mushrooms. Here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is a matter that calls for serious study under controls.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Immediately after consuming the 14 pair of mushrooms Aurelio takes the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and along with 13 cacao beans wraps it tightly in the paper, the end of the feather</p>

  <p class="calibre1">extending beyond the paper wrapping. He makes a neat little bundle, which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he ties up with cotton threads that Clara has been preparing for him (Figure</p>

  <p class="calibre1">E). He puts the parcel by the side of one of the turkey eggs. He repeats this</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">with a second parcel and the second turkey egg. He puts the eggs back where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they have been with the two parcels lying between them. Then Aurelio makes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">four smaller bundles, cutting out small rectangular pieces <i class="calibre4">of amate,</i> wrapping up</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in each one the piece of feather and five (instead of 13) cacao beans. The six</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing mushrooms are producing the desired effects while Aurelio busies himself</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with these duties.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aurelio rolls up his sleeves, takes the <i class="calibre4">pisiete</i> or finely ground green tobacco,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rubs it on his forearms, then on his exposed belly, the top of his head, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">back of his neck. He takes matches and places them beside the eggs. He picks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">up the kernels of maize and casts them with the right hand. He pauses as in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thought, breathes deeply and audibly. He rises and then sits down on the stool,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wrapping his sarape around him. He sits in thought. He asks where Peter is,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and RGW replies that Peter is in Boston. It is now 11.05 o'clock.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aurelio rises and goes to the dark corner near the door, where he sits down</p>

  <p class="calibre1">260</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on a chair. The last waxen taper is now extinguished and we remain in complete</p>

  <p class="calibre1">darkness until 1.05 o'clock in the morning. The storm breaks on Huautla.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aurelio spits on his hands and rubs them together. He asks where we left Peter,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in whose house. We tell him. He asks if it is agreeable to us that he should ask</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these questions, and we say yes. At about this time the shooting and the running</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by our hut take place.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wrapped in his sarape, Aurelio sits on his chair deep in thought. He asks a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">series of simple questions about Peter, says he has trouble seeing Peter because</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he is so far away in a city big and strange. Finally he says that Peter is alive but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'they' are reaching out for him to send him to war. Possibly 'they' won't</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'get' (= <i class="calibre4">aganar)</i> him, but it is hard to say. Germany seems to enter into the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">situation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then Aurelio declares that Peter is in New York, not in Boston; that Peter's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thoughts are on us, that he is in a turmoil, that he is well but in a difficulty that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he can hardly cope with, that his thoughts are on us to the point of tears, that he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is stumbling, that he is not used to this difficulty where he finds himself, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">does not know how to go about writing us about it. Then Aurelio says suddenly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that we may smoke, and the room is soon illuminated faintly by two cigars.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At about this point VPW and Masha, tired and sleepy, express a wish to go</p>

  <p class="calibre1">home. We have been warned by Victor that no one is ever allowed to leave</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the ritual before it is done, even to the point that necessities must be performed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the room itself with rude accommodations there provided. But Aurelio</p>

  <p class="calibre1">says that he can conjure away any dangers. RGW is uncertain whether Aurelio</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is referring to supernatural dangers, or the dangers on the path to the other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">house. Apparently to assure their protection, Aurelio holds each of them in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">turn for a long time by her right forearm, rubs the forearm with <i class="calibre4">pisiete,</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">takes the pulse <i class="calibre4">with his thumb.</i> (Physicians always take the pulse with the fingers,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for in the thumb there is a pulse beat that would confuse the count of the patient's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pulse.) Demetrio accompanies them through the <i class="calibre4">milpa</i> to the cottage.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At 1.05 Aurelio lights the four tapers and contemplates the flames. He gives</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to Don Roberto and RGW a piece of copal each, stirs the embers in the potsherd,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">asks us to throw our copal on the embers, and under his breath utters a prayer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or incantation. He asks us if we believe in one true God, and we so affirm.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He holds the four tapers in his two hands, and then asks Demetrio to hold them,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">declaring then that nothing bad has happened to Peter. He asks how many are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">present - "Only four?" He asks whether one o'clock has passed, and when we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">say yes, he comments, <i class="calibre4">"Ya es buena hora"</i> -now a good hour has come. Then</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he asks RGW whether he believes in all that is going on here. Inexperienced,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">261</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_48"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_24">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">RGW begins to reply weakly that he thinks he believes, whereupon the ex-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perienced Don Roberto overtakes his words and in a deep, resonant, loud</p>

  <p class="calibre1">voice declares, <i class="calibre4">"Creemos".</i> Then Aurelio declares in a sure voice that nothing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is wrong with Peter and that all goes well. A little later he says that what we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are all witnessing is <i class="calibre4">"muy delicado" -</i> most perilous, and that of course we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are not used to all this. He says that he can render treatment in absentia on our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">behalf, after we leave Huautla, and in fact he recommends that we ask him to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">do this. It is now 1.30 o'clock.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aurelio mixes the maize kernels in his two hands, casts half of them and then</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the other half, and then all the kernels at one time, and then all the kernels a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">second time. He places one of the hen's eggs toward the left side of the cloth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and casts the kernels for the fifth time. He places one of the large eggs on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">right hand side, and points it in the direction that he says is east. He asks RGW</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when he will arrive in Mexico City and whether he has a house there. He casts</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the kernels again, for the sixth time, and then arranges the eggs and bundles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the fashion indicated in Figure G. Then he declares that a relative of RGW</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">is destined to fall seriously ill within the year, and he gravely fixes on RGW</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his single eye. It is now 1.45 o'clock.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Demetrio replenishes the supply of copal in the potsherd. Aurelio leaves the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room a moment, taking some <i class="calibre4">pisiete</i> with him. He returns and again casts the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kernels. One kernel happens to stand on end. Aurelio concentrates his attention</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on it, saying it is RGW's son. Then he repeats that a relative of RGW is destined</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">to fall ill within the year. Then he asks RGW whether he can carry bundle no.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I to his home and keep it for 13 days, along with the corresponding egg. On the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I4th day RGW may throw them into water or bury them. Aurelio takes one of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the turkey eggs and to the blunt end affixes a small lump of copal, which being</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hot and soft appears to adhere to the egg shell securely. He does the same with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">each of the hen's eggs and finally the other turkey egg. He places the eggs and</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">bundles as shown in Fig. H, but immediately shifts three of the small bundles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the places shown by the arrows. It is now 2.10 o'clock.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In another potsherd Aurelio stands the four tapers upright, and he asks RGW</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to sit on the chair and roll up his sleeves. Aurelio passes the potsherd with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">embers over RGW's head, along with two of the eggs and two bundles, praying</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the while, and then he gives the two bundles and eggs to RGW to hold in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">both his hands. He passes the potsherd under RGW's hands, and Demetrio</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stirs the embers. Aurelio then passes the potsherd with copal over RGW's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">head, then over the ground, then over his head and under his hands, repeating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all this several times, relieving RGW of the eggs and bundles but only to hand</p>

  <p class="calibre1">him another pair of eggs and bundles; asking him then the name of his daughter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and repeating the various passes, always making all the passes counter-clockwise.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then Aurelio empties the paper containing the stubs of mushrooms into the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fire of the potsherd. He gives this little paper bag to RGW along with a second</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one, both containing now some <i class="calibre4">pisiete,</i> and he says to RGW that they contain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">something good from St. Peter and St. Paul. At this stage in the night Aurelio</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is speaking Spanish or Mazatec, passing from one to the other without apparent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reason, and he addresses RGW with the familiar <i class="calibre4">tu</i> instead of the formal <i class="calibre4">Usted.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is now 2.25 o'clock.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then Aurelio gives RGW certain specific instructions. The turkey egg with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">copal on the blunt end is for him, and similarly a chicken egg for VPW, each</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with its respective bundle. These are to be held for 13 days, and then the eggs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must be buried with the pointed end down and with the corresponding bundle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">buried next to each, perpendicularly, the bundle to be carefully placed on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">eastern</i> side of the respective egg. In the course of the closing phases of the ritual,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aurelio observes that <i class="calibre4">pisiete</i> is excellent for stomach troubles and that one may</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eat a little of it. He himself puts something in his mouth, between teeth and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cheeks, and presumably this is <i class="calibre4">pisiete.</i></p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_50"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_25">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">At 2.30 o'clock the session draws to a close, and Don Roberto with RGW</p>

  <p class="calibre1">leave the house to return to their own.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Before 7 o'clock on the following morning we were all in the saddle and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">away. Aurelio and Herlinda had arisen betimes, Herlinda to serve us breakfast</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and bid us godspeed. We rewarded Aurelio for his night-long vigil with us,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">giving him 120 pesos or about $ 15, plus a few pesos for the cost of the accessories</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that he had used in the ritual - a princely sum for him which we did not be-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grudge. These good people waved us on our way, and we shall long remember</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their friendliness and help.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On our way out of the Mazatec country we spent the first night in the village</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of San Bernardino, lodging with the owner of the general store, Dona Toribia</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cid de Mendes. This is the village, perched high on the edge of the mountains,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that looks far down over the low-lying plain to the west of the Mazatec country.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After we had eaten our tortillas and eggs and as we sipped our coffee and mescal,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dona Toribia captured our attention with stories of the Mazatecs. She was her-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">self a Spanish-speaking Mazatec from Mazatlan. Before long she got on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">subject of the miraculous mushrooms, and she went on and on until late in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">night about the miracles they had worked in those mountains to the east, now</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sleeping in darkness, until in the end it seemed as though the very hills them-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">selves, where the little mushrooms grow, were bewitched by them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jhlere we should prefer to bring our story of Huautla to an end, but candor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">compels us to add a few more lines. Our attitude toward the divinatory perfor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mance and especially the oracular utterances had been one of kindly condescen-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sion. We said to ourselves that it was cruel on our part to ask Aurelio, locked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">up in his unlettered Indian world, to enter understandingly into the problems</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Wassons of New York. His divinatory powers, put to this appalling test,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had seemed to us pitifully thin, but of course we had duly entered in our notes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all that he had said. In brief, he had declared that Peter was not in Boston but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in New York, that Peter was alive but in a deep emotional crisis and longing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for our help, and finally that the army was reaching out for him and might</p>

  <p class="calibre1">yet get him. There was a hint of foreign military service - Germany was men-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tioned. Later in the night Aurelio predicted ominously that a member of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wasson family would be gravely ill within the year.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We reached home in the second week of September. In the kitchen of our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">New York apartment we found the leavings of a party that during our absence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Peter and his friends had held. The bills from the purveyors supplied the date:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the weekend of August 15-16! Peter easily confirmed this when we saw him.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">264</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Laughingly we credited the sacred mushrooms with a hit, a palpable hit, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then gave the matter no more thought.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aurelio's prediction about the army had seemed badly aimed. After all,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Peter at the age of 17 had enlisted in the National Guard, and this gave him</p>

  <p class="calibre1">exemption from the draft. Soon after our return to New York, RGW left</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for Europe on a business trip, and late in the morning of Monday, October 3,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he arrived at the Hotel du Rhone in Geneva. There a cablegram from home</p>

  <p class="calibre1">awaited him with sensational news: Peter had just made known his settled deter-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mination to enlist in the regular army for a three year term. He had come to this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">decision after a prolonged emotional crisis involving a girl, and that crisis, we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">now learned, had been boiling while we were in Mexico. Would RGW please</p>

  <p class="calibre1">send a cablegram at once begging Peter to postpone his rash step ? RGW sent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the message but, before it reached Peter, he had signed up. The army, after all,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had reached out and got hold of him! At the moment of the October crisis our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thoughts were so far removed from Huautla that days passed before suddenly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Aurelio's pronouncement came to mind. Another hit, a palpable one indeed!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A few months later, after the usual training period, the army sent Peter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">abroad for duty, but to Japan not Germany.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There remained one final prediction: grave illness was to strike the Wasson</p>

  <p class="calibre1">family within the twelvemonth. (In the Mazatec world the 'family' embraces</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all the kin.) This seemed on its face unlikely, for our families are unusually</p>

  <p class="calibre1">small. No one of the previous generation survives. VPW had only a brother</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and a sister and some nieces, as well as a few cousins and their children. RGW</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had only five first cousins and four first cousins once removed. In January one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of RGW's first cousins, in his 4o's and abounding in vitality, suddenly died</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from heart failure.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We record, as in duty we are bound to do, but without further comment,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these strange sequelae to our Huautla visit.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On January 14, 1954, Robert Weitlaner wrote us exciting news: his daughter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Irmgard Johnson had recently returned from a journey through the Mije</p>

  <p class="calibre1">country, and in San Juan Mazatlan a <i class="calibre4">curandero,</i> through an interpreter, had told</p>

  <p class="calibre1">her about two kinds of sacred mushrooms. The Mije are known as a remote</p>

  <p class="calibre1">people, shut off from the world and in turn disposed to shut out the world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Among them the mushroom cult might manifest archaic traits, and in any</p>

  <p class="calibre1">case would give us perspective on the Mazatec practices. Would we care to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">join him on a second pilgrimage in quest of the secrets of the sacred mushrooms ?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The proposal was too tempting to resist, and through further correspondence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">265</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_52"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_26">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">the details were worked out for a fast incursion into the Mijeria, as the land of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mije is called.1 It proved impossible for VPW and Masha to leave New York,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but others were recruited to take their places. Allan B. Richardson, a friend and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">photographer of New York, eagerly accepted the challenge and prepared</p>

  <p class="calibre1">himself to serve as official photographer. The Summer Institute of Linguistics</p>

  <p class="calibre1">consented to let Walter S. Miller join us: a professional linguist, he is the foremost</p>

  <p class="calibre1">student of the Mije language and culture. For guide, Don Roberto enlisted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Francisco Ortega, known as Chico, a thirty-nine year old Zapotec living in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tehuantepec, whose extraordinary talents and character have given him an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">outstanding reputation among all who explore seriously in the remoter regions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Oaxaca and Chiapas. He in turn engaged a boy named Filemon to help</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the animals, three horses and a mule.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Among those who know about the Indians of Mexico, the Mije enjoy a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">legendary reputation. It is said of them that in the old days of Zapotec power,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">centuries ago, the Mije stood off the Zapotecs, and the Spaniards never subdued</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them in war. They are seldom visited. Even famous writers about the Mexican</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indians like Miguel Covarrubias discuss them by hearsay, never undertaking</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the arduous journey to their mountain villages. Their language for Europeans</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is of the utmost difficulty, with stress, quantity, and tone, palatalization, glottal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stops, retroflexion, and numerous consonants unfamiliar to English or Russian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ears. It belongs to a group of which the others are the Popoluca of Vera Cruz,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Zoque, and the dying or extinct Tapachultec. Some 60,000 in number, the Mije</p>

  <p class="calibre1">live in the mountains of northeastern Oaxaca, these mountains rising to their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peak in the famed Zempoaltepetl, almost 3,400 meters high. These mountains</p>

  <p class="calibre1">constitute part of the rugged massif where the Mazatecs live also, but the two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peoples are far removed from each other. By comparison the Mazatecs are well</p>

  <p class="calibre1">advanced toward incorporation in the great world, and the two peoples are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">separated from each other by no less than three tribes. Next to the Mazatecs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the east live the Cuicatecs, then the Chinantecs, then a swath of Zapotecs,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and at last come the Mije. To the east of the Mije he their kin the Zoques in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chiapas and the whole world of the Maya. For us it might prove significant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that this people shut off from the world had always been a culture contiguous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the Maya tribes. The reputation of the Mije is that while not aggressive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they are uncommunicative with outsiders and even surly. For the most part</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they live at altitudes below 1,500 meters, and their mountains are clothed in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. We use the spelling 'Mije' rather than 'Mixe', favored of scholars, because the value of the 'j' is that of standard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spanish, whereas 'x' in Mexico represents any of three consonants. The Mije must not be mistaken for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unrelated Mixtecs, of course.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tropical vegetation and abound in wild life. They live on maize and beans,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chickens and turkeys, and they sell to the outside world a small amount of good</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coffee. In all of the Mijeria there is not a single road for wheeled vehicles.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On Friday, May 21, RGW flew to Mexico City with Allan Richardson.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the following day, by the gracious generosity of the Banco Nacional de</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mexico, the bank's De Havilland Dove with Captain Carlos Borja piloting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lifted us to the airstrip at Ixtepec in the Isthmus, having stopped at Oaxaca on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the way to pick up Walter Miller. At Ixtepec we met Don Roberto and Chico.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After laying in some provisions at Ixtepec and Juchitan, we drove by car east-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ward along the Pan American highway, then north on the Trans-Isthmian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">highway, and finally westward down an execrable road through Laguna to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Santo Domingo Petapa, a stretch of about fifty-five miles. This Zapotec village</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was our stepping-off point. Next day we set out for San Juan Mazatlan, some-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times called Mazatlan de los Mijes. After a long day we spent the first night</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sleeping in the school house at Platanillo. Then followed another long day of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">slow progress up mountains and down, and across arroyos. We slept the second</p>

  <p class="calibre1">night in the forest, and the following day shortly after noon we entered Maza-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tlan. From Platanillo to Mazatlan we had met only four Indians and had not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seen a single habitation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We happened on Mazatlan during the annual fiesta in honor of the Virgen</p>

  <p class="calibre1">de la Soledad. The village was thronged with Indians bedecked in their finest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">garbs and there was much music, dancing, and drinking. The thatched</p>

  <p class="calibre1">houses of the village, perhaps two hundred in number, are strung along the ridges</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of radiating mountain spurs, the mountain sides themselves being clothed in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tropical vegetation and alive with brilliantly colored and highly vocal birds.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On all sides the distant horizon is closed in with superb mountains. The altitude</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the town is about 3000 feet.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We made our way to the Municipio, where we found the Presidente, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Secretario, and the Sindico busily engaged in supervising the progress of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fiesta. They received us with reserve, but after we showed our credentials they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">informed us that we might occupy the <i class="calibre4">curato,</i> the house that would belong to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the priest if there were one, a one-room thatched adobe structure adjacent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the thatched church. This suited us admirably, and there we stayed for six</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. There exists one excellent study of the Mije and their culture, <i class="calibre4">Ethnology of the Western Mixe,</i> by Ralph L.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Beals, University of California Press, 1945. Being of Anglo-Saxon origin, this excellent and respected ethno-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logist naturally failed to inquire about the role of mushrooms in theMije culture. The divinatory cult complete-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ly eluded his attention. He dealt only with the western Mije, in Ayutla and thereabouts. The Popoluca-Zoque</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cultures were described by Frans Blom and Oliver La Farge in <i class="calibre4">Tribes and Temples,</i> Tulane University,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Louisiana, 1926. They also seem to have made no ethno-mycological inquiries.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">days while we pursued our inquiries and took photographs. Allan Richardson</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with his cameras proved a sensational attraction for the Indians, whose reserve</p>

  <p class="calibre1">broke down as they besought him for <i class="calibre4">retratos</i> or 'portraits', and paved the way</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for our inquiries. We found that there were eleven <i class="calibre4">curanderos</i> in Mazatlan,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">four of them women. We talked with four of the men. Don Roberto and RGW</p>

  <p class="calibre1">called on one of the oldest, Francisco Policarpo, in his home, where we found</p>

  <p class="calibre1">him reclining in his hammock. He knew no Spanish, and through a feeble</p>

  <p class="calibre1">interpreter we finally learned that in his practice he had long since given up</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the use of mushrooms, relying instead on a certain <i class="calibre4">bejuco,</i> a plant of some kind,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">either a creeper or a climber, perhaps the <i class="calibre4">ololiuqui.</i> We also visited the <i class="calibre4">curan-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">dero</i> from whom Irmgard Johnson had learned in January of the use of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">divinatory mushroom among the Mije, a discovery for which priority goes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to her. She had known him as Francisco Jose, but with us he was Francisco</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Claudio. He remembered Mrs. Johnson's visit well. He spoke almost no Spanish,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and his brother Alvaro was to interpret for us, but Alvaro was so sullen that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our interview was a failure. We were fortunate, however, when another of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">curanderos,</i> Manuel Agustin, came to us with various ailments for treatment:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Walter was skillful with massage and manipulation, and also relieved his pains</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with analgesics, whereupon the old man answered patiently all our inquiries.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The <i class="calibre4">Vocal</i> of the town, Felipe Luciano, a leading citizen, also proved friendly,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and persuaded the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> Timoteo Quirino to discuss mushrooms with us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In addition to these local informants, we were the beneficiaries of a windfall, a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">delegation from another Mije village of whom we shall speak later.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The divinatory mushrooms play a role among the Mije as important as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among the Mazatecs, with many similarities and many important differences.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Like the Mazatecs, the Mije always speak of these mushrooms in pairs. For</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'pair' they use in their language a word borrowed from Spanish, <i class="calibre4">casada,</i> which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is invariable as to number and which in Mije is used only when 'pair' means</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a couple of opposite sexes. Here then is evidence suggesting that in the Middle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">American mushroom cult, the habitual pairing of the sacred mushrooms car-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ries a sexual connotation. For this there is support also in a folk tale from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">town of San Lucas Camotlan, which we shall recount shortly. But we must add</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that in Mazatec the word for a 'pair' of mushrooms, <i class="calibre4">nka2,</i> has apparently no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sexual association.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Huautla our <i class="calibre4">curandero,</i> as he ate the mushrooms, bit off the caps and all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but the butt of the stipes, chewing them thoroughly and then swallowing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them. Among the Mije this is done differently. The caps are severed by hand</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the stipes; the stipes are firmly attached to the caps and, for their size,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">268</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tough. The stipes are put back into <i class="calibre4">thcjicara</i> or gourd bowl, while the caps are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quickly swallowed, without chewing, one after the other. If the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">do not take effect, then the suppliant addresses a prayer to the stipes in their</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">jtcara,</i> and eats more caps. Afterwards <i class="calibre4">the jicara</i> with the stipes is carried to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nearby cross and there, reverently, the stipes are spilled out as an offering,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and a <i class="calibre4">vela</i> is lighted. All of our informants stressed the separation of the caps</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the stems and the separate use of each.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The mushrooms come only during the rains of June and July, and they can</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be kept in a dried condition for only fifteen or twenty days. This limits their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use to a short season. We arrived unhappily before the rains and we saw no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">specimens, nor could we see them in use. We were told that in the hot low</p>

  <p class="calibre1">country the mushrooms do not grow. The atmosphere of secrecy about the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms that was so striking in Huautla is less heavy in Mazatlan, perhaps</p>

  <p class="calibre1">because this remoter people had never come under such close control by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ecclesiastical authorities. Indeed, there seemed no particular reluctance to discuss</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mushrooms. On the other hand, the mushrooms are consumed in private,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the dead of night, if possible under conditions of absolute quiet, usually</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with only two persons present, the one who eats them and another. As in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mazatec country, among the Mije we discovered no trace of a communal agape</p>

  <p class="calibre1">such as the early writers described.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Huautla the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> eats the mushrooms on behalf of his patient or client.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here lies the vital difference with the Mije. For in the Mije country the <i class="calibre4">curan-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">dero</i> never eats the mushrooms, except as he himself may wish to consult them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The sick person eats them, or the person who seeks tidings of absent relatives</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or help in finding lost and stolen property. Among the Mije the divinatory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom carries no hieratic attributes; it is secular. Everyone knows how to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use the mushroom and the <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> is not usually a party to the performance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Like the Mazatecs, the Mije possess a general term that embraces all of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">divinatory species, but unlike them the Mije consider these species as a subdivision</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the order of mushrooms. In Mije the word for 'mushrooms' is <i class="calibre4">mus,</i> and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">collective word for all divinatory mushrooms is <i class="calibre4">na :swin mus,</i> of which the first</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word means the World, the Universe. This word enfolds a curious figure of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speech: <i class="calibre4">na:s</i> means 'ground' and <i class="calibre4">win</i> means 'eye'. (Here and in other words the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">colon means that the preceding vowel is long in quantity.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Manuel Agustin, an old man, disclosed to us a surprising fact: for <i class="calibre4">na:swin mus</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">there is a synonym, <i class="calibre4">tu:muh.</i> Our friend Felipe was helping Walter as our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">interpreter with Manuel, and Felipe changed the word to <i class="calibre4">tu:m 'ungk,</i> which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">another elder of the town, Geronimo Antonio, later confirmed. They and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">269</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_56"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_28">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">others knew the word and its meaning, and they all agreed that its inner sense</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was 'that which is born of itself', <i class="calibre4">lo aue nace por si mismo.</i> Here is the same figure</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that we find in the Mazatec <i class="calibre4">si3to31 Tu:m</i> of itself means nothing in Mije and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">occurs elsewhere only in the distinctive Mije calendar of day names, where in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">complicated rotation of the native calendar it might turn up in the combination</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tu:m 'uh.</i> The term seems to be an archaism, with mystical implications that will</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have to be explored by further study.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Both Manuel and Timoteo agreed that there are three species of divinatory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, and their descriptions tallied also:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. <i class="calibre4">pi:tpa,</i> 'thread-like', the smallest, perhaps two horizontal fingers high, with a cap</p>

  <p class="calibre1">small for the height, growing almost anywhere, often by the side of the mountain trails.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Where one is found more should be sought. The cap is yellowish above and blackish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">below, and hemispherical.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. <i class="calibre4">atka:t,</i> 'alcalde' or Mayor; like the <i class="calibre4">pi:tpa</i> but bigger, three or four fingers high,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with a flatter cap.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3. <i class="calibre4">kong</i> or <i class="calibre4">kongk,</i> the 'chief or 'head-man', which is the biggest, perhaps eight fingers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">high with a stem % inch in diameter, the color of the' cap being more yellow than</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the others.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our informants agreed that the three kinds differ as to species and not merely</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in age. They agreed that these mushrooms, eaten raw (either fresh or dried),</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have an agreeable odor like flowers. The taste is like nothing else. One in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">formant said that in the throat they felt like soda water. As for the dose, every</p>

  <p class="calibre1">man figures it out according to his tolerance for <i class="calibre4">mescal.</i> Of the <i class="calibre4">pi:tpa,</i> some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">take six pair, but others take eight, ten, or even twelve; of the <i class="calibre4">atka:t,</i> from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">three to six pair; of the <i class="calibre4">kong,</i> if two mushrooms are available, one eats around</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the edge of the two caps; but if only one is available, then one entire cap.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Anyone may gather the mushrooms. On finding them you may send a sigh</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of thanks to God, but this is as you please. On the evening when they are to be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eaten, toward nightfall, you carry them in <i class="calibre4">ajicara</i> to the church. If the church</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is locked, you seek out <i class="calibre4">the fiscal</i> or <i class="calibre4">mayordomo</i> and he opens it for you. On the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">altar you place the <i class="calibre4">jicara</i> with the mushrooms, and burn <i class="calibre4">copal</i> or incense, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">either one <i class="calibre4">vela</i> or three. You invoke God's blessing and his permission to consult</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mushrooms, and you promise him alms, one peso or two or two and a half.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then you bear the mushrooms to the house. A house on the edge of the village</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is best, where all will be quiet. You place the mushrooms in <i class="calibre4">the jicara</i> on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ground before the household altar, with one <i class="calibre4">vela</i> burning. Someone now goes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">back to the church with the promised alms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The person who is to eat the mushrooms has been on a ceremonially restricted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">270</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">diet for four days. According to Timoteo, for four days you cannot take coffee</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or liquor, nor eat of any fowl, nor eggs, nor anything fat, nor flesh of pig.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But you may eat beef and beans and maize <i class="calibre4">(tortilla</i> and <i class="calibre4">atole),</i> and cheese. During</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this period you must have no carnal relations. On the morning of the appointed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">day you may breakfast on the fourth part of a tortilla, a little <i class="calibre4">atole,</i> and a bite of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cheese. From then on you fast, eating no lunch or dinner or supper, so that you</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eat the mushrooms on an empty belly, <i class="calibre4">barriga vacia.</i> Then for the four ensuing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">days you are on the same diet. A woman with child must never take the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms, for she is sure to go raving mad for good, but they cause no abortion.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our informants were ready with specific instances where this person or that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had gone mad for breaking the rules. There was that woman in Platanillo,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for example. Being ill, she took the mushrooms, and then, feeling better, she</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ate chicken forthwith, whereupon she went mad. That was around 1947. She</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wandered raving through the Mijeria for a long time, until finally she disap-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peared in the mountains. If a woman with child needs to consult the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">she may take them vicariously, a relative or friend eating them for her.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The reader will observe that the Mije sense no impropriety between the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ancient cult of the divinatory mushroom and the cult of the Christian God.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Mazatlan the pagan and the Christian legacies - the latter a comparatively</p>

  <p class="calibre1">recent innovation - seem fully blended, to a degree remarkable even for Latin</p>

  <p class="calibre1">America. No priest is in residence in Mazatlan and visits by one are rare. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sunday services, well attended, consist of readings by a cantor, while the <i class="calibre4">curan-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">deros,</i> men and women, at the very altar, under the compassionate countenance</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Virgen de la Soledad, treat the sick and infirm and halt with prayers and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ritualistic gestures and the application of eggs to the ailing organs according</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to pagan rites of great antiquity. To all this we ourselves were witnesses.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now we return to the mushroom ceremony. It is night and you hope that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all will be quiet. You have eaten the mushroom caps, swallowing them fast,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one after the other. The stipes he in <i class="calibre4">thejicara</i> on the ground in front of the house-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hold altar, with one <i class="calibre4">vela</i> burning. You and a friend or relative are alone, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">second person to watch over you and listen to you, but he says nothing. If the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms work, they work rather fast, in fifteen minutes or a half hour.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If they don't work, then you make supplication to the stipes, and perhaps light</p>

  <p class="calibre1">three <i class="calibre4">velas</i> instead of one, and perhaps then they will work. When they work,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">you begin to talk and you ask questions of the mushrooms and the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">answer. You go on and on with this dialogue until the cock crows, when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the talking ends. The person who is with you hears everything but never says</p>

  <p class="calibre1">anything. It is good to have a relative or friend with you. The whole performance</p>

  <p class="calibre1">271</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_58"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_29">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">is <i class="calibre4">muy delicado,</i> not to be taken lightly. If someone happens to pass by and per-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ceives what goes on, he withdraws quietly. Afterwards you are faint and weak,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and for a time you cannot walk, but you remember all that was said.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the mushrooms do not work one should look for either of two explana-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tions. Perhaps there was an interruption. Any undue noise, the wailing of a cat,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the braying of an ass, a child bursting in - these things are enough to put the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms off. Or again if the person eating the mushrooms has spoken ill</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of them, or even thought disrespectfully of them, there will be no success.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If he is guilty of this sin, then the mushrooms cause him to see horrible visions of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">snakes, <i class="calibre4">tigres,</i> and such like. But when all is well, then he who eats the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">begins by invoking San Juan, the patron saint of Mazatlan, and then says the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pater Noster, the Credo, and the Confiteor,' and the mushrooms begin to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speak, and they are likely to answer not merely the questions put, but all other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">questions too. Manuel remembers when the prayers were all said in Mije, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">now they are said in Spanish, even by people who know no Spanish. All is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">according to the ordinance of God and the World, says Timoteo. Here again</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the World - <i class="calibre4">na :swin -</i> appears. With good fortune a virtuous man hears music</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and may see heaven. As the evening wears on, the mushrooms themselves</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dictate the program, ordaining such things as the number of <i class="calibre4">velas</i> to be lighted.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Mije the cap of the mushroom is called the 'head' - <i class="calibre4">kobahk</i> in the dialect</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Mazatlan. The top of the cap is the <i class="calibre4">kopk</i> or summit. The stipe is the <i class="calibre4">tek</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">or leg. The edge of the cap is the <i class="calibre4">'ai,</i> 'leaf. It will be recalled that in the case of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4">kong,</i> sometimes only this edge is eaten. The lamella or gill is <i class="calibre4">pa:t.</i> Let the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reader bear in mind that the cap or pileus is called the 'head'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To the south of Mazatlan, ten hours away by foot, lies the Mije village of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Santa Maria Nativitas Coatlan. One of Walter's colleagues, Searle Hoogshagen,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is working there, and we had been in Mazatlan only a few hours before he called</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on us. Moreover, on his bidding two Mije boys of Coatlan came too, Severiano</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sanchez, age 33, and Candido Faustino, age 25. Both of these young men proved</p>

  <p class="calibre1">first rate as informants, speaking Spanish and understanding the purport of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our questions. They described vividly the effect of the mushrooms, how the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eater behaves like a drunken man, and how he carries on both sides of a colloquy,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">posing questions to the mushrooms and then voicing the mushrooms' answers,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for hours on end, in the presence of a relative or friend. They also knew the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pi:tpa,</i> the <i class="calibre4">atka:t,</i> and the <i class="calibre4">kong.</i> Of the former the dosage in Coatlan is signifi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cant-for children, 6 pair; for grown-ups, 9 pair, or if this be not enough, 13</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pair, or at most 18. The dosage jumps thus from 6 to 9 to 13 to 18. According</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to native belief, the World or Universe - <i class="calibre4">na :swin -</i> is served by nine Lesser</p>

  <p class="calibre1">272</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Servants and by thirteen Major Servants. The nine pair and the thirteen pair of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms represent the Lesser and the Major Servants. The word for 'Servant'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is <i class="calibre4">tungmi:tpa.</i> Is it a coincidence that the Mije calendar has eighteen months,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and that the Mije week consists of thirteen days, each with its name? A number</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of other native calendars in Middle America likewise divide the year into eigh-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">teen months and the week into thirteen days. Dr. Borhegyi makes a further</p>

  <p class="calibre1">observation. In the cosmology of the Maya there were nine gods of the Under-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world and thirteen gods of Heaven. Are not these the Lesser Servants and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Major Servants of the World of the Mije? If so, we discover here a significant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cultural correspondence between the Mije and the Maya.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Candido and Severiano told us an extraordinary story of a recent development</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the use of the divinatory mushroom in their town of Coatlan. These boys,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cousins, have an uncle, Feliciano Faustino. In former times only the <i class="calibre4">curanderos</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">knew the secrets of the mushrooms, but this changed in 1943, when their uncle,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Fehciano, took in hand a famous <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> of the neighboring town of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Santa Margarita Huitepec, by name Pe:t Murnt. (Pedro Mundo in Spanish,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Mundo' rendering the Mije word <i class="calibre4">na:swin.)</i> One day at about three in the after-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">noon Don Fehciano with <i class="calibre4">mescal</i> put Pedro Mundo into a state where he disclosed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all the secrets of the mushrooms, and straightway the whole of Coatlan learned</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the story. From that day on the use of the divinatory mushrooms in Coatlan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has become general, everyone invoking the aid of the <i class="calibre4">na :su&gt;in mus</i> when they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are available and needed. Both Don Feliciano and Pedro Mundo are still alive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and they will tell you about all this. (We do not-question the good faith of our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">informants when we suggest that their story is a myth-in-the-making to explain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the secular possession of holy mysteries.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Long before Walter Miller had heard of the mushroom cult or of us, he was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">living in the Mije town of Camotlan, twenty walking hours to the west of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mazatlan.1 There he had put down on paper the folk tales that he heard from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mouths of the Mije, and in the course of that work he came upon tales of strange</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, some with a power to heal, and others divinatory, and others of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kind to drive people mad for good. Here is what he heard:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. Enigmatic but relevant to our theme is the following information supplied by Walter Miller. Just to the east</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Camotlan, in the <i class="calibre4">llano,</i> there is a hill <i class="calibre4">(kopk)</i> that the people call <i class="calibre4">muzut kopk.</i> No one recalls the origin of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">first part of this name, but it could be <i class="calibre4">mus hut,</i> 'mushroom cave'. In this hill there is a cave that the villagers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">call <i class="calibre4">muzut hut.</i> The supposition suggests itself that the hill was called after the 'mushroom cave", and long after-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wards, when the origin of the name had been forgotten, the cave in turn was called after the hill. Deep in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cave the floor is strewn with fragments of ancient pottery and other artifacts, but there are no representations</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of mushrooms. A local informant has told Mr. Miller that on the top of the hill can be seen a stone shaped to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">resemble a gigantic spindle whorl, <i class="calibre4">malacate.</i></p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_30">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Of mushrooms there are various kinds. One kind has been used as a medicine, says</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jose Trinidad. His own nephew, Alefonsa, had been ill for five years with an unnamed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">illness. He could not walk but moved around on a stool. He would sit in the patio and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">slide the stool from place to place. Then they gave him a kind of mushroom to eat, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he was cured and began to walk as before.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jose says there is another kind of mushroom about which there is a belief that it will</p>

  <p class="calibre1">induce a dream, a particular kind of dream, one in which two <i class="calibre4">duendes</i> or spirits appear</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the eater, one male and the other female. They talk with him, and he asks questions and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they answer. They will tell you where lost things may be found, and name the thief who</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has stolen something and say where the stolen thing is. When you plan a trip, they will</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tell you what luck you will have on the journey. Cerilo of Santa Margarita Huitepec</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has eaten these mushrooms several times. The first time they didn't give the result. Cerilo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has a son named Delfino. When he was about to eat the mushrooms, he was afraid and so</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he had Delfino watch over him. When he had eaten them, sure enough the spirits</p>

  <p class="calibre1">appeared. He talked with them and asked about the trip he was going to make, for he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had five burros and was about to set out for the Isthmus with Delfino. The spirits told</p>

  <p class="calibre1">him not to go for the burros would all die. They talked about different things. Then</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the spirits said, 'We must go, for the cock is crowing.' The spirits disappeared and Cerilo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">awoke. Straightway he asked his son if the cock had crowed and was told that it had.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But he didn't believe the spirits and went on his trip anyway. Just as the spirits had said,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all five of his burros died on that trip.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Another who used these mushrooms was a woman of Camotlan named Rosa. She was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a family from Zacatepec who had moved to Camotlan to live. Later she lived with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">her own father as his woman. He finally died in Huitepec. So Rosa ate the mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and began to tell the people that the world was coming to an end. And she began to say</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that she was the mother of the Virgin. She was really deceiving the people very much.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Many folk went to her place daily and there they were all day, waning and weeping</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about their sins. Then some of the younger ones who had been to school talked to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the town authorities and got them to threaten to jail her if she didn't stop it. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">authorities told her they'd run her out of town if she ate any more of those mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Why, people were taking offerings to her and getting her to pray for them. That was in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1945. She stopped it then, but some say she seemed to go crazy and wandered around in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the woods. She died several years later.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here end, for the present, our notes on the role of mushrooms in the Mije</p>

  <p class="calibre1">culture. On Monday, June i, we set out on our return journey, and Allan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Richardson and RGW reached New York on June 5.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vv e have now brought to a close our account of the divinatory mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cult in Mexico, insofar as it is known to exist today and is recorded in the annals.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here we would stop, were it not for evidence of an order different from anything</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so far mentioned, evidence that, if relevant, vastly extends the former range of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Middle American mushroom cult both in time and space. If this enigmatic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence really relates to mushrooms, as we believe it does, a cult of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sacred mushroom goes back among the highland Maya of Guatemala at least</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to B.C. 1000, and in that area persisted for close to 2,000 years, until the archeo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logical evidence fades out in what is known as the late classic period, around</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A.D. 900.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On September 9, 1952, Dr. Hans Mardersteig of Verona wrote us that he had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">observed in the new Rietberg Museum of Zurich a curious stone statuette,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about one foot high, representing a mushroom with a human face carved in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">high relief on the stipe. The Museum attributed this artifact to Middle America</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but seemed to know no more. It had come to the Museum as one of many</p>

  <p class="calibre1">items in the collection of a private donor. With this letter and this artifact</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our inquiries into Middle American ethno-mycology began. We reproduce</p>

  <p class="calibre1">photographs of the remarkable Rietberg mushroom stone.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By almost the same post Robert Graves sent us a cutting from a pharmaceu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tical publication1 referring to the i6th century use of an inebriating mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among the Indians of Mexico. This was our first intimation of a mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cult in Mexico. At once we embarked on a double-barreled inquiry, pursuing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the one hand the secret of the mushroom stone and on the other hand the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cult of the mushroom in Mexico.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From Dr. Gordon Ekholm of the American Museum of Natural History</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we quickly learned that the Rietberg artifact was one of many 'mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stones' known to Middle American archeologists, almost all of them discovered</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the highlands of Guatemala, most of them in that part of the highlands now</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inhabited by the Quiche Indians, but a few apparently found to the east across</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the border in Salvador and to the west in the Ocosingo region of Chiapas,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Mexican state adjoining Guatemala. We quickly made another discovery.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In scanning the references to the mushroom stones in specialized publications,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we came upon a reproduction of our Zurich artifact in <i class="calibre4">Globus,</i> a learned perio-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dical published in Brunswick, with commentary by the geographer and ethno-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logist Carl Sapper. The notice appeared in 1898, and it turned out that this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Rietberg specimen, unbeknownst to the Rietberg Museum itself, was the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">earliest mushroom stone to have drawn the attention of the learned world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In its excellent state of preservation and the bold simplicity of its lines, it remains</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to this day one of the most striking examples of its kind.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Sapper described the artifact as mushroom-shaped but he did not suggest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the carving might really represent a mushroom. From Dr. Sapper's day</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to now all archeologists know these artifacts as 'mushroom stones', but not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">,one has ever come to grips with the possibility that they represent what</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they look like. Indeed it is customary to set off the designation in inverted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">commas and the learned writers often add a safety clause expressly saying</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that of course the designation is only one of convenience. Have we not here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">yet another example of the subconscious rejection of mushrooms by scholars</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the mycophobic West; The pattern is too consistent to be accidental. Gitlow</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shows no curiosity about the mysterious inebriating mushroom in New Guinea.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Prescott in his <i class="calibre4">Conquest of Mexico,</i> exercising his editorial discretion, chooses to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pass over in silence the inebriating mushrooms of the Nahua. Safford denies</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their very existence witli^ vehemence suggestive of a violent gastrocolic upset.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Beals overlooks the mushrooms in the Mije culture. The archeologists fail to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">see mushrooms in the 'mushroom stones'. But, after all, are not these the pheno-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mena that we should expect? The anthropological traits of the anthropologists</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(which of course they ignore) poise them in a precarious relativity vis-a-vis the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cultures that they observe with a god-like superiority, and introduce into their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">findings a big coefficient of defective perception.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As we progressed in our inquiries we made a further discovery. None of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">archeologists who had contemplated the mushroom stones had ever heard of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mushroom cult of the Indians in Mexico. Conversely, none of the anthropo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logists of Mexico who knew about the divinatory mushroom had ever paid</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attention to the mushroom stones of Guatemalan provenience. Apparently we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were the first to suggest (be it noted: we do not <i class="calibre4">assert)</i> that the 'mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stones' were actually stone effigies of mushrooms, that there had been at one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">time a cult of the mushroom in the highlands of Guatemala, and finally that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">possibility should be considered of a kinship between such a cult and the surviv-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing divinatory rite of the inebriating mushrooms in Mexico.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">No sooner had we raised the question of the mushroom stones with Dr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ekholm late in 1952, than he informed us that a brilliant young anthropologist</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and archeologist of Hungarian origin, Dr. Stephan F. Borhegyi, was at that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">moment engaged on the first comprehensive and intensive study of all the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room stones known to exist. He was in Guatemala City on a Bollingen Foundation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grant, engaged primarily in a reorganization of the collections of the Museo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nacional. We communicated at once with him, contributing our mushroomic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggestions, and thus there began a collaboration that for us was most fruitful</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and exciting. After our visit to Huautla in August 1953, we motored down</p>

  <p class="calibre1">through the valley of Oaxaca to Tehuautepec and the famous Isthmus. There,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">three weeks we devoted ourselves with Dr. and Mrs. Borhegyi to an intensive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ethno-mycological inquiry among the Indians of the Guatemalan highlands,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to discover whether there was any surviving trace of a mushroom cult.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Borhegyi had already brought close to completion his minute examination</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of all the known mushroom stones, totalling more than a hundred. Additional</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Fig- 17</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">ones are certain to be discovered as time goes on. They are an extraordinary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cultural expression for several reasons. The earliest seem to go back to the period</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known to Maya students as the early pre-classic or developmental era, in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">second millennium B.C. In general the early ones for the layman are the most</p>

  <p class="calibre1">striking: they are beautifully carved and the figure jutting out from the stipe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is often gripping in the vitality of the facial expression. We reproduce one of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the best of these, from the collection of Mr. Hans Namuth of New York.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This one is late pre-classic, that is, dating from the long stretch of years from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">B.C. 500 to A.D. 200. The Rietberg specimen appears to be also from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same period. Instead of a human figure, the carved effigy is often of an animal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and full face. The face itself is anthropomorphic, but the four toes are the sure</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stigma of the amphibian. Dr. Borhegyi considers this specimen pre-classic.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The mushroom-stones become scarce or perhaps even absent in the early classic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they re-appear, this time crudely carved, often with no effigy on the stipe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then they vanish for good, and for about the half millennium that preceded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Conquest there is no trace of them, nor do they reappear in human circula-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion until the end of the ipth century with the publication of Dr. Sapper's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">observations. That the later mushroom stones should be the crudest is hardly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">surprising: a cult in its pristine vigor expresses itself most freshly.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Borhegyi has generously made available to us his chart of the mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stones, typing them by chronological and geographical provenience, and we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reproduce it here for the first time folded in the pocket at the end of our book.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Maya still live in the Yucatan peninsula, Chiapas, Tabasco, and Guate-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the low-lying Peten and the Highlands, belong to the Maya family. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Highlands there are several linguistic families, but three of the languages form</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. This is the native name of the coatimundi (nasua narica), of the same family as the raccoon, a family distin-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">guished anatomically by the fact that the males possess a phallic bone. The <i class="calibre4">pisote</i> was associated with phallic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">matters by the Maya, but no phallus is present in any mushroom stone so far discovered. In Mexico the <i class="calibre4">pisote</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, collect vocabulary, and finally begin to discuss the inebriating vir-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tue of certain kinds. Our informants were invariably surprised to learn that such</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms existed, and showed themselves most curious and even envious as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we described the divinatory mushrooms of the Mazatecs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though of direct evidence we found none, our inquiries were not fruitless.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the linguistic field we made what may be a pregnant discovery, possibly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sensational but in the present state of our knowledge tantalizing. It relates</p>

  <p class="calibre1">exclusively to the Quiche Indians: the linguistic usage of which we are about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to speak and for which we obtained multiple confirmation is unknown in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the other places that we visited. Indeed, it seems to be unfamiliar to leading</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Quiche specialists. In every area that we visited the same word with dialectal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">variants was used for mushroom: <i class="calibre4">ocox,</i> V being pronounced like the English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'sh'. In the Quiche area this word also means the external genital organs of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">woman. We learned this first in San Pedro Jocopilas and verified it later in other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Quiche-speaking communities. Our first informant, Epilonio Giron, after our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">women folk withdrew on his suggestion, told us of this other meaning of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Quiche word for mushroom, and then added that everyone knew this second</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sense, but that one should never use it. In short, it is tabu. In Momostenango</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Suzanne Borhegyi and Masha, off on their own, accompanied by a young</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indian woman as interpreter, broached the subject with a flock of Indian women</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there, whom they discovered washing clothes in the rushing stream. Their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inquiries evoked peals of merry laughter, but no elucidation whatever. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">women refused to develop the subject, and who shall blame them?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In our Mazatec inquiries we had uncovered a curious linguistic usage</p>

  <p class="calibre1">concerning mushrooms. The reader will recall that there is no single Mazatec</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word that embraces all the mushrooms. There are two, one for all kinds save</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the divinatory species, and another general term for the various species held</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in honor as vehicles of divine inspiration. The Indians of Guatemala are not so</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophagic as the Mexicans, but in the market places there mushrooms of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">various kinds are on sale, and we were startled to discover in Guatemala city</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the Spanish word <i class="calibre4">hongo</i> covers all species except one. That one is the fav-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">orite for the table and its common name is <i class="calibre4">anacate.</i> In all likelihood <i class="calibre4">anacate</i> is an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eroded form of the Nahuatl <i class="calibre4">nandcatl.</i> Whether the borrowing took place before</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or after the Conquest, we do not know, but already when the Spaniards arrived</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Nahuatl influences in the Maya area were powerful. This verbal fission,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dividing the mushroom world into two without an overriding collective term,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is a curious thing, especially as it recurs in two places as far removed from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">each other as Huautla and Guatemala City. We took pains to identify the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">280</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">anacate</i> of Guatemala, eating it in quantity and in San Juan Sacatepequez going</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out after them in the woods with our interpreter Bravlio. We found them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">exactly where the market women of Guatemala City had said we should,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among the <i class="calibre4">encinos blancos,</i> 'white oaks', which turned out to be the oak known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to botanists as the quercus fulva. The mushroom could be taken either for a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">large cantharellus or for a craterellus, and it is in fact the craterellus cantharellus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Fr. ex Schw. It is a chanterelle without lamellae.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Borhegyi later combed the Quiche and Kakchiquel chronicles and legends</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for references to mushrooms. There come down to us from early times two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">native narratives of the Highland Maya, one in Quiche and the other in Kakchi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quel, the <i class="calibre4">Popol Vuh</i> and the <i class="calibre4">Annals of the Kakchiqnels.</i> Written in the native lan-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">guages, they have been translated into Spanish and English. Dr. Borhegyi dis-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">covered in each of them one reference to mushrooms, and in each case mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms are associated with religious observances. These texts were certainly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">composed after the era we assign to the mushroom stones, but they give us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">documentary evidence that mushrooms played a role in the religious life of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Highland Maya. (We realize that the ancestors of the Quiche and Kakchiquel peo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ples are supposed to have arrived in their present location as conquerors around</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the 12th century, but whoever the conquerors may have been, it is probable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the indigenous culture absorbed them.) Here is the passage in the <i class="calibre4">Popol Vuh,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">as presented in the English text by Delia Goetz and Sylvanus Griswold Morley:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And when they found the young of the birds and the deer, they went at once to place</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the blood of the deer and of the birds in the mouth of the stones, that were Tohil and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Avilix. As soon as the blood had been drunk by the gods, the stones spoke, when the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">priests and the sacrificers came, when they came to bring their offerings. And they did the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same before their symbols, burning <i class="calibre4">pericon</i> and <i class="calibre4">holom ocox.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">[University of Oklahoma Press, 1950, p. 192]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We do not know what <i class="calibre4">pericon</i> was.2 'Tohil' was the Quiche variant of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Toltec Quetzalcoatl, the 'feathered serpent', but we know not how the god</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Avilix looked. <i class="calibre4">Holom ocox</i> means 'mushroom head'. In San Martin Jilotepeque</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our informant Alberto Calan had told us of an unwholesome mushroom known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to him as the <i class="calibre4">holom ixpek,</i> 'toad's head', a name doubly interesting for us because</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it links the mushroom with the toad and because of the fungal use of the word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for 'head', reminding us of the passage in <i class="calibre4">Popol Vuh.3</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. Our specimens of the <i class="calibre4">anacates</i> were the subject of a note by Professor Roger Heim that appeared in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Revue de Mycologie,</i> April 1954, Tome xix, Fasc. i, pp. 53fF.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. If it is the plant known commonly in Mexico today by the same name, it is the tagetes lucida Cav.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3. The Quiche word for 'toad', <i class="calibre4">ixpek,</i> is startling because of its superficial resemblance to the Indo-European</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The passage in the <i class="calibre4">Annals of the Kakchiquels</i> as translated from the original</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by Adrian Recinos and into English by Delia Goetz reads thus:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At that time, too, they began to worship the devil. Each seven days, each thirteen days,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they offered him sacrifices, placing before him fresh resin [i.e., <i class="calibre4">copal],</i> green branches, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fresh bark of the trees [i.e., <i class="calibre4">amate?],</i> and burning before him a small cat, image of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">night. They took to him also the mushrooms of the trees, and drew blood from their ears.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Again the words in the original tongue are <i class="calibre4">holom ocox,</i> 'mushroom heads', and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they are described as 'of the trees'.1 We had learned in Huautla that one of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">four kinds of sacred inebriating mushrooms grows hi trees, and Juan de Cordoba</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in his Zapotec lexicon calls it the <i class="calibre4">nocuana peneeche.</i> Here then hi the Kakchiquel</p>

  <p class="calibre1">root discussed on pp. 92 ff. We found several variants — <i class="calibre4">xepek, ixpuk, xpuk</i> —• in the towns we visited. In all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cases V has the phonetic value of English 'sh'. The word carries other meanings, such as 'cave' in Quetzal-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tenango. In Chichicastenango we found that a similar word relates either to the vagina or the womb. We are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">told that in the Zapotec dialect spoken at Mitla <i class="calibre4">xkep</i> means 'womb'. We had neither time nor competence to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">explore the suggestion here of a cultural association linking toads to fertility such as we find in Europe. I. In the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Recinos-Goetz translation, University of Oklahoma Press, 1953, pp. 82-83, the passage is rendered thus:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">. . . the mushrooms (which grow at the foot) of the trees . . .</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The interpolated words are obviously superfluous, the translators presumably not knowing that many mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grow in trees. This reference to tree fungi reminds us of a curious passage in the <i class="calibre4">Relation de las Minas de</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Temazcaltepec,</i> where Caspar de Covarrubias enumerates briefly the kinds of food that the people eat, and in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Troncoso, Madrid, 1905, vol. vn, p. 31.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">relio Carreras, spoke of a divinatory species growing on wood. It seems probable that arboreal fungi play a distinct</p>

  <p class="calibre1">role in Middle-American fungal lore, one that remains to be explored.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">text, which was put down on paper after the Conquest under Spanish influences</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but which recalls pre-Conquest events, we read of a religious rite in which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">arboreal mushrooms were used.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Both the Quiche and the Kakchiquel narratives use the same expression -</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">holom ocox.</i> Obviously this should be translated as 'mushroom caps', and we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">know from our Mije notes that the cap in Mije is a 'head'. We find the same</p>

  <p class="calibre1">metaphor in Mazatec, where the cap of the mushroom is the <i class="calibre4">hko4,</i> meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'head'. Perhaps the reader has hit on the further observation that we now make.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Mije and Mazatecs in their mushroom cult lay stress on the separation of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pileus from stipe, and the virtue lies primarily in the pileus. They are still follow-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing the practice recorded for us by the ancient Quiche and Kakchiquel narrators,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">still decapitating their ceremonial mushroom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As we thumb through the pages of Sahagun's immense work, in the Florentine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Codex, we discover yet another miniature relevant to our argument. Executed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by an Indian under Spanish influence, it is pregnant with mushroomic meaning.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the left we discover an Indian drinking from a Spanish goblet. On the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">right are two mushroom caps, 'heads', the Quiche <i class="calibre4">holom ocox,</i> the Mije <i class="calibre4">kobahk,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Mazatec <i class="calibre4">hko4.</i> There are a pair of these caps, i.e., the Mije <i class="calibre4">casada.</i> A decapi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tated stipe stands on one side. Thus in this picture we come upon themes familiar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to us from present-day usages among the Mije and Mazatecs and in the pre-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Conquest annals of the Quiche and Kakchiquel peoples. We have found in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sahagun's text no passage that this miniature illustrates. What does it mean?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We venture a rash but tempting guess. There must have been a moment in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the social history of i6th century Mexico when the fire-water of the Spaniards</p>

  <p class="calibre1">confronted the inebriating mushrooms of traditional use with a challenge deeply</p>

  <p class="calibre1">disturbing to the emotions of the conservative Indians. Does not this miniature</p>

  <p class="calibre1">illustrate that moment of challenge ? The mushroom caps are disproportionately</p>

  <p class="calibre1">big: this is the artist's device for showing their subjective importance, just as in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the earlier miniature, on page 235, Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Underworld,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hovers with giant stature over the Indian who is eating his pair of <i class="calibre4">teo-nandcatl.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the indigenous cultures of Middle America one of the crucial problems for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">anthropologists is the interplay, over thousands of years, between hieratic cul-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tures on the one hand, rising and falling spasmodically and sporadically and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">often leaving behind spectacular monuments, and on the other hand, the folk</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cultures of the farming population, simple, relatively homogeneous, and singu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">larly tough in resisting outside influences.1 Humble artifacts such as incense</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. For an illuminating discussion of this problem see Stephan F. Borhegyi's 'Cultura Folk y Cultura Compleja</p>

  <p class="calibre1">burners, figurines, and clay effigies fashioned so as to serve also as whistles have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been made in virtually the same styles for three thousand years and are still</p>

  <p class="calibre1">being sold at the present hour in the native market places. The mushroom stones</p>

  <p class="calibre1">do not belong to this folk culture. If they are a clue to a mushroom cult, we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must suppose that the cult was hieratic, the attribute of a priestly elite, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that that cult passed away with that elite. The highest achievements of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mayan culture, which are known to have been hieratic, belonged to the lowland</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Maya of the Peten and Yucatan, where no mushroom stones have been found.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">However, there could also have been priest-governed societies in the Highlands,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in fact in the Highland excavations at Kaminaljuyu, near Guatemala City,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there has been found in a pre-Classic tomb that was probably sacerdotal one of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the effigy mushroom stones, representing a jaguar.2 We suggest that there was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">once a mushroom cult in the Highlands in the formal, organized sense, a liturgy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">administered by priests on set occasions, perhaps for the laity to join in. How</p>

  <p class="calibre1">different such a cult would be from the intimate, family use of the divinatory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms that we have witnessed among the Mazatecs and Mije, where the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms are consulted, when available, if needed, in the dead of night, with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">only two or three gathered together! But there is no necessary contradiction</p>

  <p class="calibre1">here. Our i6th century writers tell us of the large gatherings where the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms were consumed in public. And what could have been more inviting to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">priestly elite than to take over from the folk culture their divinatory mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and clothe the deeply stirring faith of the people in those divine mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the ceremonial habiliments that an elaborate ritual would have required?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As we review our evidence, we discern an endemic use of inebriating mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from earliest times in the enduring folk culture of Middle America, not in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">low, hot country, but throughout the higher country, over an area extending</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the Valley of Mexico into Guatemala and Salvador. We see this endemic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">folk usage seized upon, taken over, lifted up, and reverently exploited by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sophisticated priestly elite in certain hieratic phases of the upland cultures.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Certainly we have not discovered the tie that would unequivocally bind the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom stones of Guatemala and Chiapas with today's intimate folk cult. That</p>

  <p class="calibre1">en el Area Maya Meridional", <i class="calibre4">Ciendas Saddles,</i> published by the Pan-American Union, Washington, D. C.,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vol. v, No. 26, April 1954.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. Is it coincidence that, just as the mushroom stones are found only at a certain altitude and never in the hot,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">low country, so according to our informants in Huautla and Mazatlan, the use of the divinatory mushroom is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unknown among the Mazatecs and Mije living today in the <i class="calibre4">ticrra caliente?</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">2.</i> For further illustrations and discussion of this remarkable specimen, one of the oldest known, see Publ.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SACRED MUSHROOMS OF THE NAHUA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">such a link will be discovered is unlikely but not impossible. Perhaps on some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">holy hill or <i class="calibre4">ce.no,</i> or deep in the recesses of some cave, in a remote corner of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Oaxaca or Chiapas, the Indians still direct their humble supplications to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stone image of a mushroom, unbeknownst to circumambulating ethnolo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gists. Unless someone discovers such a survival, how can we hope to establish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a connection between the ancient stone carvings and the divinatory mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms ;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yet the evidence that we have assembled points toward such a connection.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We know that the Indians of Middle America are mycophiles with extensive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">knowledge of mushroomic properties and corresponding vocabularies. In their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cultures mushrooms have always been emphasized, not ignored. Among these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indians religious associations have always interpenetrated every aspect of human</p>

  <p class="calibre1">existence, and it would be rash to assume that this fusion of daily life with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">religious beliefs excluded the fungal world at the time when the mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stones were carved. We know furthermore what a profound hold the ceremonial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms have to this day on certain of the remoter Indian tribes, and the range</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of this cult doubtless runs beyond the limits that we have had opportunity to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">explore. In the case of the Mije, their country overlaps the area where the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">later mushroom stones seem to have been found. We know from surviving</p>

  <p class="calibre1">annals that before the Conquest ceremonial mushrooms were used in religious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">observances in the Guatemalan Highlands, where most of the earlier stones have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been found. A divinatory mushroom grips the imagination, and it would justify</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the functional use, in religious ceremonies, of the mushroom stones. The presence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a divinatory mushroom is rare in human cultures: would it not be extraor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dinary to find a mushroom cult in the same area with the mushroom carvings -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">themselves unique - and yet unrelated to them? Whereas in the past no one was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggesting a mushroomic explanation for the mushroom stones, we think that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the presumption favors such an explanation now, and that the burden of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">argument must he on those who oppose it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Meanwhile many exciting questions remain unanswered and cry for the further</p>

  <p class="calibre1">field work that we cannot undertake. We have not fully identified the divinatory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms that the Mazatecs and Mije use, to say nothing of other peoples</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where the cult may survive. They must be securely identified, with multiple</p>

  <p class="calibre1">corroboration. Their specific properties as understood by the Indians must be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fully set down. Then they must be proved empirically, under controlled con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ditions. The Mije have developed sweeping explanations for any failures in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use of their divinatory mushrooms: this suggests that auto-suggestion plays</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a role, or that sometimes the wrong mushroom is taken, or that the virtue</p>

  <p class="calibre1">varies under differing circumstances. The difficult task of chemical analysis,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the isolation of the active agents, will be the final achievement.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Mije are related linguistically to the Zoques, their neighbors to the east</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Chiapas. What do the Zoques know of the divinatory mushrooms&gt; If they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use them, perhaps we shall discover, after all, that the Maya peoples immediately</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the east of them also share the cult, or remember having practiced it in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">past.1 Robert Weitlaner knows the Chinantecs as well as any other living</p>

  <p class="calibre1">anthropologist. Among them he has failed to find any trace of the divinatory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom, though they live between the Mazatecs and the Mije. How strange</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this is! But it only points up the importance for all workers among the Indians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Middle America, both linguists and anthropologists, to include the divinatory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms in their inquiries, and to report their findings whether negative</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or positive. Where the cult does not survive, memories of it may, and where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">no memories exist, perhaps in the names for mushrooms the linguists may trace</p>

  <p class="calibre1">forgotten knowledge. Slowly we should begin to pinpoint the results of such</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inquiries on a cultural map of Mexico keyed to the mycological lore of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indians. But the search for evidence should not be limited to our contemporary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world. The whole corpus of surviving pre-Conquest artistic expression in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">highland areas of Middle America should also be reviewed, on the chance that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">divine mushrooms figuring therein have hitherto escaped detection. Later we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shall venture some suggestions of our own in this archeological field.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. There are grounds for Unking together the Maya and the Mije-Zoque cultures, the two linguistic groups</p>

  <p class="calibre1">being perhaps descended from a common parent stock. See J. Alden Mason's paper on Middle American</p>

  <p class="calibre1">linguistic groupings in&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">The Maya and Their Neighbors,</i>&nbsp;D. Appleton-Century, N. Y., 1940 (a Festschrift in</p>
