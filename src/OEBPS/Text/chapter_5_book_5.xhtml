            <p><span class="initial">M</span>ore names are reported in English for the puffball than for any other kind of mushroom. There is the fanciful &#8216;devil&#8217;s snuffbox&#8217;, which recalls the corresponding <i>chortova perechnitza</i> or &#8216;devil&#8217;s pepperpot&#8217; of the Russians. There is &#8216;frogcheese&#8217;, designating the young puffball before it dries up. There is that curious word &#8216;bunt&#8217;, now dying out. In the Oxford Dictionary it follows hard on another word, identically spelled, that is defined as &#8216;a swelling, a pouch- or bag-shaped part of a net, sail, etc.&#8217;, and both words are put down as of unknown etymology. Surely, from the swelling growth of the puffball and the many associations of the fungi with the idea of pouches and bags and swellings, we may regard these words as one.</p>

            <p>However, in England and throughout western Europe the distinctive association of the puffball is scabrous. &#8216;Puckfist&#8217; is the English archetype, whence depend a number of variants: puff-fist, bullfist, fistball, fuzzball, pixie-puff, and finally the cleansed and devitalized survivor of the lot, our puffball, of which the bad-smelling origin is lost almost from memory. In human speech as in the physical world there operates a law of entropy that saps the strength from once virile metaphors, until only bookworms (ourselves perhaps devitalized!) detect and relish with rarefied connoisseurship the faded flavors that have lain stale for centuries. &#8216;Feist&#8217; was the word once commonly used for the silent flatus; it and the noisy &#8216;fart&#8217; are simply different phases or &#8216;grades&#8217; of the same word, etymologically identical. (&#8217;Feist&#8217; rimes with &#8216;enticed&#8217;, but in &#8216;puckfist&#8217; the V is short.) They correspond respectively to the French <i>vesse</i> and <i>pet.</i> Just as the Latin <i>p</i> of <i>pater</i> corresponds to the &#8216;f&#8217; of &#8216;father&#8217;, so the <i>p</i> of the French verb <i>péter</i> in ah1 likelihood corresponds to the &#8216;f&#8217; of our English words. One of the famous creations of the French pastry-cook is the <i>pet de nonne</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b5-fn1" id="cp5b5-r1">[1]</a></sup>: here in this single term, as in a capsule, the spirit of Gallic humor was caught, though today it trips off the tongue of Frenchmen with no thought of its pristine flavor. A French wine that is <i>pétillant</i> is one that fizzes slightly, and originally &#8216;to fizz&#8217; was the English verb that corresponded in scabrous meaning to the noun &#8216;feist&#8217;. In the beginning the <i>pétard</i> was an enormous <i>pet</i>, and he who is hoist by his own petard is the victim of a peculiarly personal rocket action such as Hieronymus Bosch actually depicted in his <i>Last Judgment.</i></p>

            <p>The metaphor of the silent flatus appears to have attached itself to the puffball in earliest times, before the linguistic break-up of the Indo-European peoples. For the English, as we have seen, the puffball used to be the puckfist or imp&#8217;s silent flatus. In French it is the <i>vesse de loup,</i> or wolf&#8217;s silent flatus, and similarly in Dutch, <i>wolfsveest</i>; and in Danish the sources give the corresponding <i>ulve-fiis,</i> but this is not a drawing-room word. Some Frisian islanders speak of the toad&#8217;s flatus, but the more common Frisian term is <i>ûlefyst,</i> or owl&#8217;s flatus, which may be traceable to an erroneous popular rendering of the Danish term. In Russia the genteel name for the puffball is the devil&#8217;s pepperpot, as we have seen; but there circulates an earthier term, <i>bzdjukha</i>, the silent flatus. The Basques speak of the ass&#8217;s flatus, <i>astaputz</i>; and in Romansch we find in the Engadine, wolf&#8217;s flatus, <i>toffas d&#8217;luj,</i> and in the Surselva, <i>cacs tgapper,</i> or crow&#8217;s droppings. The mushroom manuals report <i>cuesco de lobo,</i> wolf&#8217;s flatus, for the Spaniards, and we ourselves report <i>pedo de lobo</i> in use in the Castilian countryside. The standard name in Italian is <i>vescia di lupo</i>, but in the Trentino dialect we have <i>slofa</i>, which is a low word for the <i>membrum virile</i>. In Catalonia we find <i>pet de llop</i> and <i>pet de bou</i>, wolf&#8217;s flatus and ox-flatus, this latter paralleling the English bullfist. By far the most interesting of all, however, are two other Catalan terms: <i>bufa del diable</i> and <i>bufa del dimoni</i>. <i>Bufa</i> like &#8216;feist&#8217; is a silent flatus, and so in both these Catalan expressions we find exact equivalents of the obsolete English puckfist. But the ramifying interplay of semantic and phonetic associations does not stop there, for in the Catalan language <i>bufa</i> also means &#8216;bladder&#8217; and a cluster of kindred things, and this transports us at once to the maze of meanings that we found clinging to the Irish <i>púca</i>, the Latin <i>bulga</i> and its derivatives, and indeed the whole cluster of <i>pogge</i> words. In Irish, according to a reliable source, the puffball is <i>cos-a-phouka</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b5-fn2" id="cp5b5-r2">[2]</a></sup>, &#8216;Puck&#8217;s foot&#8217;, which reminds us of the Old French word, <i>le bot,</i> meaning both Satan and &#8216;toad&#8217;.</p>

            <p>In the puffball vocabulary we discover a subtle interplay of sounds and meanings, where strict etymologies are lost in a common pool. The idea of the devil underlies all-in pixie and puck and the <i>diable</i> and <i>dimoni</i> of the Catalans; and, as it were behind a mask, the Evil One is hidden in toad and wolf, those creatures steeped in terrible folk associations. The owl of the Frisians is an evasive substitute for the wolf, and the crow of the Surselva may hide, through translation and metamorphosis, the German <i>Kröte</i> or the French <i>crapaud</i>. In addition to the devil, the scabrous exhalation of gas is everywhere &#8212;&#8203; in feist, fuzz (i.e., fizz), puff, <i>vesse</i>, <i>pet</i>, <i>bufa</i>, and behind the euphemistic face of the bull and <i>bou</i>, and probably behind the enigmatic <i>Bo-</i> of <i>Bovist</i>. &#8216;Ball&#8217; in &#8216;puffball&#8217; is a happy dilution of the same theme, an acceptable alliterative substitute. In &#8216;puff&#8217; there is the phonetic overlap with &#8216;puck&#8217; and the semantic overlap with &#8216;feist&#8217;. Like those modern clutches in automobiles that move imperceptibly from speed to speed, the peoples of western Europe, when they speak of the lycoperdon, slip from sound to sound and metaphor to metaphor, under pressures of primitive tabu and the modern sense of propriety. On this phenomenon suggestive of punning the scholars bestow the name of paronomasia. There is in our case a pool of sounds and a pool of meanings and a pool of evasive substitutes, mingling together in step with the pulsation of underlying ideas and emotions. Our own inquiry is keyed to the association of fungi with toads, and here there remains one notable observation to add. So far as we know, <i>bufa</i> has never designated the toad in Catalonia. But phonetically and semantically (because of the toad&#8217;s aptitude for prodigious inhalation of air and exhalation), the Latin <i>bufo</i>, meaning toad, and the Catalan <i>bufa</i> are close kin, and etymologically, though neither is derived from the other, they must both spring genetically from the same verbal tree. Thus there is a further strange analogy between &#8216;puckfist&#8217; and <i>bufa del dimoni:</i> &#8216;puck&#8217; and <i>bufa</i> mean &#8216;imp&#8217; and &#8216;feist&#8217; respectively, but in addition each is pregnant, so to speak, with the latent idea of &#8216;toad&#8217;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b5-fn3" id="cp5b5-r3">[3]</a></sup></p>

            <p>Our survey of the puckfist names has been confined to the Indo-European peoples and Basques, and chiefly to Europe. Think of the horizons for research that open up when we ask ourselves what metaphors are used for the puckfist elsewhere in the Eurasian land-mass, and then in the other continents. What a field for scholarly enterprise is here, and how learned and mad must that inspired scholar be, after the manner of a Norman Douglas character, who will devote himself to this pursuit, his journeyirigs and questionings to be financed of course by some noble Foundation with a nose for the more subtile cultural aromas!</p>

            <p>Throughout the puff ball world there is present one element that we did not find in the <i>pogge</i> words, and this new element is the scatological. The puffballs, which in their &#8216;frogcheese&#8217; phase make good eating, despite this virtue are linked throughout western Europe with the filth of hindwind. And this leads us into a fresh area for exploration. The High German word for &#8216;toad&#8217; is <i>Kröte</i>, of which the etymology has defied the efforts of massive German scholarship. We dare not aspire to trace this word to its lair, but as a fresh approach to a vexed problem, we submit that German <i>Krote</i> is the same as the Rhineland word <i>krotz,</i> meaning originally the dung of domesticated animals; i.e., dung with value for the farmer. The same word appears in Flemish <i>krotte</i>, and it turns up also in the familiar French <i>crotte</i> and <i>crottin</i>, whose primary meaning was also &#8216;dung&#8217;. Indeed, if this surmise be well received, we venture further. The French word for &#8216;toad&#8217;, <i>crapaud,</i> is certainly not related etymologically to any root meaning dung, being akin to the Provençal word <i>grapal</i>, but the precise shape that this word has taken in modern French seems to be traceable to popular pressures that seek to associate the loathsome creature and its name with <i>crape</i>, a French word whose scatological English counterpart is known wherever the English language is spoken. The Oxford Dictionary offers us a Scottish and English dialectical word for the dung of domesticated animals, &#8216;tath&#8217; or &#8216;tathe&#8217;, which in Norwegian and Swedish dialects becomes <i>tad.</i> Do we not here find the identical semantic transfer? Perhaps we are in the presence of three doublets, the Germans referring to the toad as &#8216;dung&#8217;, the English and Scandinavians doing likewise, and the French word for toad being re-shaped to resemble <i>crape.</i> In the Danish pattern of fungal metaphors, we find that dung is an alternative to the toad in a pair of fungal words &#8212;&#8203; <i>paddehat,</i> &#8216;toad&#8217;s hat&#8217;, and <i>skarnhat,</i> &#8216;dung hat&#8217;. How felicitous for our argument is the word &#8216;cowpad&#8217;, wherein the second element here means &#8216;dung&#8217;, but elsewhere as we know means &#8216;toad&#8217;!<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b5-fn4" id="cp5b5-r4">[4]</a></sup> On an earlier page we considered the possibility that &#8216;toad&#8217;, a word of unknown origin, might be descended from a Celtic adaptation of the Latin word for &#8216;poison&#8217;, and certainly in Anglo-Saxon times the loathed creature was linked with venom. But on balance the Nordic <i>tad</i>, meaning &#8216;dung&#8217;, seems to us the likelier source.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b5-fn5" id="cp5b5-r5">[5]</a></sup></p>

            <p>In modern English no filthier word for the fungi exists than &#8216;smut&#8217;, the name of the fungal parasite that afflicts corn. It is cousin to the German word <i>Schtmttz,</i> &#8216;dirt&#8217;, and its evil potency comes out in its figurative use for condemning scabrous language. To the Englishman the two meanings of &#8216;smut&#8217; seem so fittingly wedded that he could not imagine things otherwise. Yet the Englishman&#8217;s disgust with fungal smut is an acquired cultural trait, not instinctive in the human species. The Indians of the Valley of Mexico have always considered smut a culinary delicacy. The kind they use grows on maize, and &#8216;ustilago maydis&#8217; seems to be its scientific designation. But in the market place the Nahuatl name, <i>cuitlacoche</i>, circulates in Spanish too, and the best families of Spanish descent delight in eating <i>cuitlacoche</i> prepared in a variety of ways. Moreover, when English-speaking guests taste the <i>cuitlacoche</i>, perhaps served like <i>piroshki</i> with cocktails, it moves them to rapture &#8212;&#8203; until they discover that they are eating smut. The Nahuatl word is built from <i>cuitlatl</i>, &#8216;excrement&#8217;. Today, as we have already said, in standard High German the toad is no longer linked with the fungi, though traces of this association survive in Penn- sylvania Dutch. Yet in the German mushroom manuals we occasionally find <i>Krötenschwamm</i> as a common name for the poisonous amanita pantherina. Perhaps this is one of those mushroom names that circulate only in manuals. But the same word applied to the same species appeared in the treatise on mushrooms by Carolus Clusius published in 1601<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b5-fn6" id="cp5b5-r6">[6]</a></sup>, and we suspect that it was current in his day. If so, and if we are right about the source of <i>Krote</i>, it follows that toads and dung were intermingled in the minds of simple Germans, and both were linked with fungi in <i>Krötenschwamm</i>. If we have successfully recaptured the semantic associations and feelings of the people who used these humble words, then here we discover a very citadel of mycophobia, where toads and fungi with loathing were spewed forth on the dungheap. Against this background, it becomes clearer that &#8216;frogcheese&#8217;, &#8216;toadsmeat&#8217;, and the Welsh &#8216;toad&#8217;s cheese&#8217;, as well as the French <i>pain de crapaud,</i> hark back to excretions of toads, rather than to food that toads were supposed to eat. We have seen that the Surselva countryman thinks of puff balls as the droppings of crows. R. C. A. Prior in his treatise on English plant names, published almost a century ago, suggested that the stool of &#8216;pixie-stool&#8217; referred to the devil&#8217;s droppings. He was mistaken, but doubtless in the long course of English speech there have been others whose mycophobic thoughts turned to dung as they spat out the expletive &#8216;toadstool&#8217;. When the English caricaturist devised a satirical coat of arms for Bonaparte, his symbol for the Corsican Devil was a toadstool, and it sprang from dung, the lineage that he thought befitted his villain. True to the Englishman&#8217;s unfailing ignorance in fungal matters, the artist did not limn a deadly species, or even a fly amanita, as the reader will observe in the reproduction of this old print that we present.</p>

            <p>Some years ago an episode took place in France that was curious for various reasons, and not least because it linked birds&#8217; droppings with mushrooms. On Sunday, January 6, 1926, in the village of Bombon (550 inhabitants, eleven miles from Melun in the Department of Seine-et-Marne) the beloved and respected cure of the parish church, the Abbé Desnoyers, 50 years of age, had retired to his sacristy after Mass when twelve persons, ten women and two men, strangers to the community, burst in upon him, seized, gagged, and bound him, threw him to the floor, and proceeded to flog him with knotted cords until he almost fainted. A few minutes later the twelve assailants quietly submitted to arrest. It developed that the twelve had come by car all the way from distant Bordeaux, that they were members of a religious circle known as the Groupe de Notre-Dame des Pleurs, that they were the disciples of the founder of this little sect, one Madame Marie Mesmin, formerly a concierge, and that they attributed Madame Mesmin&#8217;s bad health to spells cast upon her by the Abbé of Bombon across hundreds of miles of intervening countryside. One of the two men, the street-sweeper Maurice Lourdin, at the Magistrate&#8217;s hearing on January 24, had no trouble in identifying the Abbé Desnoyers as Satan himself, one of the most powerful sorcerers of the age. Only by flagellation could the demon that possessed this priest be exorcised. Lourdin bore witness that the priest of Bombon had sent birds (we are not told the species, alas!) to Bordeaux carrying diseases. They had flown over Madame Mesmin&#8217;s garden, and from their droppings had sprung up a crop of fungi that took obscene shapes, whose appalling stench had smitten all and sundry with horrible diseases<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b5-fn7" id="cp5b5-r7">[7]</a></sup>. For a brief spell the Parisian press was agog with amused excitement about the happening in Bombon, and cabaret singers made much of it. Thirty years have passed, but there are those who still remember it: Aldous Huxley has recalled for us one of the refrains:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Frappons, frappons, en union<br />
                    Sur le Cure de Bombon.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The account of this anachronistic episode can be found in <i>The Times</i> in the issues of January 6, 7, and 25, 1926. The obscene fungi could only have been stinkhorns. <i>The Times</i> correspondent did not remark on the number of the assailants: twelve. With Madame Mesmin their leader, this made thirteen, the full complement of a witches&#8217; coven. We seem to be in the presence here of the posthumous twitchings of witchcraft, the religion of the Horned God, and of the folk association of fungi with excrement.</p>

            <p>In the Italian language there is a word to designate a venomous snake, <i>scorzone</i>, which is etymologically identical with one of the Spanish words for &#8216;toad&#8217;, <i>escuerzo</i>. The Basques, as we have seen on page 78, sometimes call the marasmius oreades the Viper-fungus&#8217;, <i>suge-perretxiko,</i> and sometimes the <i>zapo-perretxiko,</i> or &#8216;toad-fungus&#8217;. According to Clusius, in the 16<sup>th</sup> century two innocent kinds of mushrooms bore in German the name of <i>Natterschwamm</i>, or adder-fungus<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b5-fn8" id="cp5b5-r8">[8]</a></sup>, and the Magyar term was a translation of this &#8212;&#8203; <i>kigyó gomba</i>. Traveling farther east, we have already called attention to the &#8216;toad-fungus&#8217; and &#8216;viper-fungus&#8217; of Slovakian usage. Far more important is the Russian word <i>poganka</i>, the supreme expression among the Slavs of the folk association between the fungi and vermin. In Great Russia, <i>poganka</i> is a term of condescending affection for the inedible mushrooms: the word has lost some of its sting among the myco- philic Russians. But this same word <i>poganka</i>, derived from the Latin word for &#8216;pagan&#8217;, circulates throughout the Slavic world, and in one region or another it designates not inedible mushrooms but all things unclean: mice, rats, snakes, pimples and other organic swellings and tumors, and (in Serbia) dung. The inedible mushrooms are unclean, they are vegetable vermin, so to speak, and the word used for them was also transferred to all other vermin and filth. The presence of pimples and tumors among these meanings arrests attention, for here we hark back to our familiar theme of the <i>pogge</i> cluster.</p>

            <p>Farther east, in the Indo-Aryan world of Asia, the theme of the serpent recurs in the fungal vocabularies of various peoples, but there is no trace of the toad. The oldest figure in the fungal metaphors of these Eastern peoples is neither the hat nor the stool, but the parasol &#8212;&#8203; Sanskrit <i>chattra</i>. Perhaps the earliest surviving reference to mushrooms in Sanskrit, going back several centuries before Christ, is <i>ahi-chattra(ka)</i>, &#8216;snake&#8217;s parasol&#8217;, in the text called <i>Nirukta</i>. The same word is found in Pali, and in the Hindi <i>sāp kī chatrī</i>, all with the same meaning; and also the Persian <i>čatr-i-mār</i>. Another Hindi word for the fungi is <i>sāp kī roṭī</i>, &#8216;snake&#8217;s bread&#8217;, and a Sindhi expression is <i>sapiḍo</i>, a diminutive of <i>sapu</i>, &#8216;snake&#8217;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b5-fn9" id="cp5b5-r9">[9]</a></sup>. It is curious that elsewhere than in the Indie languages we find the &#8216;parasol&#8217; figure applied to fungi only in the Spanish dialect of Jocotán, Guatemala, as we mentioned earlier: <i>sombrilla de sapo,</i> wherein <i>sapo</i> means &#8216;toad&#8217; and not &#8216;snake&#8217;.</p>

We have not yet found corroboration for Van Sterbeeck&#8217;s statement in French sources. Van Sterbeeck relied heavily on the great <i>Historia Plantarum Universalis,</i> 1650&#8211;&#8203;1, of Jean Bauhin, who on p. 846 described a certain mushroom that he had gathered on a hill in Montbéliard called La Crotte. Did Van Sterbeeck misconstrue Bauhin&#8217;s Latin text and think the name belonged to the mushroom? Professor Georges Becker, the great mycophile, is a citizen of Montbéliard, and he has confirmed to us the former existence in that city of a hill called La Crotte, razed to make way for railroad facilities.&#160;<a href="#cp5b5-r5">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b5-fn6">His <i>Rariomm Plantarum Historia</i> (Antwerp) contained a section on mushrooms of Hungary. Clusius was Charles de Lécluse, a Frenchman of Arras. He is sometimes called the father of scientific mycology. <i>Krötenschwamm</i> has appeared recently in the <i>Kleiner Pilzatlas</i> of H. Strohschneider, Vienna, 1948, p. 22. We have discovered no modem citation of the word in High German other than in mushroom manuals. Clusius&#8217; work was a treatise on the mushrooms of the Pannonian plain (Hungary) and he gives Krottenschwammen [sic] as the German name of the mushroom (amanita pantherina) that in Magyar was called <i>bagoly gomba,</i> or &#8216;owl mushroom&#8217;. Thus the German word was certainly not a translation out of the Hungarian. Clusius also reports <i>Froschemtuel</i> [sic] as the German name for another mushroom. Here he may have been translating the Low German <i>poggenstul,</i> thus spelled by Valerius Cordus in the middle of the 16<sup>th</sup> century when he called it to the attention of the learned world in his <i>Adnotationes</i> on Dioscorides. Our own view is that these words were still current, though disappear- ing, in standard High German in the time of Clusius; that they have long been obsolete; and that the compilers of manuals retain them by oversight.&#160;<a href="#cp5b5-r6">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b5-fn7">There may be an echo of the same association between birds&#8217; droppings and fungi in a curious theory advanced to explain fairy rings by a Mr. Johnson of Wetherby, England, early in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. He thought they were caused by starlings which &#8220;when in large nights frequently alight on the ground in circles, and sometimes are known to sit a considerable time in these annular congregations&#8221;. This reference is to be found in the edition of Gilbert White&#8217;s <i>Selborne</i> annotated by Captain Thomas Brown, of which the first printing appeared in 1833, on p. 327.&#160;<a href="#cp5b5-r7">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b5-fn8"><i>Natterschwamm</i> is unrelated to the &#8216;natterjack&#8217; (vide p. 74); the English equivalent <i>of Natter</i> drops the initial letter to become &#8216;adder&#8217;; by contrast, what was originally an &#8216;atterjack&#8217; in early English added an initial &#8216;n&#8217; to become the &#8216;natterjack&#8217;.&#160;<a href="#cp5b5-r8">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b5-fn9">This Eastern word for &#8216;snake&#8217; recalls the Spanish word for &#8216;toad&#8217;, <i>sapo,</i> and suggests an analogy between this pair of words and the alternative Spanish word, <i>escuerzo,</i> &#8216;toad&#8217;, with its Italian cousin, <i>scorzone</i>, meaning &#8216;viper&#8217;. But the Spanish <i>sapo</i> and its Eastern homonym are not directly related to each other. The Spaniards could have borrowed the Eastern word only from the Spanish Gypsies, who in fact use it in the sense of &#8216;snake&#8217;. However, the Gypsies did not arrive in Spain until the 15<sup>th</sup> century, and the Spaniards were applying <i>sapo</i> to the toad long before then. We find the word in Don Juan Manuel&#8217;s <i>Libra del Caballero et del Escudero</i>, written at the beginning of the 14<sup>th</sup> century. The Hindi word comes down from the Sanskrit <i>sarpa</i>, and &#8216;serpent&#8217; belongs to the family.&#160;<a href="#cp5b5-r9">&#8617;</a></li>
