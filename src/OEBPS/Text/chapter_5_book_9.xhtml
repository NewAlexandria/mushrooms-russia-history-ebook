        <section class="main" epub:type="bodymatter chapter">
            <p><span class="initial">E</span>ast of Moscow live a Finnish people on the Volga known as the Mordvines. In their language&nbsp;<i>panggo</i>&nbsp;is the word for mushrooms. North of them and a little to the east are another Finnish tribe, the Cheremissians, and &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; for them is&nbsp;<i>ponggo.</i>&nbsp;Beyond the Urals are the settlements of the Voguls, who say <i>pangkh;</i>&nbsp;and farther east, on the banks of the River Ob, dwell the last of the Finnish folk, the Ostjaks, with&nbsp;<i>pongkh.</i>&nbsp;Scholars are disposed to accept the likelihood that these Finno-Ugrian peoples have borrowed these words from the West.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b9-fn1" id="cp5b9-r1">[1]</a></sup> Somewhat further to the east, in the valley of the Yenisei, the small tribe known as the Yenisei-Ostjaks are familiar with the amanita muscaria and call it the&nbsp;<i>hanggo.</i>&nbsp;They are unrelated ethnically or linguistically to the Finnish peoples, but they too have borrowed the same mushroomic word.</p>

            <p>But the diffusion of the word does not stop on the banks of the Yenisei. Far to the east of them are the Yukaghirs, a tribe culturally and geographically midway between the Finns and the primitive Paleo-Siberian tribes on the Pacific coast. According to Waldemar Jochelson, they are mycophobes, considering all mushrooms unclean, springing up from dogs&rsquo; urine. They have a word for fungus,&nbsp;<i>can-pai,</i>&nbsp;of which the first element means &lsquo;tree&rsquo;. Is&nbsp;<i>-pai</i>&nbsp;related to our Finnish words.</p>

            <p>If we may digress for a moment, the pejorative association of mushrooms with dogs&rsquo; urine is not peculiar to the Yukaghirs; far from it. One of the fungal words in Hindi is&nbsp;<i>k&#363;kar-mut&#257;,</i>&nbsp;&lsquo;dog&rsquo;s urine&rsquo;, and this corresponds with the Marathi term, <i>kutrya-cem mut.</i>&nbsp;The Jews of eastern Europe refrain from eating the mushrooms that they call in Yiddish&nbsp;<i>hintishe shvemlekh,</i>&nbsp;&lsquo;dog mushrooms&rsquo;, according to an informant from Chotin in Bessarabia; these are mushrooms that grow in damp places at the foot of trees, and that are believed to be contaminated by dogs. We suspect that the same idea lies behind the generic word for mushrooms of the mycophobic Ingush tribe in the Caucasus. Their word is&nbsp;<i>dzhahnuskul&rsquo;,</i>&nbsp;&lsquo;dog&rsquo;s bride&rsquo;, in which&nbsp;<i>dzhali</i>&nbsp;means &lsquo;dog&rsquo;. In the Germanic language of the Faeroe Islands,&nbsp;<i>hunda-land,</i>&nbsp;&lsquo;dog&rsquo;s urine&rsquo;, is a word for mushroom. For &lsquo;dog&rsquo; the Poles say&nbsp;<i>pies;</i>&nbsp;the feminine form of this word,&nbsp;<i>psica,</i>&nbsp;is not used, but its plural,&nbsp;<i>psice,</i> is a name bestowed on certain small mushrooms, probably coprini. In France fungi of this genus are known popularly as the&nbsp;<i>pisse-chien,</i>&nbsp;and we suspect that the deliquescent ink-caps underlie the other examples that we have cited. The <i>pisse-chien</i>&nbsp;of the French becomes&nbsp;<i>thepixacan</i>&nbsp;in the langue d&rsquo;oc: we have found it in Gascon, in Catalan, and in Majorcan, and doubtless it occurs elsewhere. The ending&nbsp;<i>-can</i>&nbsp;comes down from the Latin&nbsp;<i>caninus,</i>&nbsp;of course. When we go further afield, we discover that in the Arabic spoken by the Sudanese there is a mushroom called the &lsquo;tree-of-the-dogs&rsquo;,&nbsp;<i>shajarat al-kilab.</i>&nbsp;Arabic scholars have been puzzled by it, but surely the meaning is clear. Indeed, the association of the coprini with dogs is not without justification. Those who care to get to the bottom of the matter will find shrewd and amusing observations on the subject by Camille Fauvel in the&nbsp;<i>Supplement</i>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<i>Revue de Mycologie</i>&nbsp;of December i, 1946, wherein this former Commissaire de Police and counter-espionage agent reveals his discovery that the distribution of urinals and of the coprinus atramentarius in the environs of Paris is complementary: i.e., the fungi are seldom found within a reasonable range of a urinal, but abound beyond that range.</p>

            <p>In the Kamchatka peninsula there live, among other tribes, the folk known as Korjaks. The word for mushroom in their language is&nbsp;<i>pion -</i>&nbsp;yet another example of our word. For more than two centuries the Korjaks have enjoyed a peculiar renown among anthropologists, ever since the Swedish traveler Philip Johan von Strahlenberg discovered that they eat the dried amanita muscaria for its intoxicating virtue. It is to be observed that the Korjaks do not use the word <i>pion</i>&nbsp;for the fly agaric. This they call&nbsp;<i>wapaq,</i>&nbsp;meaning whale-bone, and here is why. The tribesmen of eastern Siberia bend spits or skewers of whalebone, insert them thus into tallow, freeze the tallow, and then scatter the lumps of frozen tallow for hapless wolves to swallow. The death-throes of the stricken beasts explain the use of the word for the fly amanita, the trigger that sends men into frenzy.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b9-fn2" id="cp5b9-r2">[2]</a></sup></p>

            <p>North of the Korjaks, in the extreme eastern corner of Siberia, facing Alaska, He the settlements of the Chukchees, a tribe related to the Korjaks. For &lsquo;fungus&rsquo; they say&nbsp;<i>pongpong</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>pompong.</i>&nbsp;This doubling of a syllable is characteristic of the Chukchee tongue. Here, then, we find the same word that we have now followed from the Mordvines in Europe across all of Siberia.</p>

            <p>The range of this word of European origin for &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; is a breathtaking thing. What is the explanation? Why should it have stabbed its way across the frozen wastes of the North to the Bering Strait? Unfortunately we know nothing about the use of our word among these remote and primitive peoples. We do not know its precise applications in the fungal world. The lexicons say that in Ostjak and Vogul it designates the fly amanita, and this is certainly true of the <i><b>hanggo</b></i> of the Yenisei-Ostjaks. We do not know which uses of fungi are in the minds of the people when they utter these words, nor what other meanings they may carry, nor the figures of speech in which they play a part, nor their role in proverbs and folklore. We know nothing of their emotional flavor. They were not borrowed from Russian, for the Russian language possesses no word that could have been their source. We do not know whether they are associated with toads.</p>

            <p>Clearly these Finnish and Siberian words come down from one of our three fungal clusters &mdash; the <i>pogge</i> or the sponge or the pumpkin group &mdash; or from a common ancestor. Is it possible that the word sped east long ago, along with a new technique for making fire &mdash; the use of punk for tinderÂ» This would suggest that the sponge cluster was the source of the word. (In considering this possibility we must keep in mind that the superior virtue of the fomes fomentarius for tinder was known in northern Europe in neolithic times, some 8,000 years ago. Perhaps punk was one of Europe&rsquo;s earliest export products.) But there is no evidence known to us to support this inviting surmise, which remains to be tested in the field. Not only should every aspect of the words for mushroom and fungus be examined, but the whole vocabulary for the primitive methods of fire-making as well &mdash; spark, tinder, flame, dust (soot), and ashes. In the course of our inquiries we have assembled straws of superficial evidence indicating a common phonetic element in the words for tinder, dust, and ashes running all the way from Europe through Siberia into the Algonquin languages. When the English colonists found the Algonquin Indians referring to ashes or dust as &lsquo;punk&rsquo;, could they have been confronting their own word, after a journey around the world?</p>

            <p>By good fortune we do know that the Korjaks use punk for tinder, though we do not know their word for it. Waldemar Jochelson in his treatise on the Korjaks, page 565, has this to say:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The ancient method of making fire, by means of a drill, is at present employed only in religious ceremonies. Since the fire-drill is esteemed as the most important protector of the family, it may be concluded that the Korjaks looked upon fire as a beneficent agent. There are sacrifices in honor of the fire; fire is also a mediator between man and the deities, since offerings are burned in it&hellip; Tinder is prepared from a fungus that grows on the stumps of birch trees. The fungus is stripped of its hard outer layer, and the inner spongy mass is boiled in water. Then it is dried, and a light, brittle, and highly inflammable punk is thus obtained.</p></blockquote>

            <p>At this point our excursion into the Arctic would have ended, had not the demon of our curiosity driven us to address a letter of inquiry to Professor L. L. Hammerich of Copenhagen, the authority on Eskimo linguistics and cultural traits. We asked him what word the Eskimos use for &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;. He replied that from Northwest Alaska to Greenland the word is <i>pupikl</i> Here we seem to discover once again the phonetic unit that by now we know so well. Professor Hammerich went on to say that the word is used for various diseases &mdash; in Greenland for leprosy; in the Kuskokwim district of Alaska for an eruption, itch, or small-pox. (The reader will recall that Low German <i>pogge</i> is etymologically cognate with &lsquo;pox&rsquo;, and the European words are constantly associated with tumors and organic growths. Leprosy is often accompanied by gross physical deformities.) At Nelson Island <i>pupiki</i> is a person with small-pox. Then Professor Hammerich continues:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In the mind of an Eskimo the word <i>pupik</i> must needs associate itself with the root <i>pu,</i> &lsquo;inflate, rise to the surface&rsquo;; cf., e. g., Greenland <i>pue,</i> &lsquo;tumor'; <i>puak,</i> &lsquo;lung'; <i>poq,</i> &lsquo;inflated bag&rsquo;; <i>puisse,</i> &lsquo;seal&rsquo; (which pops out of the sea); Kuskokwim <i>pugoq,</i> &lsquo;rises to the surface&rsquo;; <i>pugtartoq,</i> &lsquo;the seal emerges from the water for air&rsquo;; and <i>pugtaun,</i> &lsquo;inflated bladder&rsquo;.</p></blockquote>

            <p>The reader who has followed step by step our argument will share the excitement that Professor Hammerich&rsquo;s letters justify. Phonetically and semantically the information that he supplies seems to place the Eskimos with the Europeans in what we might call the same mushroom orbit. What is the explanation?</p>

            <p>Before suggesting certain possibilities, there is additional evidence to submit, also supplied by Professor Hammerich. Among the Eskimos who live south of the Bering Strait, the word <i>pupik</i> in the sense of &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; seems to be unknown. Thus on the island of Nunivak mushrooms are <i>tumrat ciutait,</i> or &lsquo;devil&rsquo;s ears&rsquo; â a metaphor that echoes the demonic theme of the North Sea mushroom vocabulary, and also the common name of the hirneola auricula-judse of the mycologists, a species of edible tree fungus known in certain European vernaculars as the Jew&rsquo;s ears or Judas&rsquo; ears. The Aleuts, who are not Eskimos but whose culture is Eskimoid, use an expression that is semantically identical, <i>qu&#285;am tutuca,</i> &lsquo;devil&rsquo;s ear&rsquo;. There is current today among certain specialists in Eskimo matters a theory that the culture of the Eskimos originated in Southwestern Alaska and radiated thence north and east to Greenland. We might look then to the Eskimos of that region for evidence of the archaic mushroom nomenclature. However, our information about the attitude toward mushrooms of the Eskimos is still so meager that it would be premature to draw inferences from the distinctive terminology that seems to be current among the Aleuts and neighboring Eskimos. Careful inquiries specifically directed to our theme would probably uncover much information now unsuspected. On its face, a term like &lsquo;devil&rsquo;s ear&rsquo; for a mushroom sounds like a euphemism replacing an older term that has fallen under a tabu.</p>

            <p>There is yet further evidence of a common substratum in the Eskimo and European fungal thinking. Arthur Thibert in his Eskimo dictionary published in 1954 gives <i>tunnuksak</i> for &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;. Professor Hammerich informs us that this word means literally &lsquo;something like a tallowy boil&rsquo;. In the old dictionary of Eskimo as spoken in Northern Alaska, by R. Wells and John W. Kelly, published in 1890, the word for &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; is <i>ahyo&rsquo;ok,</i> where again the sense is &lsquo;swelling&rsquo;, &lsquo;boil&rsquo;. Thibert also gives <i>puyut</i> in the sense of &lsquo;dried mushroom&rsquo;; the Eskimo word&rsquo;s literal meaning is &lsquo;means of making smoke&rsquo;. Do we not re-discover here the early use of dried mushrooms for generating smoke that gave to English the word &lsquo;funk&rsquo;? We can carry these recurring themes to a higher plane. In the Eskimo dialect of East Greenland the earliest Danish scholars concerned with Eskimo linguistics discovered a word for mushroom that is written thus: <i>tarndydp poqattd.</i> It has been closely examined by a long series of eminent authorities: John Petersen, William Thalbitzer, L. L. Hammerich, and Erik Holtved. They agree that it means &lsquo;the hunting bag of the little robber of souls&rsquo;, the second element, which begins with our familiar syllable <i>poq-,</i> being the bag and the first element being derived from <i>tame,</i> &lsquo;soul&rsquo;. Here then, exactly as in northern Europe, is an association of mushrooms with psychic or demonic powers.</p>

            <p>The Eskimos thus link mushrooms with tumors, small-pox, and inflated bladders, and on another level with psychic disturbance, and phonetically we re-discover among the Eskimos words that suggest our <i>pogge</i> cluster. There are several possible explanations for this surprising parallel.</p>

            <p>First, the word that we have pursued across Siberia to the Chukchee <i>pongpong</i> may have leaped the Bering Strait and spread across the top of America, by-passing the southwestern Eskimos. On the western shores of the Bering Strait live the Asiatic Eskimos, in cultural contact with the Chukchees. To weigh our initial hypothesis, we should ascertain the word used by the Asiatic Eskimos for mushroom. This word is not known to us, and as the Asiatic Eskimos cannot now be reached, the question remains unanswerable. Phonetically <i>pongpong</i> could become <i>pupik,</i> for Professor Hammerich points out to us that the Asiatic Eskimo <i>saming,</i> &lsquo;wherewith&rsquo;, becomes <i>sumik</i> in Greenland, and the Asiatic Eskimo <i>tamlaxtoq,</i> &lsquo;brings to the shore&rsquo;, becomes <i>tulagtoq</i> in Greenland. But the difficulties with the loan surmise are serious. When a people absorb into their vocabulary a word taken from their neighbors, they do so to fill a specific need, and they care nothing for the etymological and semantic associations of the borrowed word. Such associations become dilute or are lost altogether, and <i>a fortiori</i> when the borrowed word has filtered through a series of languages. If, then, the Eskimo <i>tookpupik</i> from the Chukchee <i>pongpong,</i> we are constrained to <i>divorce pupik</i> from the cluster of Eskimo words referring to tumors, skin eruptions, and distensible sacs with which the Eskimos themselves, with happy insight, consciously link it.</p>

            <p>A second possibility is that the Eskimos once dwelt far to the West, in contact with peoples of European cultural stock, and took over the word and its associations intact, and then preserved them in a singular deep-freeze, until today we of European stock have re-discovered this cultural common denominator with us. Fanciful as such a suggestion sounds, serious scholars such as C. C. Uhlenbeck have discovered numerous verbal roots that seem to be identical in Eskimo and in the Indo-European languages, and have postulated a remote period of cultural contiguity between the two worlds.</p>

            <p>Third, we must consider multiple genesis: that is, the possibility that an onomatopceic root could spring up in more than one place in response to an identical imitative instinct. If this were the explanation, we should expect to find yet other peoples as remote culturally as the Eskimos from Europe who will be found to possess indigenous&nbsp;<i>pupik</i>&nbsp;clusters of mushroom words.</p>

            <p>Each of these explanations, examined severally, inspires little confidence. There remains a fourth possibility.</p>

            <p>Let us go behind the common Indo-European language that is the hypothetical ancestor of all the Indo-European tongues of today, to that earlier linguistic stratum from which common Indo-European was itself descended. The archetype of our mushroomic root may descend lineally to us and to the Eskimos, as well as those Siberian peoples that possess it, from the era before our own linguistic family was differentiated from an earlier stock. In this case the Eskimo&nbsp;<i>pupik</i>&nbsp;is not a loan word from Indo-European, nor is (s)p(h)ongo a root borrowed by Indo-Europeans from some other linguistic family. We are simply carrying back our linguistic tree to a remoter generation.</p>

            <p>On page 109 in a footnote we pointed out that certain philologists consider <i>fungus</i>&nbsp;and ÏÏÏÎ³Î³Î¿Ï as words of pre-Indo-European origin, taken originally from some lost Mediterranean language. They question the identity of these words with the German&nbsp;<i>Schwamm</i>&nbsp;and the Slavic&nbsp;<i>gamba.</i>&nbsp;The conjecture that we now offer would reconcile the apparent contradiction. We would concede that in languages remote from the Indo-European family we find true cognates of ÏÏÏÎ³Î³Î¿Ï. We would suppose that this word, as it descended through the Indo-European line, assumed a variant aspect in the Germanic and Slavic worlds.</p>

            <p>The persistence through many millennia of a recognizable root for the word that signifies &lsquo;fungus&rsquo; would be a remarkable thing. It might testify to the singular importance of the role of the fungal world in the culture of these exceedingly remote ancestors of ours. The religious and mythological and erotic associations of the mushrooms would explain this role, associations that we are still able to detect, though today they fade from men&rsquo;s memories and must be sought by combing the oldest records. Furthermore, these associations are of the very kind that would explain the dichotomy between mycophobic and mycophilic peoples. Things that involve man&rsquo;s deepest emotions are viewed by him through a&nbsp;<i>mana</i>&nbsp;of supernatural potency. That which is tabu is both feared and loved, unclean and holy, shunned and worshipped. As the old beliefs slowly faded away, each cultural community, no longer able to maintain alive the balanced tensions of the original involvement, clung to one face or the other of the primitive emotions, either rejecting the mushroom world or embracing the strange growths with a quasi-erotic devotion.</p>
