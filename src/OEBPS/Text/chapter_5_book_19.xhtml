            <h2>19<br/>Mushrooms In Art</h2>
        </header>
        <section class="main" epub:type="bodymatter chapter">
            <p>Mushrooms are rare in art. In the Christian world they appear first and chiefly as illustrations for mycological texts, primarily utilitarian in purpose. Today our mycological illustrations approach perfection in some of the slick color engravings of modern mushroom manuals. Henri Fabre's water colors might also fall under this heading. But Fabre succeeded in doing more than merely catch the details significant for the student of mushrooms. He perceived and caught with his brush the eerie strangeness of these diverse creatures, he caught their grace and mystery, and in his finest compositions he far transcended the humble functions of the faithful illustrator.</p>

            <p>In the earliest illustrations of mushrooms there was a singular unevenness of quality. Already in Plate XXXII we have shown how excellently a miniaturist in the zoth century represented the truffle, and how absurd was the first printed representation of that same truffle (fig. 10), published in Mainz in 1491. On Plate XXII we reproduced from the same loth century Codex the illustration of the fomes officinalis, and in contrast with the excellence of the truffle, the miniaturist here indulged in a startling aberration based on a popular notion that this shelf fungus possessed sexuality of a quasi-human kind. On the other hand, in the <i><span xml:lang=”la” lang=”la”>Hortus Sanitatis</span></i> where the ill-begotten truffle appeared, the fomes officinalis was rather well portrayed, growing correctly on the trunk of a larch.</p>

            <p>The successive scribes who copied the manuscript of Dioscorides seem to have followed various traditions in their illustrations, imitating the predecessor whose work lay before them. The earliest mushroom miniature known to us is in the 8<sup>th</sup> century codex of Dioscorides now lying in the Bibliotheque Nationale.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b19-fn1" id="cp5b19-r1">[1]</a></sup> There the mushrooms look like balloons or cherries or gooseberries. In the same library there is an nth century (or slightly later) Arabic manuscript of Dioscorides, and it is clear that here the miniaturist was working in the same uninspired tradition, if indeed he was not copying from the 9<sup>th</sup> century manuscript directly. The Freer Gallery in Washington possesses a page from yet another Arabic version, this one written in the year 1224, and here the same globular forms have degenerated far indeed.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, in the Morgan 10<sup>th</sup> century codex there appear three capped mushrooms of superior lineage, and we permit ourselves to believe that they originated with the same artist who depicted the truffle. How exciting it would be to discover who he was and when he lived, the original begetter of this truffle and these mushrooms! Was he perhaps Dioscorides himself, or that mysterious master whom Dioscorides revered - Cratevas, attendant at the Court of Mithridates Eupator a century before Christ? Except in the various recensions of Dioscorides, we have found mushrooms in only one medieval</p>

            <p>manuscript, the illuminated initial in Aldobrandino da Siena's <i><span xml:lang=”fr” lang=”fr”>Le Livre pour la Sante du Corps</span>.</i> And here we discover for the first time a sense of composition. Six of the mushrooms in this initial might stem back to the illustrations in the Morgan Dioscorides, but boldly rising above them is a good representation of a craterellus. We reproduce on Plate LVI this illuminated initial from the Aldobrandino manuscript in the Morgan collection, written probably in Rouen about the year 1450, but copied perhaps from earlier versions going back a century or two.</p>

            <p>With the <i>Hortus Sanitatis</i> in 1491, the tradition of the printed illustration of mushrooms began. In the 1550's the Italian Pietro Andrea Mattioli brought out his <i>Commentaries</i> on Dioscorides, and this important book quickly passed through many editions. From the French version published in Lyons in 1578 we reproduce the woodcut accompanying the chapter on mushrooms. Here for the first time we discover mushrooms in their habitat, growing around a stump, with snakes about and 'flies' in the air. The illustrator was doing his best to cope with his text and for the first time mushrooms were being portrayed against their natural background, as it was then conceived.</p>

            <p>Europe's storehouse of art is primarily religious in inspiration, and the religious art of Europe ignores the whole fungal world. This is not surprising, for mushrooms are not mentioned in the Bible<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b19-fn2" id="cp5b19-r2">[2]</a></sup> nor in the Apocrypha nor in the writings of the Early Church Fathers. Unless we make an exception for the Czech folk tale that we recounted in Volume I, mushrooms seem never to figure in hagiographical legends. The deplorable truth must be faced: the Christian religion has no mushrooms in it anywhere. True, four Saints speak of them, but of these, three were scholars writing on natural history.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b19-fn3" id="cp5b19-r3">[3]</a></sup> This leaves the fourth, and let us turn to what that great man had to say.</p>

            <p>We have seen on an earlier page in what low esteem the Protestant divine Jeremy Taylor held mushrooms. Only a few decades before Taylor's disparaging remarks, St. Francis of Sales in Geneva was giving vent to kindred emotions in that extraordinary classic of Catholic piety, the <i>Introduction to the Devout</i> <i>Life.</i> St. Francis and the Protestant clergyman speak from the identical mycophobic tradition, and undoubtedly in the case of these moralists the vogue in their day of certain fungi as aphrodisiacs reinforced their natural feelings. In Chapter 33 of Part 3 of St. Francis's book, he turns his attention to 'balls, and other permissible but dangerous pastimes', and then he goes on:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>I say to you about dances, Philotee, what the doctors say about <i>potirons</i> and <i>champignons,</i> the best are worthless&hellip; If nevertheless you must eat mushrooms, see to it that they are well prepared. If for some reason you cannot get out of going to a dance, see to it that your dancing is well considered &hellip; Eat few mushrooms and eat them seldom, say the doctors, for no matter how well prepared they are, in quantity they are venomous. Dance little and seldom, Philotee, for otherwise you expose yourself to the danger of becoming addicted thereto. According to Pliny, mushrooms being spongy and porous easily draw to themselves any infection in the neighborhood, so that when near serpents they draw to themselves the serpents' venom.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Similarly, continues St. Francis, dances attract vice and sin. And just as after mushrooms it is wise to drink precious wine as an antitoxin, so after dances one should concentrate on holy thoughts.</p>

            <p>With mushrooms virtually ignored in Christian writings, it is not surprising that they hardly figure in the mighty river of traditional European art. When once we leave aside the illustrations to mycological texts and turn to the main corpus of European painting, they are almost wholly absent until the 16<sup>th</sup> century. We have already discussed on pages 87 ff. the effigy of a Satanic boletus in Bosch's Hay Wain. This is the earliest mushroom known to us by an Old Master.</p>

            <p>The second is in the same tradition, by a Fleming who was surely a mycophobe, Peter Brueghel the Elder. In his allegorical painting <i>The Misanthrope,</i> dated 1568 and now hanging in the Museo Nazionale in Naples, an aged man clothed in mourning advances to the left across the open fields, leaving behind him an horizon apparently aflame with fire and war. A thief, having overtaken him from behind, is slyly cutting the cord from which the old man's purse is hanging. The thief is enframed in a shadowy sphere that represents The World. Beneath the painting is an inscription in Dutch:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Om dat de Werelt is soe ongetru<br/>
                    Daer om gha ic in den ru.</p>
                <p>Because the world is so untrue<br/>
                    Therefore go I in mourning.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The face of the old man is not saintly, and it is said that Brueghel himself hesitated about the name to give to the picture: <i>False Hermit</i> and the <i>Hypocrite</i> were two of his choices. (Here is our perfect illustration for <i>Tartuffe</i>!) On the path before the pilgrim are three caltrops, sharp metal points of the kind that the soldiery in Brueghel's time would strew for enemy horses to step on. For us the exciting detail in this picture is the presence, close above the metal points, of two mushrooms, and a cluster of vaguely discernible mushrooms to the immediate right of the tree stump. Here again is the 'Devil's bread' of Bosch. These mushrooms suggest boleti, but with the passing centuries the painting has deteriorated and the species cannot be identified. Surely it is fair to assume that they are the <i>heksenzwam</i> or <i>satanzwam,</i> bathed in the aura of witches or Satan. Bosch in his painting developed his own iconographic idiom. It is Christian but unconventional: the <i>Hay Wain</i> is a strange allegory framed inside the Christian cosmogony. Brueghel's mushrooms are an iconographic symbol in a painted homily of profane rather than sacred inspiration. Within the confines of conventional Christian iconography we know of only two paintings, in all the wealth of Christian art, where mushrooms figure. We are indebted to the Director of the Prado Museum, Dr. Sanchez Canton, for drawing to our attention one of them. In the Prado there hangs a superb <i>Adoration of the Magi,</i> painted c. 1610 by Juan Bautista Mayno, an artist of the Spanish school about whom little is known beyond the fact that he was a Spanish Dominican born in Italy. His <i>Adoration</i> bears witness to his high quality as a painter. His craftsmanship is impeccable, his composition noble, the delicacy of the figures and faces breathtaking. In the foreground, down below, are two inconspicuous mushrooms growing among some leaves by the side of an unhewn stone. The mushrooms belong to the agaricaceae, for one of them shows a ring. The base of the stipe is concealed by vegetation: we cannot say whether there is a volva. The mushrooms and their boulder are a sinister counterpoise to the Light of the World shining through the aperture from above. Exactly what do they mean?</p>

            <p>For Bosch in the <i>Hay Wain,</i> for Brueghel in <i>The Misanthrope,</i> mushrooms were a symbol of the forces of Satan, and we think that the same meaning attaches to the mushrooms in Mayno's painting.</p>

            <p>The Virgin on her finely chiseled block of stone is goodness, truth, and beauty. The boulder with the mushrooms growing in a marshy spot is the realm of unregenerate nature that is now to be offered redemption. Mushrooms belonged to that armory of demonic symbols which painters used in the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries when preaching to the world about Satan and his works. It is true that they used mushrooms sparingly, but the symbolism is abundantly clear. Much more common as symbols of the infernal forces were serpents, lizards, frogs and toads, beetles, and flying insects; in short, all those creatures commonly thrown together under the pejorative name of Vermin'.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b19-fn4" id="cp5b19-r4">[4]</a></sup></p>

            <p>Our interpretation of these early mushrooms finds support in a painting by a fourth master, Herri met de Bles known as Civetta, 'the Owl', who died in 1550. Of the Flemish school, by cultural heritage he belonged to the world of Bosch and Brueghel. In the Gemaldegalerie der Akademie der bildenden Kiinste, Vienna, there hangs his <i>Christ Bearing the Cross,</i> a small and exquisite canvas. The field of the iconographic message in this painting is enframed in the foreground by a close-up of rough untilled land. We were the first to detect in this foreground, near the center, two clumps of minute and delicately delineated mushrooms, and a third clump of the same genus is in the lower right hand corner. Only by the aid of a powerful magnifying glass can they be fully perceived and properly admired. These mushrooms are off-stage, so to speak, and they might be dismissed as a graceful but meaningless phantasy, did we not recall the sinister meaning of the mushrooms in the works of Bosch and Brueghel. We lean to the view that here also the mushrooms are symbolic of the Powers of Darkness, who in this case are working out their woeful role on the highway to Golgotha.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b19-fn5" id="cp5b19-r5">[5]</a></sup></p>

            <p>In the Dutch still-life paintings of the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries there was a delayed manifestation of the demonic theme in art, a strange and lovely afterglow that is of peculiar interest to us for the role in it of mushrooms. Among the scores of accomplished Dutch artists who were at work between 1640 and 1770 were a handful who chose woodland settings for subjects, closeups of woodland undergrowth, in which we discover serpents, lizards, frogs and toads, beetles, and flying insects. Often the artists added mushrooms of various species. These Dutch masters were offering to their customers paintings of Vermin', creatures that from earliest times had symbolized the Satanic powers. A century had elapsed since the elder Brueghel's day, and the world had gone through the spiritual upheaval of the Reformation. The minor creatures of the woodland still trailed clouds of evil, but the dark emotions that they now evoked were only reflexes of the former nightmares. They were terrors recalled in tranquillity and suitable for esthetic delectation.</p>

            <p>The originator of this theme in Dutch still-lifes was none other than Otto Marseus van Schrieck, whose <i>Moth with Mushrooms</i> we have already discussed. Born in the second decade of the 17<sup>th</sup> century, he died in the late 1670's. No one knows under what master he studied. Little is certain about his life beyond the fact that he lived long in Italy, that he was in Rome in 1652, that he enjoyed considerable success in his day, and that his peculiar choice of subjects set a fashion which persisted for a century and more. It is said that, after his return to Holland, he kept a small private zoo in the garden of his home near Amster- dam where the creatures that he loved to paint were always ready for his brush. He was surnamed 'Snuffelaar', one who ferrets.</p>

            <p>Van Schrieck was an artist whose work records a deep cultural transition. On the one hand, he was saturated in the sinister folklore attaching to the humble creatures that he put on canvas, the dark heritage of past beliefs. Was he not in fact the last genuine painter of the demonic tradition? On the other hand, he was the discoverer of beauty in the lowliest and most despised woodland creatures. He raised even Vermin' to the democracy of the artist's beauteous world. For the first time snakes and toads were to give esthetic pleasure. He was the first European to perceive and proclaim the visual beauty of mushrooms. He studied nature with minute care. A snake was no longer just a snake: it was a particular species of snake. A mushroom was not just a toadstool, not the Idea of a fungus such as Bosch had given us. The mushroom world was peopled with an infinite variety of discrete growths, each worthy of distinct and precise delineation.</p>

            <p>Was not Van Schrieck, in a significant sense, the earliest of the nature painters? Of course many artists before him had caught the beauty of a landscape. Giants like Diirer and Leonardo had executed superb studies of individual plants or animals. Various miniaturists had ornamented the margins of manuscripts with the profile of a bird or bush, catching to perfection the distinctive line of each. But Van Schrieck added a new element: centuries before Audubon and before scientists began to talk about 'ecology', this Dutch painter sensed the importance of the ensemble of nature, the interdependence of plants and insects and mushrooms and the wild creatures that lived in the undergrowth. Long before Linnaeus and the classification of species, he was distinguishing the species with his artist's eye, and observing the cycle of life in which each lives as a link. He was the first artist whom naturalists can call their own. All those who hold wild nature in honor, and especially all amateurs of mushrooms, will pay homage to this neglected Dutch master, this pioneer in the exploration of nature's wonders.</p>

            <p>A peculiarity of Van Schrieck was his addiction to nocturnal settings. Was there ever other artist who so specialized in painting the night? How sensitive his imagination was to the Stygian blackness of deep night in the woodland undergrowth! He seems to begrudge even that light which he is forced to use to give us a picture at all. What we discover in his paintings is caught by the dazzling illumination from an off-stage light, and the shaft that comes from off stage stops short with the creatures that he paints. The moth is caught in air as by a flashlight, but the light does not race on around the moth to strike elsewhere. This effect reminds us of those modern spotlights designed with mathematical nicety to illuminate the exact area of a canvas or a sculpture. Of course Van Schrieck's settings are artificial, like most settings in museums of natural history, but each component in the picture is vibrant with life and individuality. The artist is not content with painting symbols and effigies as iconographs. He is not content with dead models. The demonic message is there in the nocturnal scene, but conveyed by living individuals caught in the dance of life and death. His settings suggest in a way an aquarium, for the buoyancy of the night air makes itself felt in the way all the creatures and the vegetation seem to float in a life-sustaining medium. The three Van Schriecks that we reproduce are chosen for their emphasis on mushrooms. Almost all his paintings include mushrooms, but these are extreme in this respect, as also for the blackness of the night.</p>

            <p>Our artist's peculiar qualities find full expression in the painting that hangs in the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum in Brunswick. Dated 1662, it was probably executed in Amsterdam. Van Schrieck had just returned from his long sojourn abroad. As usual, the setting is crepuscular. A tulip is overborne in the coils of a snake of the species elaphe quatuor-lineata. To the right flies one of the saturnine moths. A viper is hissing below, and on the ground we discover a bufo calamita ('calamity toad') licking up a slug. This is the toad that the English name the natterjack. On the left a snake that herpetologists call the coluber viridi-flavus emerges from behind a clavaria botrytis and then curls through a cluster of three mushrooms, of which the one in the middle is a russula and the others are Csesar's amanitas. Flies are crawling on the amanitas, and as <i>Fliegenschwamm</i> in Van Schrieck's day was a name bestowed on various species, he may have expected his public to call these mushrooms by that name. The air hangs thick with evil import, yet each detail is executed with the care of one who enters fully into the beauty of nature's cruel cycle. Van Schrieck's painting long antedated the scientists' nomenclature, of course; with the artist's eye he was anticipating their labors.</p>

            <p>Van Schrieck's success in his lifetime should not surprise us. He was born into circles with a sophisticated palate for art, and his contribution was an original and notable one. He disclosed the beauty of the wilderness with a subtlety that far surpassed his predecessors. The labored efforts of the early scientific writers were tedious by comparison with his discourses on wild nature expressed in line and color. His mushrooms are incomparably superior to those of the professional illustrators who supplied woodcuts for the text of Clusius, Bauhin &amp; Co. His influence soon took hold of other artists, some of whom achieved a more lasting reputation than he. The Neapolitan painter Paolo Porpora surnamed Pavoluccio Napolitano, a contemporary, imitated Van Schrieck repeatedly: two Porporas painted in this vein hang in the gallery of the Banco di Napoli in Naples, and of these we reproduce one.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b19-fn6" id="cp5b19-r6">[6]</a></sup> Abraham Begeyn, about twenty years younger than Van Schrieck, revelled like him in woodland subjects and mushrooms, as did also the mysterious Frans Hamilton,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b19-fn7" id="cp5b19-r7">[7]</a></sup> Anthonie van Borssom, and the German, Johann Albert Angermayer. Later in the same vein came Rachel Ruysch, who lived into the mid-i8th century, and Franz Werner Tamm, born in 1724. All of these distinguished artists loved their rrmshrooms and knew them, though not like Van Schrieck. Van Schrieck's influence went even beyond them. It may be said of him that he effected the integration of mushrooms into the idiom of painters. Before him in all of the painting of Europe the absence of mushrooms is conspicuous, if not absolute. In settings where mushrooms would seem almost compulsory, there were none, as though good taste compelled good artists to rub them out. After Van Schrieck, mushrooms are never again a surprise. Though rare, they recur sporadically and naturally whenever barnyard and outdoor themes seem to call for them.</p>

            <p>Those other painters who borrowed Van Schrieck's peculiar theme were less attached to the demonic import of the subject matter than he was. They admitted more light than he did. They would show a patch of daylight sky. They introduced daytime birds. They prettified the whole setting. Van Schrieck's paintings repel the uninitiated by their darkness, while his followers' possess a superficial charm as quaint period pieces. But what they gained in gentleness they lost in focus. They were satisfied with fewer species of mushrooms, and showed a tendency to stylize them, like stage properties. Their snakes and insects tend to be less sharply delineated. In those art circles where the extraordinary merits of the Dutch still-life painters are esteemed, Mignon and Ruysch today rank above Van Schrieck. From one point of view this is a mistake. For connoisseurs both of cultural history and natural history Van Schrieck should stand first. He is unique, a cultural <i>trait d'union</i> between the world of demonic folk beliefs and the beautiful world of nature, where even the lowliest creatures are infinitely precious for the understanding eye.</p>

            <p>By good fortune we are privileged to attend the very act of artistic alchemy by which Van Schrieck's peculiar quality was transmuted to suit the conventional taste. The year is 1668. Van Schrieck after years of wandering is back in Amsterdam, active and honored, in his early 5o's. Melchior de Hondecoeter, a brilliant young artist of 34, paints a picture after the Van Schrieck manner, with mushrooms, lizard, and butterflies. We can study it today in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. He retains Van Schrieck's nocturnal effect, devising a powerful off-stage light to the left to bathe with dazzling effulgence the foliage and mushrooms on the right. The mushrooms, well delineated, belong to the genus hypholoma and are probably of the species hypholoma fasciculare. Finches in full panoply occupy the center of the canvas, aroused by the presence of a lizard. Some daylight enters from the upper right. The artist signs his painting on the tree-trunk below the knot-hole, and no one challenges the attribution. Hondecoeter was destined to win renown for his skill in painting birds. Almost two centuries before Audubon, he achieved the impossible by catching the stance of a bird in its moment of intense vital performance, and in this work he was already on his chosen path of special achievement.</p>

            <p>Now let us turn from the Hondecoeter in the Rijksmuseum to another version of the same painting in the National Gallery in London. It is signed above the knot-hole and dated 1668.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b19-fn8" id="cp5b19-r8">[8]</a></sup> Here the artist has reassembled the mushrooms, foliage, birds, butterflies, tree-trunk, and patch of sky. Each of the elements carries the same light effects as in the Amsterdam work, but with the re- distribution of the parts, the Van Schrieck effect of concentrated off-stage high-lighting is sharply diminished. In these two paintings we see the brilliant artist of the younger generation, still under the spell of Van Schrieck, experimenting with the master's methods. In the second he retains mushrooms and Vermin' but abandons the nocturnal trance.</p>


            <p>There is a noteworthy thing about the mushrooms painted by Van Schrieck and those who followed in his wake: for them all, the attraction of the mushroom seems to have been visual. They discovered that mushrooms, bathed in folklore, were also beautiful, and then they stopped. Is there a single Dutch or German painting of the iyth or 18<sup>th</sup> century in which mushrooms appear in a context of food; These hereditary mycophobes permitted themselves to be seduced by mushrooms, but not all the way. More than a century before Van Schrieck, Jan Brueghel the Elder, known as Velvet Brueghel, executed two series of paintings to illustrate the corporeal senses, and today they hang in the Prado. Twice he represented the delights of the palate in a riot of foods of all kinds, but among them are no mushrooms. Admirable as Van Schrieck and his followers were, it seems certain that they followed in Jan Brueghel's train and never knew the epicure's delight in a cep or morel. As in the case of Thoreau, mushrooms never made their saliva run. When they painted mushrooms with exquisite perception, they made no distinction between the edible and the inedible: clearly for them all were inedible. Thus Paolo Porpora in his canvas that we reproduce coils his serpents and lizards through a cluster of delectable morels. A painter discovers and reveals such truth as lies within the compass of his visual dimension, and these Dutch artists triumphed over their ancestral mycophobia within the medium at their command but no further.</p>

            <p>In Van Schrieck's time we have seen that mycophagy was burgeoning among the Flemings, but this cultural innovation seems to have had no parallel among the Dutch. How odd that the line of demarcation between the Protestant and Catholic worlds should also separate the mycophobes from the mycophagists! There must be exceptions, but just as no Dutchman or German seems to have painted mushrooms in a context of food, so we have found no painter after Brueghel identified with Brussels or Antwerp who used mushrooms as a demonic symbol. Though the still-life artists of the iyth century never tired of painting food, it is a fact that even in Flanders mushrooms figure seldom in those paintings. In addition to those that we have discussed on pages 130 if., there is a superb still-life of the school of Zurbaran in the Art Institute of Chicago, wherein two specimens of the psalliota arvensis (as we think them to be) appear, along with chestnuts, cheese, almonds, and grapes. Robert Graves in Majorca possesses a canvas dated 1656 with a fine show of <i>rovellons</i> (lactarius sanguifluus), which the Catalans esteem above all others, and this canvas is attributed to the Majorcan artist Antonio Mesquida.</p>

            <p>The oldest painting of mushrooms in the world is a fresco discovered in the excavations at Herculaneum early in the i8th century and now hanging in the Museo Nazionale in Naples. It must have been executed around A.D. 50, perhaps at the very moment when Pliny was composing his chapters on the fungi for his <i>Historia Naturalis.</i> These mushrooms seem to belong to the genus lactarius and are obviously for eating. All of the specific names for mushrooms that we know from classical Latin have been securely identified, and there is none that we can attach to those in this ancient fresco. Here is a wholesome reminder of how little we really know about the mycological knowledge of the ancients, for we may consider it virtually certain that the ancient inhabitants of Herculaneum knew the mushrooms of the fresco well and had a name for them.</p>

            <p>There is a remarkable thing about this Herculaneum fresco. Let the reader compare our reproduction of it with Jan Fyt's canvas, Plate XXIV. In both, mushrooms are scattered in the foreground. In both there are thrushes, stiff in death, laid out on a ledge above and behind, in the fresco mistle thrushes or turdus viscivorus, in Fyt both mistle thrushes and fieldfares or the turdus pilaris. These artists separated by sixteen centuries hit on the same objects for their two still-lifes, and the same composition. The fresco could not have influenced Fyt, of course, for apparently it was not exhumed from its volcanic grave until a century after Fyt's time.</p>

            <p>The mushroom in Renaissance art was originally and principally demonic in suggestion, as we have seen. In the lovely paintings of Rachel Ruysch and F. W. Tamm this demonic vein had spent itself, petering out in the placid calms of the i8th century enlightenment. Mycophagy was gaining ground, and in addition Gainsborough and later Corot discovered the idyllic beauty of mushroom gathering - a far cry from the terrors of the mushroom in the world of Bosch and Brueghel and Civetta. But the old theme was not altogether dead: after all, it had sprung from the very tap roots of Europe's earliest cultural world, the mycophobia of the Germanic world that gave us Bosch and Brueghel. One of the eminent illustrators in 19<sup>th</sup> century France was the artist J.J. Grandville. He died in the spring of 1847, at 44 years of age. On the eve of his death he submitted to the&nbsp;<i>Magasin Pittoresque</i>&nbsp;two woodcuts of astonishing quality, which in due course that journal published.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b19-fn9" id="cp5b19-r9">[9]</a></sup> These last works of his were pictorial representations of dreams. The first does not concern us. We reproduce the second and suggest that the reader examine it with some attention. Grandville submitted his explanation for this dream, a banal sequence of mean- ingless images, as he thought. Perhaps this design expressed more than even so sensitive an artist as Grandville was aware of. Reading from top to bottom, the sliver of a moon emerges as a mushroom. By way of an intermediate metamorphosis, the mushroom becomes a parasol, the&nbsp;<i>chattra</i>&nbsp;that was the Sanskrit metaphor for the mushroomic world. The parasol then transforms itself into a bat,&nbsp;<i>le hot volant</i>&nbsp;of French demonic folklore. The bat, in turn, becomes a bellows, one of that family of distensible sacs which we found metaphorically linked with the fungal world in various primitive usages. By a strange chance, a number of these successive designs are emitting a flame, that very flame which with its supernatural and erotic meaning seems to have been at the taproot of Europe's fungal associations. The bellows, indeed, becomes two flaming hearts transfixed by a sword, which in turn give way to a rolling spindle, and then a four-wheeled chariot drawn by flaming steeds in the direction of a starry firmament.</p>

            <p>How strange it is that Grandville in the final emanation of his genius should have struck a chord so nicely attuned to the whole argument of our book! It is as though in his subconscious being this ipth century Frenchman recapitulated the emotions of his race vis-a-vis the fungal world since earliest times, and then gave those emotions expression in a design of breathtaking simplicity and beauty. It is almost as though, with a hundred years of anticipation, he was putting the seal of his subconscious approval on a number of our suggestions.</p>

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b19-fn7">At a time when painting in Scotland was still in its infancy, a cluster of accomplished artists bearing the name of Hamilton were in fashion in central Europe, exponents of the Dutch school. There were James and Frans, whose earliest works seem to date from the i66o's, and James in time gave to the world three sons and one grandson who were painters. James and Frans were presumably kin, but this is an inference unsupported by evidence. It is a fair surmise that they emigrated from Scotland as small children under the Commonwealth, for their schooling in art was wholly Continental. Such biographical data as appear in the reference works about them are meager and dubious.

After carefully examining the picture in London, Professor Lugt wrote us that he failed to see in it the harder, more metallic style of Mignon. Of the signature in the London painting, only 'M' clearly survives, and he interpreted this as the 'M' of 'Melchior d'Hondecoeter'. Afterwards, applying a lens to the area of the signature, we clearly distinguished also the 'd' that precedes the artist's surname. The traditional attribution to Mignon is certainly erroneous, based on a mistaken interpretation of the surviving initial of the name.&nbsp;<a href="#cp5b19-r8">&#8617;</a></li>
