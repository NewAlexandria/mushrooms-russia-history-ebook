  <p class="calibre1">if, as we believe, the hallucinatory mushroom persists even today as a major</p>

  <p class="calibre1">theme in the emotional and religious lives of many of the more withdrawn Indian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peoples of Oaxaca, and if, as we believe, the i6th century writers bear witness</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the important role of the mushroom in the Indian cultures as far north as the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Valley of Mexico and among the Otomi and Tarascan peoples, it is fair to look</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the mushroom also in the archeological evidence of far earlier times. That</p>

  <p class="calibre1">archeologists have not revealed it to us is not necessarily conclusive - they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have not been on the lookout for it. Furthermore, in spite of the spectacular</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discoveries made in Middle America by archeologists in the past, what they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have done until now may some day seem only a beginning by comparison with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the discoveries that he in the future, so many are the major sites that have not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been fully explored or even touched.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is the further question of the role that the mushroom might be expected</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to have played in Middle American art. On this <i class="calibre4">a priori</i> opinions are of little</p>

  <p class="calibre1">value. In Christian art the cross as a symbol is all-pervasive, and it would be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">natural to look for the mushroom in a similar role. If we are right, the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room stones of the early Maya periods in the highlands confirm this analogy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But it does not follow that a major idea always receives corresponding direct</p>

  <p class="calibre1">emphasis in art. Take for example the Host in the Christian world, the Divine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wafer that is the daily reiteration of the Christian's faith in the miracle of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christ's unique mission on earth. The Mass is the very heart of all Christian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">liturgy, and the Mass hangs on the elements of Bread and Wine. By comparison</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with its importance the bread of the Sacrament appears surprisingly seldom in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">religious paintings. In representations of the Last Supper the faces of Christ and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Apostles take priority over the loaf. For more than a thousand years the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">best artistic talent was occupied with representing altars, ecclesiastics habited</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to officiate at Mass, and churches that housed the altar and the Sacrament. All</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of this pictorial eloquence took for granted the central feature, the miracle of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">transubstantiation and the Holy Communion. How seldom, relatively, did the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">artist stop to paint the Host itself! So may it have been with the mushrooms in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pre-Columbian Mexico. We may discover its accidental appearance and at the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same time begin to sense its constructive presence there where it does not appear.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">PLATE LIII. Teopancalco fresco. Teotihuacan, in the Valley of Mexico.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From Teotihuacan III period, A.D. 300-600.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE DIVINE MUSHROOM</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shapes in the border of the famous Teopancalco (or Teopancaxco) fresco in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Teotihuacan. Discovered in 1894, this fresco was carefully copied soon after-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wards by Dr. Antonio Penafiel and Miss Adela Breton.1 Two pre-Columbian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">priests facing each other are engaged in a rite, wearing the vestments of their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">office, their heads burdened with serpent masks. It is supposed that they are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pouring <i class="calibre4">pulque</i> on the ground, and if so the rite is associated with inebriation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and divine possession. In the center, between the two priests, is a motif of inter-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">laced cords, symbol of the mat <i class="calibre4">(petate)</i> that is in its turn a symbol of authority</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Middle America. It is surrounded by a circle of outward pointing triangles,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and this design rests on a ceremonial stand. The border consists of a sequence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of repeated motifs. On the right hand side are three shapes that look mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">roomie, separated from each other by designs that we know represent sea-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shells. The sea-shells are of two kinds, conch and bi-valve.2 The shells and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroomic shapes stem from a stream of water that flows around the outside</p>

  <p class="calibre1">border of the fresco. No Americanist has ever suggested that the mushroomic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discs are mushrooms and at first the idea seems unlikely. The combination of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms with sea-shells is, <i class="calibre4">a priori,</i> disparate. Why should not these discs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be some other sea growth, not yet identified? There seems a further objection</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the mushroomic possibility. The 'stipes' of the 'mushrooms', if we judge by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the sea-shells, are simply streamlets from the mother stream, so that we are left</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with mushroomic discs balanced on the end of these little tributaries. But then</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we remember that the virtue of the hallucinatory mushrooms resides in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pileus or 'head', and the stipe is secondary, and these 'stipes' could serve a dual</p>

  <p class="calibre1">purpose, as stipes and as the umbilical cord through which the life-giving 'blood'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(to use the word of our Zapotec <i class="calibre4">curandero)</i> flows into these 'children of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">waters'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This fresco dates from the period known as Teotihuacan III, extending from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">c. 300 A.D. to 600 A.D. This was a period rich in cultural achievements. There</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is no way to determine what language was then spoken in the Valley of Mexico,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but it could have been an early form of the classical Nahuatl. The archeological</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. See <i class="calibre4">Teotihuacan, Estudio HistSrico y Arqueologico,</i> by Dr. Penafiel, Mexico City, 1900, chap, xm, plates 81 fT.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Eduard Seler's analysis of the fresco will be found in <i class="calibre4">Gesammelte Abhandlungen zur Amerikanischen Sprach-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">und Alterthumskunde,</i> Berlin, 1915, vol. v.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. For an excellent discussion of the role of sea-shells in the culture of the Valley of Mexico, see Hasso von</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"Winning's paper, 'Shell Designs on Teotihuacan Pottery', in <i class="calibre4">El Mexico Antigua,</i> vol. 7, Dec. 1949. Possibly we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover the explanation for the shells in the Valley of Mexico in Wm. E. Safford's paper on the psychogenic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">snuff derived from the plant known as piptadenia peregrina, which is used by the Indians of the Orinoco. Safford</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drew attention to the use of snail shells in conjunction with the snuff, the shells being burned to quicklime whiter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than snow, and then mixed with the <i class="calibre4">yupa,</i> as the natives call their product. See Safford's 'Identity of cohoba,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the narcotic snuff of ancient Haiti', <i class="calibre4">Journal of Washington Academy of Sciences,</i> 1916, pp. 547 ff. Could a similar use</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of lime have been known in Mexico in former times?</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_54">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">excavations of this period in the Valley have produced large numbers of sea-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shells, and whoever the people were, it is clear that in their ceremonials sea-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shells played a conspicuous, if for us undefined, role. In Plate XLI we have il-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lustrated the accessories of the divinatory mushroom rite as it is practiced today</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Mazatec country: these accessories, for one unfamiliar with Middle Ame-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rican anthropology, make up a disparate lot. If we postulate for the Teotihuacan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">period a liturgical use of shells with hallucinatory mushrooms, this border</p>

  <p class="calibre1">becomes intelligible. The fresco itself, according to Seler, invokes the rites of in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ebriation, which is consonant with our hypothesis of hallucinatory mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We examined the Teopancalco fresco in the summer of 1955, and found it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sadly deteriorated but with the surviving portions now well protected. On the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wall of the little room immediately to the right of our fresco, there had once</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been another one of which only a stretch of the border survives in good con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dition, and this border repeats the motif of the one we already know! Mr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Eduardo Noguera has graciously copied it for us, and we publish this design</p>

  <p class="calibre1">here for the first time. Again the mushroomic meaning suggests itself, tempting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but uncertain.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Gordon Ekholm has drawn our attention to the identical pattern of motifs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Tepantitla fresco, dating from the same period and only a mile or so away</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the first. This is an elaborate composition sufficiently well preserved for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its meaning to be analyzed.1 There is a representation of the rain god Tlaloc, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a more aquatic divinity was never portrayed. From his hands drip great drops</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of water, and a stylized river with star fish and shells flows in both directions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the base of the figure. Beyond the big drops of water, on both sides, from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fingers of other hands drop streamlets of water, and from the side of these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">streams nearest to the central figure we discover the same series of shell and disc</p>

  <p class="calibre1">motifs with which we are already familiar. Seeds are scattered on the other side</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of one of these streamlets. Were these seeds mere symbols of fertility, one would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">look for kernels of maize among them. But maize is absent. If our surmise</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about the divine mushrooms is justified, we should expect hallucinatory seeds.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The ones in the fresco are diverse, but among them we discover some that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">forcibly suggest the <i class="calibre4">colorines</i> used with mushrooms for divinatory purposes in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Valley of Mexico to this day. They are red and black, with the hilum,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quite properly, in the red field.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. This has been done with magisterial authority and consummate literary grace by Dr. Alfonso Caso in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">paper entitled 'El Paraiso Terrenal en Teotihuacan', published in <i class="calibre4">Cuadernos Americanos,</i> Nov.-Dec. 1942, Mexico</p>

  <p class="calibre1">City. For an earlier analysis of the role of Tlaloc in the pre-Conquest religion of Middle America, see Eduard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Seler's volume entitled <i class="calibre4">Codex Vaticanus No.</i> 2775, published in German and English in Berlin and London in</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_55">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Tlaloc was one of the most popular and important of Mexican deities. He was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the god of the waters, of the clouds and mist and sleet and hail, of the lightning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bolt, of rain and the streamlets and torrents and rivers and lakes and the ocean.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His home, Tlalocan, was thought to be in the verdant uplands, where the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clouds would gather and water was abundant. How was Tlaloc related to our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms? Look at the curious pattern that emerges from the philological</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence. We know that today, in this Valley of Mexico where the fresco is, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms are called in classic Nahuatl <i class="calibre4">apipiltzin,</i> 'children of the waters', and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this name could have embraced the sea-shells too. The name 'Tlaloc' comes from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Nahuatl root <i class="calibre4">tlal,</i> 'earth', and according to the etymology elaborated by Seler</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the work already cited, the god is 'he who makes things sprout'. "We recall that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Mazatec the word for the hallucinatory mushrooms means 'that which springs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">forth', i. e., 'sprouts' and in Mije we discovered a word for the same mushrooms that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">carries the same meaning. How felicitous are these names, both mycologically and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">psychologically, for the divine mushrooms with delphic powers! The very names</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seem to be translations of'Tlaloc'. When our Zapotec <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> invokes the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Great Lightning Bolt for a larger yield of these mushrooms, is he not invoking</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tlaloc ? With the lightning bolt Tlaloc engenders the divine mushrooms in <i class="calibre4">tlal,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mother earth. We know that one of the emblems of Tlaloc consisted of three</p>

  <p class="calibre1">small conches in a triangular sac. What could be more appropriate, now that we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perceive the context, than hallucinatory mushrooms alternating with sea-shells in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fresco honoring Tlaloc?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The fresco of Tepantitla does not consist solely of the figure of Tlaloc. It was the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mexican belief that the souls of those who drowned went directly to Tlalocan,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where they passed their days disporting themselves on the playing fields of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Paradise. In another panel of the Tepantitla frescos there is a picture of this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Paradise. Dr. Caso has described it in detail and we shall not repeat the description</p>

  <p class="calibre1">here, beyond pointing out that this vision of the Elysian Fields is one of the few</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lovely and gentle expressions of Middle American artistic genius. We ask our-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">selves whether it was not inspired by the visions that the mushrooms of Paradise</p>

  <p class="calibre1">give to those who eat them. There are no mushrooms in this vision, of course, for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the key to Paradise is left behind at the entrance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The panorama in the fresco of which we are speaking is made up of small</p>

  <p class="calibre1">figures scattered across the fields, and it must be read detail by detail, picto-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">graphically. We shall concentrate on a single vignette. In the lower right hand</p>

  <p class="calibre1">corner there is a lake replenishing the river of Tlaloc, and from it there emerges</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the unclothed figure of one who has just died by drowning, the water still</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nostalgia still falling from his eyes, with a branch of luxuriant foliage in his uplifted right hand,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">confidently he advances singing an anthem, which is represented by the five-fold scroll emerging from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his mouth. Above that scroll is the emblem of Tlaloc (the three-fold sea-shell) and a butterfly, which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Middle America (as in European folklore) is frequently the reincarnation of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a defunct soul. In the lake, below the human figure, we are delighted to discover, thrice repeated,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what we will tentatively call the shell-and-mushroom motif. How fitting that the divine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms should have been present when our hero takes leave of this world to enter the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Paradise of Tlaloc!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Seler found that the stylized features of Tlaloc evolved in the beginning from intertwined serpents,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perhaps the very serpents that specialists identify in the headdresses of the priests in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Teopancalco fresco. He also pointed out that the effigies of Tlaloc are often surmounted by a crown</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of triangular peaks, and with some supporting evidence he ventured the suggestion that these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peaks were stylized mountain heights around which the waters of the god would gather. Seler in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his work on the Vatican Codex accompanied his exposition</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the circle of triangular peaks that is an obvious symbol of divinity in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Teopancalco fresco. As others have pointed out, this fresco manifests Maya</p>

  <p class="calibre1">influence. The Teotihuacan III period, contemporary with classic Maya, was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">notable for the cultural interchanges that were taking place between the two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">civilizations. Kidder has shown how the butterfly symbol of the Valley of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mexico at that very time made its appearance in the Highland Maya area.1 In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the light of these circumstances and particularly the notched crowns of Tlaloc,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">how startling it is to look again at the notched aureole of the god emerging</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Borhegyi dating, the Rietberg artifact would be either late pre-classic high-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">land Maya, or early classic. And there is that other mushroom stone, much earlier,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">found at Kaminaljuyu, with the triangular design on the stipe, which we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reproduced on page 279. This last one is early pre-classic, c. 1000 B. c.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The use of the mushrooms distinguished the upland cultures, the very slopes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Tlalocan, the home of Tlaloc, where mushrooms abound. The kinship of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sea-shells with mushrooms, which left us at first nonplussed, now seems nat-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ural. If we were to postulate mushrooms in pre-Conquest art in Mexico,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we would direct our search precisely to frescos dealing with Tlaloc and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Paradise of our mushroomic visions, to the very frescos where we have found</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroomic shapes. The mushrooms here are casual, incidental, like the bread</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE DIVINE MUSHROOM</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stone we may even have hit on a direct link between the mushrooms of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Valley of Mexico and the mushroom stones of the Guatemala highlands.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The little houses where the Tepantitla and Teopancalco frescos survive may</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have been two of many where the devout once gathered to receive and consult</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the divine mushrooms in the sacred purlieus of Teotihuacan. If sea-shells were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">used in the rites, this explains the large numbers still found in those precincts,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">within sight of the great pyramids.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Borhegyi's chart suggests to us that hallucinatory mushrooms were the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">focus of a cult in the highland Maya world that goes back at least to early pre-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">classic times, to B.C. 1000 or earlier, the earliest period when technically such</p>

  <p class="calibre1">artifacts could be carved in stone. Thus tentatively we trace back the use of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">divine mushroom in Middle America to the earliest period from which a record</p>

  <p class="calibre1">could be expected to survive. Beyond that horizon may we project the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room agape back through millennia, to the Eurasian home-land whence our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indians' ancestors migrated?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If the 'mushroom stones' were accessories in a mushroom cult, it is fair to ask</p>

  <p class="calibre1">why that cult disappeared long ago from the Maya highlands. We do not know,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but the social institutions of the Maya world suggest an answer. Let us look</p>

  <p class="calibre1">again at the Mexican evidence. In the remote Mije country we found that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use of the sacred mushrooms was secular. Everyone there knows the mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and gathers and uses them. No <i class="calibre4">curandero</i> is needed for them. In the Mazatec</p>

  <p class="calibre1">country we find a dual cult. There was the superb performance by the Seilora,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sharing the mushrooms with her coven and leading it by song and dance; and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there was an intricate divinatory rite celebrated by Don Aurelio, with the aid of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">divers accessories, according to a complicated liturgical sequence. Don Aristeo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Zapotec country followed the Senora's procedure, but withheld the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Element from his congregation. Do we not discern here, in contemporaneous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">celebrations, the distinct phases of a cult that might mark a chronological evo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lution and in certain circumstances lead to its extinction &gt; The sacred mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with their miraculous powers could have been bathed in <i class="calibre4">mana</i> from an early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">time, and become the exclusive privilege of the priesthood, and ultimately of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the highest priest-kings. As the mushrooms are not habit forming, there was no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">popular addiction to them that would have been an obstacle to this trend. When</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the regime of the priest-kings toppled over, the secret of the mushrooms, like so</p>

  <p class="calibre1">many other secrets of the Maya theocrats, disappeared with them.</p>
