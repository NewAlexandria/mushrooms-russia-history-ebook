    <section class="main">
        <p><span class="initial">N</span>ow our excursion among the mushrooms has ended. Free of professional

  <p class="calibre1">inhibitions, we as amateurs have traveled far and wide, brazenly suggesting novel</p>

  <p class="calibre1">etymologies and theories of our own. Some of these, when put to further test,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are sure to crumble. But our argument is a frontal one, and does not depend on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">single links. Beginning with an addiction to wild mushrooms and keeping our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eye always on them, we have compared the words used for fungi by the various</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indo-European peoples, concentrating on the metaphors that are latent in them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have found a series of semantic themes recurring throughout these fungal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vocabularies, and these themes have suggested origins for many words that have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">heretofore baffled the philologists. If this approach through semantic themes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should prove to have been successful, it could be applied to other specialized</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vocabularies for elementary things and activities that our remotest ancestors must</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have talked about.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We began by asking what lay behind the English word 'toadstool'. In the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">course of our inquiry we discovered several attributes common to wild fungi</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and toads. The peoples of the North Sea basin think of both tribes - fungi and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amphibia - as venomous. Over a broader area and running back deeper into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the past, the peoples of northern Europe think of fungi and toads as organisms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that swell up, and also as dunglike vermin. We find that both toads and fungi</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inspire revulsion and fear, and naturally our ancestors considered them instinct</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with evil spirits. Both are slimy and mucoid. Fungi are tumor-like, clodlike;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and toads are misshapen growths, foul and ugly. Fungi are aphrodisiacs, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toads are lecherous. Both suggest the idea of procreation, in a variety of ways.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On a larger stage, we have found that in the cultures of Europe, where deadly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">serpents are few, the toad is the indigenous equivalent of the serpent of the East.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Eve's serpent, exercising its horrid and fearsome spell, was a creature of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">East. In the eastern Mediterranean the two creatures competed for dominion</p>

  <p class="calibre1">over men's souls, but in the West the toad was supreme. The 'toadstool' of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">West emerges as the mycological and cultural equivalent of the <i class="calibre4">ahi-chattra(ka)</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">or 'snake's parasol' of the Sanskrit writings. A common fund of words for all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these ideas is drawn upon, in the various Indo-European languages, to refer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the fungi, and also to toads, and when in a given language the same or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">similar words are drawn down from the common fund for the two orders of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">creatures, the peoples speaking that language associate toads and fungi to-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gether, and by reason of the words that overlap, and the common attributes,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">VALE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their feelings toward them take on the same tone. Similar metaphorical trans-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fers appear to be indigenous also in human societies far removed from the Indo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">European world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But behind the interweaving of these innumerable words and ideas, there</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lies the Mystery of the divine mushrooms. We have now learned that many spe-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cies of these strange growths possess a power such as early man could only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have regarded as miraculous. Indeed they may have given to him the very</p>

  <p class="calibre1">idea of the miraculous, and inspired many of the themes that come down to us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in our heritage of folklore. Mushrooms were doubly associated with fire. They</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were used as primary tinder in that miracle of divine copulation, the generation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of fire by the fire-drill, and the divine mushrooms were the offspring of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">union of the Lightning Bolt with the Mother Earth. We have suggested that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">divine mushrooms played a vital part in shaking loose early man's imagination,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in arousing his capacity for self-perception, for awe, wonder, and reverence.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They certainly made it easier for him to entertain the idea of God. In Europe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the secret of the mushrooms was lost long ago, but it lingers on, fossilized and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">misunderstood, in our vocabulary, as when the Greeks spoke of mushrooms as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the 'gods' food', the Flemings of 'devils' bread', the demonic <i class="calibre4">crapaudin</i> of France,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the demonic 'toad's stool' of the English, yes and the 'fly' of the German <i class="calibre4">Flie-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">genschwamm.</i> Our legacy of mycophobia, what is it but a simple tabu, the after-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">math of the emotional hold of those mushrooms on our own ancestors?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There were other hallucinogens in the vegetable world, but we think the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms were primary.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Men ordinarily think of words as combinations of sounds that can be visualized</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the aid of letters, and listed alpabetically in dictionaries, and there neatly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">defined and ticketed with their histories. But the words in dictionaries correspond</p>

  <p class="calibre1">only to 'stills' in photography: the dictionaries catch them in a given posture,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at a particular moment in time and space. This is true even of the largest dictio-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">naries, which try to cover meanings over centuries and which cite a few out-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">croppings of the same word in other languages; for the center of gravity even</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in these big dictionaries is still in a single language, and therefore their angle of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vision is self-centered and Ptolemaic. Moreover, no dictionary can hope to deal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with all of the subtle semantic associations, and all the gradations of feeling, that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the sound (which is the word made manifest) evokes. But these associations and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">feelings are the life and soul of the word, of which current usage in a single</p>

  <p class="calibre1">community may be only a passing phase. A word is a thin thread of sound com-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing down to us from earliest human times, a sound passed on from mouth to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mouth, slowly changing, assuming different contours in the mouths of different</p>

  <p class="calibre1">375</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_154"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_77">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">communities, each of these variants remaining a strand of the original thread,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these different strands plaited in and out among themselves, tangling with other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">threads of similar sounds but different meanings; impalpable, visible (through</p>

  <p class="calibre1">writing) only in recent millennia and until yesterday only to a few; thin as air;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but solidly joined in the alembic of the human mind to particular perceptions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the senses and keyed to particular feelings; this link between sound on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one hand, and meaning and feeling on the other, displaying a tough continuity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">down the river of time and across vast stretches of diverse cultural expression,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a continuity that stands in amazing contrast with the airy nothing of the words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">themselves. Words are a secretion peculiar to the human organism, and though</p>

  <p class="calibre1">uttered through a localized vocal mechanism, a secretion attuned to the whole</p>

  <p class="calibre1">organism.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A.E. Housman in his famous Leslie Stephen lecture on the nature of poetry</p>

  <p class="calibre1">startled his public by asserting that for him great poetry was measurable by phy-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">siological reflexes. The shiver down his spine, his beard that bristled at the thought</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of great lines while he was shaving, the catch in his throat, sudden activity in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his lachrymal ducts - these were his poetical touchstones. Could he not have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">carried his idea further ? Was he not fixing his attention only on those rare con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">junctures of grosser reflexes that are the fruit of the greatest utterances? In less</p>

  <p class="calibre1">degree does not every word possess its visceral counterpart, emanating from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pit of the stomach but registering itself in localized manifestations - in the sti-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mulation or inhibition of glandular activity or incipient muscular twitches, in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sights or sounds perceived only by the mind's eye or mind's ear, in imaginary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tactile or olfactory or gustatory sensations ? Teeth are set on edge by sour grapes,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and also by hearing sour grapes mentioned, and even by the silent passage of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">those two words through the attuned mind. Perhaps in the long run the stability</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that is the astonishing property of words is traceable to the solar plexus, to this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">conditioned reflex, which is the obverse side of the audible entity. The great</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speaker or writer - the composer or conductor - is the master who manipu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lates these responses with supreme artistry, playing on the human instruments</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that are his audience, the instruments knowing they are in ecstasy but blissfully</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unaware of the infinitely subtle physiological wherefore. Here is a sense in which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the kingdom of heaven is within us; and the music of the spheres turns out to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be a physiological symphony. Let not this reflection disturb the believer in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Supreme Architect, for the ultimate enigma always remains close by, and man's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">most searching inquiries are always confined within the bounds of the flexible</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but impenetrable envelope of the unknown, of that dark, distensible womb</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that is our prison and our Eden.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">376</p>

  <p class="calibre1">VALE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By assaying the words used among various peoples for the/fungi, we have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perhaps suggested reasons for the mycophobia that afflicts most of the Western</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peoples. The semantic associations of these words, their emotional coloring,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are rooted in the fears and beliefs of our ancestors in the earliest ages, perhaps</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when they were what we call Palaeolithic men. We study them objectively</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by digging up their artifacts and applying the highest order of intelligent cu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">riosity to these old stones. But within ourselves, in our emotional responses, in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our words that come down from long ago, we bear within us as part of us the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence for a subjective understanding of those our forebears. Our elementary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words with their emotional evocation are oral artifacts descended from those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">remote times, and like palimpsests occasionally permit themselves to be read</p>

  <p class="calibre1">layer beneath layer. Our words are a repertory of wood-notes wild, if only we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attune ourselves to the faint descant that rises from them. How amusing it has</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been to discover in mycophobia the willing, nay determined, subservience</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of many Europeans to a simple tabu such as we like to associate with primitive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peoples, a subservience to emotional responses that seem to stem back to the day</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when our ancestors found themselves face to face with the miraculous powers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the sacred mushroom! The secret lost, the tabu survives. Like the tribes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that our anthropologists study, we cling to our own tabus and seek to justify</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them by rationalizing them. Few men want freedom, however they may talk.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But then again perhaps man is free in his choice when he chooses to abide within</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the confines of his unreason.</p>
