            <p><span class="initial">M</span>ycologists sensitive to the fitness of things are the first to admit that their nomenclature for mushrooms offers a spectacle of unscientific confusion, an accumulation of infelicities. Scientific names should be keyed to significant aspects of the organisms that they designate, and there should be uniformity in use. Instead, many of the scientific names for mushrooms serve only to remind us of the errors of early mycologists, and any given species is likely to carry two or more names that are in simultaneous currency in different countries. It even happens that a single scientific name is commonly employed for different kinds! (It seems certain, for example, that two of the famous mushrooms, the amanita muscaria and the amanita phalloides, are different species in Europe from their American namesakes and it is perilous to assume that attributes securely established for them in one continent hold true across the ocean.)</p>

            <p>In formal use, following each name is the surname of the mycologist who described it, or perhaps two such names, and so the objectivity that is the proper virtue of science becomes tinctured with the frailty of those who gladly permit their names to be hitched to a mushroom, perhaps tempted by a vain hope for worldly immortality, if only in union with a fungus.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b20-fn1" id="cp5b20-r1">[1]</a></sup></p>

                <p>Mycological nomenclature got off to a bad start with Carolus Linnæus, the 18<sup>th</sup> century Swedish name-giver. Like <span id="adam-2">Adam</span> he surveyed the living world and bestowed names on all the flora and fauna, but he seems to have hurried a little impatiently over the numerous and baffling and humble fungi. He chose to make use of terms drawn from ancient Greek and Latin, but did not pause to ascertain their rightful meanings. He misapplied almost every one of them. But by the weight of his immense prestige, he stamped the old words with his new meanings, and these are now current the world over. They are current the world over &#8212; save here and there among the peasants of Greece and Italy and France, where vernacular variants of the words used by their ancestors two thousand years ago still circulate with their ancient sense, and hold their own against the new-fangled meanings that prevail in learned circles.</p>

                <p>In extenuation of the Linnæan terminology it can be pleaded that the classical words had already been misused by his precursors, such as Clusius and the Bauhins, and that he merely refined the application of names accepted in scientific circles since the Renaissance. Even if this be true, we may regret that the great Linnæus did not rise to the occasion, and with his papal authority impose a sound system of names conforming to the classical meanings of the words that he was using. There was no difficulty about those classical meanings. Before the century was out, the French mycologist, Jean-Jacques Paulet, in his <i>Traité des Champignons</i> published in Paris in 1793, was discoursing on the nonsense of the official nomenclature and elucidating the classical usage.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b20-fn2" id="cp5b20-r2">[2]</a></sup></p>

                <p>Take the Latin <i>boletus</i>, for example. In imperial Rome this was the name of the superb amanita Cæsarea, that yellow-capped gilled mushroom which was the favorite of emperors and epicures. It was undoubtedly borrowed from the Greek βωλίτης which in turn was derived from βῶλος, meaning a <a name="clod">clod of earth</a>. Mushrooms smell and sometimes look like earthy excrescences, and in <i>boletus</i> we discover another of the basic metaphors used in the fungal world, of which we have already identified many others. The same figure underlies the famous Russian <i>gruzd&#8217;</i>, a derivative of <i>gruda</i>, meaning &#8216;clod&#8217;. The Greek term must have been pejorative, but when fashionable Rome took to mycophagy, <i>boletus</i> acquired an aura of excellence that survives to this day. Cæsar&#8217;s <i>boletus</i> is said to be still called the <i>fongo bolado</i> or <i>bolé</i> around Verona, and <i>boulé</i> in some parts of Provence. <i>Bolet</i> is the general term for fungi, especially those with gills, among the mycophilic Catalans. When the Germans needed a new and favorable word to make mushrooms acceptable on the table, we have seen that they turned <i>boletus</i> into <i>Pilz;</i> and one of the general words for &#8216;mushroom&#8217; in Rumanian is <i>burete</i>, with the same etymology.</p>

                <p>In the light of this history, it is disappointing that Linnæus ratified the severance of that fine old <i>boletus</i> from its ancient moorings, and assigned it to capped mushrooms with a spongy undersurface. The untutored peasants of the Mediterranean lands who still apply the word to gilled mushrooms speak with an authority derived from far older credentials than the mycologists can show, and &#8212; who knows? &#8212; possibly their usage will outlast the new.</p>

                <p>The mushrooms that mycologists call &#8216;boleti&#8217; were the <i>suilli</i> of the Romans, the swine-fungi, a name that comes down to us in modern Italy in the translation <i>porcino</i> (boletus edulis) and <i>porcinello</i> (boletus scaber). The books are wrong when they explain these names by an alleged fondness among pigs for the boleti. These are the species that develop a greasy texture suggestive of pork when cooked in the fresh state; and when dried, they taste like dried meat. This meatiness explains why they are great favorites among the monks of the Russian Church in the long fasts. Today these &#8216;swine-fungi&#8217; are considered <i>kosher</i> among the Jews of Eastern Europe, but our friend Professor Uriel Weinreich, authority on the Ashkenazic culture, reports to us a curious fact. From an informant of Polotsk he learned that in that area the Jews down to modern times have regarded the boletus edulis as <i>treyf</i>, or unclean, and have not eaten it. May not this be a survival of a very old tradition? For the Jews of Russia mostly migrated thither from the West, passing a long stage in Germany on the way, and the association of these mushrooms with the pig in Italy may well have eliminated them from the diet of Jews.</p>

                <p>Reverting now to the mycologists, we find that they have borrowed the Greek word for truffle, ύδνον, to apply to the wholly different hydnaceæ family, and the Greek word for puffball, πέζις, to apply to the wholly different peziza group, and the Greek word for the field mushroom, άμανῖται, to apply to the clan known nowadays as the amanitas. The Latin word for truffle, <i>tuber</i>, alone survives in its original meaning. No purpose was served by these shifts in meaning: they were merely an evidence of bad classical education and an unscientific carelessness with words.</p>

                <p>Another example of this abuse of language is the fate of the Latin word <i>agaricum</i>, the Greek άγαρικόν. Surprising as it may seem, the ancient Romans were not unfamiliar with the fungi of the region that we call Russia. Today &#8216;agaricus&#8217; is the name for the gilled fungi, but it was Linnæus who imposed this meaning. The ancients applied the word to the shelf-fungus that grew on the larch, now known as the femes officinalis, used since ancient times medicinally. Dioscorides explained for us that the name was taken from the land of <span id="agaria">Agaria</span>, lying on the northern shores of what we call the Sea of Azov, there where mariners would steer their course by Point Agarum, halfway between the mouth of the River Don and the ragged peduncle by which the Crimean peninsula hangs from the Continental land-mass. The physicians of Agaria enjoyed renown in those times, and at the Court of Mithridates the Great some of them were always in attendance. Probably the medical school of Agaria was the first to discover the medicinal virtue of the ancient <i>agaricum</i>.</p>

                <p>On the shaky foundation of Linnæus&#8217; basic names for the mushrooms, errors and infelicities have continued to pile up. There is the spring-tide amanita, or amanita verna, which grows in the autumn. There is the amanita phalloides, which ought to be &#8216;phallus-like&#8217;. Not at all! To explain that name we must look at another fungus, most distantly related, which does resemble a phallus and</p>

                <p>which is called the phallus impudicus. Around the base of the stem of the amanita phalloides there grows a &#8216;cup&#8217; that superficially resembles the &#8216;cup&#8217; of the phallus impudicus, and this feature, unrelated to any phallus but shared by the two species, is the trivial justification for the name of the amanita phalloides! There is the gyromitra esculenta, widely sold in the market places of Europe, but whose esculent virtues have been occasionally tarnished by mysterious fatalities. Linnæus himself bestowed on the lactarius deliciosus its misleading name. It seems that reports reached him of the esteem in which a certain lactarius was held in the south of Europe, and he assumed that it was the one with which he was familiar in Sweden, and so bestowed on the kind he knew the name that rightfully belonged to another.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b20-fn3" id="cp5b20-r3">[3]</a></sup> By this blunder he started endless confusion and misunderstanding. The lactarius deliciosus is not delicious, and the species that Linnæus thought he was baptizing is now known as the lactarius sanguifluus, the <i>rovelló</i> of the Catalans, the species on which the Majorcans bestow the delightful name of <i>exclatasangs</i>, or &#8216;<a name="blood-spatterers">blood-spatterers</a>&#8217;. The milk of this kind is reddish, whereas the so-called lactarius deliciosus yields saffron droplets.</p>
                
                <p>One of the greatest of mycologists was Elias Fries, also a Swede. About him there is a story to tell that, so far as we know, has never been told before. Men of learning are sometimes inclined to patronize lesser mortals, but they are themselves subject to occupational hazards of their own, pedantic errors and odd manifestations of ignorance, and Fries offers us an instructive example of the pedantic fallacy.</p>

                <p>It was in 1601, as we have said on an earlier page, that the Frenchman known as Carolus Clusius published his great herbal, <i>Rariorum Plantarum Historia</i>, in which he devoted many pages to descriptions of the fungi of Hungary. Among others, he discussed the species known to the French as the <i>mousseron</i>, and to science as the tricholoma gambosum or tricholoma georgii. We reproduce in facsimile the relevant passage of his text. The reader will observe that Clusius begins by giving the Hungarian and German names of the mushroom, <i>Szent Gyewrgi gambaia</i> and <i>Sant Geörg schwammen</i> respectively. Both names mean the same thing, viz., St. George&#8217;s mushroom, <i>gambaia</i> being the appropriate grammatical form of the Magyar word <i>gamba</i> or <i>gomba</i>, &#8216;mushroom&#8217;, a word borrowed from the Slavs and cousin to the Russian <i>guba</i>.</p>

                <p>More than two centuries later, in 1821, Elias Fries published his <i>Sy&#8217;sterna Mycologicum</i>, one of the classics of mycological writing. In it he bestowed on the species that Clusius had already described the name agaricus gambosus, adding</p>

                <p>the comment that he suspected this was edible because of its odor of fresh flour! (There speaks the mycophobic Swede.) He thought it was the true agaricus georgii, as to which there had been much confusion. Here are Fries&#8217;s words:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    Hunc pro vero A. Georgii, quo nil magis confusum,<br/>
                    et ob odorem farinse recentis edulem suspicor.
                </blockquote>

                <p>Fries did not explain his use of <i>gambosus</i>, but he referred to the very passage in Clusius that we have reproduced, and therefore it was not at all surprising when, in 1827, a learned confrère, Kurt Sprengel, in editing the 16<sup>th</sup> edition of Linnæus&#8217; <i>Systema Vegetabilium</i>, retained the older name, agaricus georgii, and then added, again in Latin, a slighting reference to Fries&#8217;s term, saying that it was derived from the Hungarian word in Clusius and that it was an unhappy choice; which indeed it was.</p>

                <p>In the following year, 1828, Fries gave vent to his pique at this reprimand in his <i>Elenchus Fungorum</i>. Again using Latin, he said that Sprengel, &#8216;most learned in botanical literature&#8217;, was mistaken in tracing the excellent name, agaricus gambosus, to the Hungarian <i>gambaia</i>, which he had never thought nor even heard of. Instead, the nature of the mushroom had inspired him to borrow from the Latin author Vegetius the word <i>gamba</i>!</p>

                <p>This was a most unwise assertion for the great Fries to make. Despite his assertion to the contrary, he was, as his text had expressly said, familiar with Clusius. He had clearly misread Clusius, construing <i>gambaia</i> as a specific name rather than the Magyar word for &#8216;mushroom&#8217;. When challenged, he took refuge in a late Latin writer&#8217;s use of <i>gamba</i>, which in Vegetius, as we have seen, meant a <a name="distension-6">swelling</a> on the hock of a horse. Certainly no one, not even a Swedish mycologist, would associate by first intention the lovely <i>mousseron</i> with a swelling on the hock of a horse! Nor even with a hoof of a horse, which is an alternative meaning. By devising the name &#8216;agaricus gambosus&#8217;, Fries unwittingly was describing the <i>mousseron</i> as of the genus &#8216;agaricus&#8217;, species &#8216;fungus&#8217;.</p>

                <p>By reason of Fries&#8217;s error, the mycologists have inherited, apparently in perpetuity, an absurd scientific name for the simple <i>mousseron</i>, a name that survives in the modern &#8216;tricholoma gambosum&#8217;. If, as we argued on an earlier page, the word <i>gamba</i> in Vegetius was a borrowing from the barbarians of Central and Eastern Europe, then that was the same <i>gamba</i> that appears in Clusius, and Fries did not advance his cause in the slightest by digging up the writings of the Roman veterinary.</p>

                <p>How refreshing it is to turn from the unhappy nomenclature of the mycologists to the genuine words devised over the ages by humble peoples! Some of these hide their secret meanings successfully, such as <i>mízcalo</i> in Spanish, and the generic word for mushrooms in Romany, <i>χuχun</i> or <i>χuχur</i>. To illustrate the complexity of the problems presented by popular mushroom names, we shall cite the case of the delectable mushroom known to science as the tricho-loma equestre, which in the mushroom world holds the rare distinction of growing in sand. It enjoys great renown along the coast of the Landes, in Gascony, under the name <i>bidaou</i>. Some miles to the east, in the sauterne country around Podensac, this same mushroom, highly esteemed, is the <i>pied d&#8217;âne</i>, or ass&#8217;s hoof. In the neighboring region of Entre-deux-mers, famous among wine-lovers, it is the <i>Catalan</i>, a name used elsewhere in the Gironde for the lactarius deliciosus. Beyond the Dordogne around St. Andre de Cubzac, it becomes the <i>jaunisson</i>. Nearby, in the canton of Cavignac, where the <i>langue d&#8217;oil</i> is spoken, our tricholoma equestre is known as the <i>bourseau</i>, from a local word meaning to <a name="distension-7">swell or distend</a>. Thus here in an area of France that could be covered by a pocket handkerchief, so to speak, a single species of mushroom, well known to everyone, bears five distinct names.</p>

                <p>Wherever the latent metaphor in a popular name for a mushroom can be deciphered, it is invariably accurate in observation and true in feeling. In the course of these pages we have uncovered many of these inner meanings, but there has been no occasion to refer to some of the best. Take the curious case of the cantharellus cibarius. No one has discovered the name for it in ancient times, but since it carries today more names by far than any other wild mushroom of Europe, we must suppose that it was known to our remote ancestors also. In most of the Slavic countries its name is keyed to the <a name="fox-2">fox</a>, e. g., the Russian <i>lisichki</i>, &#8216;little foxes&#8217;, and the Hungarians translated this to arrive at their <i>roka-gomba</i>. The Lithuanian <i>lapelaižis</i> means the &#8216;fox-licked one&#8217;: foxes like squirrels are great mycophages. In Old Czech of the 14<sup>th</sup> century we find the term <i>lišči húba</i>, &#8216;fox&#8217;s mushroom&#8217;. The Bulgarians use an expression that is wholly their own, <i>pachi kraka</i>, the &#8216;duck&#8217;s foot&#8217;, a happy figure of speech, as will be perceived by any mycophile who recalls the color and shape of the webbed foot of a duck, idly suspended in air or water.</p>

                <p>The German <i>Pfifferling</i> or &#8216;<a name="pepper-2">peppery</a> one&#8217; is an inappropriate changeling. This name rightly belonged to the lactarius piperatus, as we can prove by the description of it given in the <i>Adnotationes</i> of Valerius Cordus in the 1530&#8217;s:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Sunt enim quidam Piperis sapore et lacteo liquore manant. Hos German! <i>Pffferlinge</i> vocant.</p>
                    <p>For there are some with the taste of pepper, and they flow with a milky fluid. These the Germans call <i>Pfifferlinge</i>.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Two centuries earlier Konrad von Megenberg in his <i>Das Buch der Natur</i> also speaks of the <i>Pfifferling</i>, which he says is of questionable edibility. It seems that when the Germans began to take to mycophagy, they appropriated an existing name of another mushroom to apply to the cantharellus cibarius, a small mushroom that all true mycophiles hold in modest esteem; wherefore in time the German name acquired a secondary meaning, to designate anything trivial, and in this sense the German word turns up in French in a single expression: cela ne vaut pas un fifrelin.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b20-fn4" id="cp5b20-r4">[4]</a></sup> In Austria our little chanterelle is the <i>Eierschwamm</i>, suggestive of the scrambled eggs that these mushrooms resemble and with which in Austria they are often prepared.</p>

                <p>Of the many names for the cantharellus cibarius in France, the <i>girolle</i> and the <i>chanterelle</i> are the most widely known. The French philologists Oscar Bloch and Albert Dauzat both assert that <i>chanterelle</i> entered the French language in the middle of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, and that it was taken from the scientific name bestowed on the mushroom by Linnæus &#8212;&#8203; &#8216;cantharellus&#8217; &#8212; which in turn (according to the French philologists) he devised from a Latin word <i>cantharella</i>, a little cup. This etymology is <i>prima facie</i> suspect, for popular names bestowed on mushrooms by French peasants are not normally derived from learned terms of Linnaean inspiration. In fact, the philologists are mistaken. Jean Bauhin in his great <i>Historia Plantarum Universalis</i>, published in 1650-1 and written a half century earlier, reported that <i>chanterelle</i> was in his time the popular name of the mushroom around Montbeliard, in the east of France. Clearly the mycologists Latinized the word as they found it. <i>Chanterelle</i> is a name of popular inspiration descended from the Latin diminutive <i>cantharulus</i>, formed from <i>cantharus</i>, which in turn was borrowed from the Greek κάνθάρος, drinking cup. Possibly there is collateral evidence of this origin in a word that survives in the archaic Spanish spoken in Jocotan, Guatemala &#8212; <i>canturula</i>, the name of an ear-shaped fungus that grows on old trees.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b20-fn5" id="cp5b20-r5">[5]</a></sup> Words that circulate chiefly on the tongues of humble people undergo subtle pressures and transformations, being re-shaped to conform to punning suggestions and metaphorical associations. Perhaps there is evidence of this in <i>chanterelle</i>. This little mushroom in Italian is the <i>gallinaccio</i>, &#8216;turkey-cock&#8217;. In Dutch it is the <i>hanekarn</i>, &#8216;<a name="cocks-comb-2">cock&#8217;s comb</a>&#8217;, though Dutchmen, being mostly mycophobes, often know not the word in this sense. The Dutch and Italian words suggest the masculinity of the <a name="cock-1">cock</a>. In Catalan the chanterelle is the <i>rossinyol:</i> this is said to be derived from <i>ros</i>, <i>rossa</i>, an adjective that describes to a nicety the red-gold color of the lovely mushroom. But <i>rossinyol</i> also means &#8216;nightingale&#8217;, and it happens that, just as the dove or <i>paloma</i> is the symbol of the beloved in French and Spanish popular tradition, the nightingale is the symbol of the lover.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b20-fn6" id="cp5b20-r6">[6]</a></sup> In Bulgaria, as we have seen, the chanterelle is linked with the drake. These ornithological ties, always masculine, are curious. Does not <i>chanterelle</i> itself suggest singing and <i>chantecler?</i> Are we not in the presence of an eruption, subtle and unconscious, of the old <a name="erotic-6">erotic theme</a>, by way of the cock&#8217;s comb, the gobbler&#8217;s wattles, the crowing chanticleer, the virile <i>rossinyol</i>?&#160;If our surmise be right, confirmation must be sought, not in the sophisticated ratiocinations of scholars, but rather in the emotional associations of the untutored folk when they use their homely words for the little yellow mushroom. If our surmise be right, the deep-seated eroticism of the fungal consciousness of Europe is erupting again, before our eyes, in the words born of popular fancy or reshaped by popular pressure to designate the cantharellus cibarius. Like murder, the shameless μύκης will out. Our straws of evidence permit us to discern the erotic theme as through a glass, darkly. How pleasing it is for us, then, our surmise having been formulated, to discover corroboration for it in eastern Europe. In the Latvian language the name of the cantharellus cibarius <i>isgailene</i>, derived immediately from <i>gailis</i>, &#8217;<a name="cock-2">cock</a>&#8217;, a word that is kin to the Latin <i>gallus</i>.</p>

                <p>The alternative word in French for the chanterelle is <i>girolle</i>. French philologists seem satisfied that this word shares the same root as &#8216;gyrate&#8217;, but there is no evidence for this. <i>Girolle</i> is a borrowing from Provençal, where the name is current in many variations extending over the langue d&#8217;oc area of France and throughout Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. <i>Jírgola</i> in Majorca corresponds to <i>girbola</i> in Catalan, and in Frederic Mistral&#8217;s Provençal dictionary we find the word in myriad forms. No other mushroom anywhere seems to possess so many names, of which here are the ones we have collected:</p>

                <p>Here we leave an enigma for ethno-mycologists to apply themselves to &#8212; in an area unsurpassed for mycophagy, an important mushroom parades an unrivalled diversity of interrelated popular names, all of unknown meaning and all reduced in French to the lovely but deceptively simple <i>girolle</i>.</p>

                <p>So much for the chanterelles. In Swiss German the clavaria or coral mushroom is known as the <i>Ziegenbart</i>, or <a name="goats-beard">goat&#8217;s beard</a>, which is a good metaphor, but it is topped, we think, by the happiest name in all of Europe&#8217;s mushroom vocabulary, the Catalan word for the same fungus, which is <i>peus de rata</i>, or <a name="rats-paw">rat&#8217;s paws</a>. The soft, marvelously fine articulation of the paws of a rat are the perfect analogy for the corresponding extremities of the coral mushroom, and in this mushroomic name we possess a supreme example of the perception of peasants.</p>

                <p>Sometimes the mycologists have paid obeisance to popular terminology. For example, the name of the puffball, lycoperdon, is a learned back-formation to a non-existent Greek term that would mean &#8216;wolf&#8217;s flatus&#8217;. How much better it would have been to use the genuine Greek name for the same fungus, πέζις, which harbors the same indelicate idea!</p>

                <p>It might be thought that the mycologists of the world, being a relatively small group, could agree together to wipe the slate clean and begin anew, giving no hostages to vested interests, and devise a system of solidly grounded mushroomic names. But such reforms seem beyond the capacity of men, even scientists, and perhaps this is just as well. A nomenclature that is encumbered with barbarisms, pedantic fallacies, and infelicities is a perpetual and humbling reminder that scientists themselves are ordinary clay, even when they are cultivating their own garden.</p>

Juan Corominas in his note on the Spanish <i>seta</i> points out that it has carried the same metaphoric meaning.&#160;<a href="#cp5b20-r4">&#8617;</a></li>
