  <p class="calibre1">In Europe the amanita muscaria is one of the most widely known of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wild mushrooms. It is the archetype for the 'toadstool' tribe in mycophobic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">countries, being the first gilled mushroom that the mycophobe learns to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">recognize, that he may the better curse it. In mycophagic lands all country</p>

  <p class="calibre1">folk know it, and have devised for it a diverse popular nomenclature. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">esteem in which the various edible species are held differs in different parts of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Europe, but the obloquy meted out to the fly amanita is uniform and heavy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Its evil reputation far outruns its deserts. There is a general belief that the victim</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who eats it dies; yet we believe that this murderous accusation is unsupported</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by a single trustworthy case history. How strange it is that the fly amanita should</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be far better known than its truly lethal cousins, which in some parts of Europe,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">such as Great Russia, possess no common name!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A mushroom that is merely lethal is less interesting than one possessed of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">devil. Here lies, we believe, the explanation for the singular reputation of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amanita muscaria. This mushroom inebriates, it does not kill, and in all primitive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">societies inebriation, like delirium and even insanity, is held in awe as a mani-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">festation of divine powers. The problem of the amanita muscaria is one of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">most elusive that ethno-mycology has to offer, and one of the most fascinating.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Can we show that its intoxicating virtue was known to our remote ancestors</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and that they made use of it? Did it play the role of an important hallucinogen</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the early social history of Europe ? For almost two centuries the slow debate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has gone on, and the issue is still moot. Perhaps it is possible to adduce fresh</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence, but first we shall sum up the discussion to date.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the early i8th century, the Swedish traveler Philip Johan von Strahlenberg</p>

  <p class="calibre1">journeyed extensively in Russia, Tartary, and Siberia. His admirable report,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">written in German, appeared first in Stockholm in 1730, and an English trans-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lation came out in London in 1736, bearing the lengthy title:&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">An Historical and</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Geographical Description of the North and Eastern Parts of Europe and Asia parti-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">cularly of Russia, Siberia, and Tartary.</i>&nbsp;Von Strahlenberg was a thorough and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">conscientious observer. From his pages the western world learned for the first</p>

  <p class="calibre1">time of the Korjak tribesmen of Kamchatka, and how they consumed the fly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amanita for its intoxicating effect. This nugget of curious anthropological</p>

  <p class="calibre1">information drew wide attention throughout the literate world, and the interest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then aroused has continued up to now. Indeed, a bibliography dealing with this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Korjak practice would be surprisingly long. Today we know that traces of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">190</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE FLIES IN THE AMANITA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it survive also among the neighboring communities of Kamchadals, and also</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among the Chukchees, the primitive people living in sparse and tiny villages at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the easternmost tip of Siberia, across the Bering Strait from Alaska.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indeed, we know more. Far to the west of the Korjaks and Chukchees, in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">western Siberia, in the northern lands lying between the Ob and Yenisei rivers,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we have fragmentary but reliable reports that the shamanistic use of the inebriat-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing fly amanita has survived into our own times. Kai Donner, the Finnish scholar,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">states that the Samoyeds in this region eat the mushroom, and also the people</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known as the Yenisei-Ostjaks.1 The Samoyeds are not of the Finno-Ugrian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">culture, but the Samoyeds and Finno-Ugrians together make up the family of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peoples known as Uralic. The Yenisei-Ostjaks, though neighbors, are of dif-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ferent cultural lineage, being one of those now scattered tribes, inhabiting the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">most inhospitable and remote corners of Siberia, grouped together for con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">venience by anthropologists as 'Hyperborean' or 'Paleo-Siberian'. Donner re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ports that the shamans of the Yenisei-Ostjaks, to achieve the desired psychic ef-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fect, eat seven mushrooms, for which their name is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">hanggo,</b></i>&nbsp;a word clearly re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lated to the Latin&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">fungus</i>&nbsp;like the other variants mentioned on pages ijSff.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Well to the east of the Yenisei-Ostjaks, east of the Lena River, but to the west of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Chukchees and Korjaks, there is another Paleo-Siberian people, the Yuka-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ghirs. According to Jochelson in his study of this people, made two generations</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ago, they no longer used the fly amanita in his time but they preserved a tradi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion of its use in earlier days. Jochelson unfortunately failed to note the Yukaghir</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name for it, nor did he record the details of the tradition.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">More than two centuries have passed since von Strahlenberg published his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">book, and for the role of the fly amanita as an inebriant in Siberia we still</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must rely on stray data that anthropologists have happened to catch. A desidera-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tum for Russian and Finnish workers should be an intensive ethno-mycological</p>

  <p class="calibre1">survey of all the peoples of Siberia, to discover every trace of the inebriating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom. In folklore, in linguistics, and in the details of contemporary usage,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there must be much evidence concerning it that we now ignore. If we assume,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as some anthropologists have done, that the Paleo-Siberian peoples (Korjaks,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Kamchadals, Chukchees, Yukaghirs, Yenisei-Ostjaks, etc.) once roamed over</p>

  <p class="calibre1">most of northern Siberia, and that they were then sent scattering to their present</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. See Donner's&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Bei den Samojeden in Sibirien,</i>&nbsp;Stuttgart, 1926, p. no; also his 'Ethnological Notes about the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yenisey Ostjak (in the Turukhansk region)', published in the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Memoires de la Societe Finno-ougrimne,</i>&nbsp;vol. LXVI,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Helsinki, 1933, pp. 81-82. The former study has been translated and published (New Haven, 1954) with the title</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Among the Samoyed in Siberia,</i>&nbsp;in the series of Behavior Science Translations, Human Relations Area Files. With</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that disregard for precision in matters mushroomic which afflicts most Anglo-Saxon work, the translator ren-</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">peripheral habitats by irrupting Mongol and Turkic invaders from the south,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then the use among them of a common Indo-European word for the fly amanita</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would certainly date back to the time before they were blown to the four cor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ners. The specific application to the fly amanita by certain of these vestigial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peoples of a word that in Indo-European is generic for all mushrooms poses an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">exciting question: did these Siberian tribesmen borrow the use of the inebri-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ating mushroom, and with it the name, from the Indo-Europeans &gt;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Before the i8th century was out, in 1784, von Strahlenberg's compatriot, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scientist Samuel Odman, advanced the thesis that 'going berserk' in early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Norse times had been a state of excitement produced by the fly amanita.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Odman suggestion was taken up and elaborated more than a century</p>

  <p class="calibre1">later, in 1886, by the Norwegian botanist Fredrik Christian Schiibeler in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Viridarium Norvegicum I.</i> The Odman-Schiibeler theory took popular hold in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">parts of Scandinavia and even gained acceptance there among writers of scientific</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and popular handbooks, school textbooks, and encyclopaedias. Indeed, many</p>

  <p class="calibre1">educated Swedes and Norwegians seem to take the theory as accepted fact.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In 1929, a specialist in the medical history of Norway, Dr. Fredrik Gron,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">undertook to challenge Odman and Schiibeler.2 He dismissed the fly-amanita</p>

  <p class="calibre1">explanation for 'berserk-raging' as weakly founded and improbable, pointing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out that nowhere in sagas or other early Nordic source is there a reference to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fly amanita. In this he has been recently sustained by Professor Magnus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Olsen, the outstanding authority today on Norse literature and traditions.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Furthermore, the ancient writings of the Mediterranean basin make no allusion</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to fungal hallucinogens nor is there a single mention of inebriating mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the voluminous source materials available to us concerning the witchcraft</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cult. Odman and Schiibeler had relied solely on the analogy of modern practices</p>

  <p class="calibre1">observed among the Siberian tribes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But their side of the argument has not lacked champions. On November i,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1918, the famous Swedish meteorologist H. Hildebrandsson read a paper before</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Royal Scientific Society in Upsala in which he recounted an extraordinary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">episode. It seems that in the war between Sweden and Norway in 1814, some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">soldiers of the Swedish Varmland regiment were observed by their officer to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be seized by a raging madness, foaming at the mouth. On inquiry, it was learned</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. His paper was entitled 'Forsok at utur Naturens Historia forklara de nordiska gamla Kampars Berserka-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">garig' ('An attempt to explain the berserk-raging of ancient Nordic warriors through natural history'), published</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by the Kungliga Vetenskaps Akademien, Nya Handlingar, vol. 5, pp. 240 et seq. For all of our references to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Scandinavian pronouncements on the fly amanita we are indebted to Professors Georg Morgenstierne and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Rolf Nordhagen.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the soldiers had eaten of the fly amanita, to whip up their courage to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fighting pitch. We have not seen the Hildebrandsson paper, nor discovered the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence contemporary with the alleged episode on which he relied, but both</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he and the society before which he appeared enjoy the highest standing in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scientific circles, and his paper was quoted by Professor Carl Th. Morner, a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">distinguished Swedish physiologist, whose avocation was the study of botany</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the higher fungi, in two of his publications on mushrooms.1 The Odman-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Schiibeler thesis received further endorsement from Professor Rolf Nordhagen,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Norwegian botanist, in an article in the Norwegian newspaper <i class="calibre4">Aftenposten</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">of January n, 1930.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is a tradition in Russia that the fly amanita was once used in folk medi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cine. N. Annenkov refers to this former usage as a fact in his <i class="calibre4">Botanicheskii</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Slovar',</i> published in St. Petersburg in 1878. Rudolph Krebel in his <i class="calibre4">Volksmedicin</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">und Volksmittel verschiedener Volkerstamme Russlands,</i> published in 1858, said that it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had been used to treat lameness, but he is not precise in citing his authority nor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in identifying the practice with a particular place or period. In some kinds of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">arthritis the exertions stimulated by the fly amanita might indeed be helpful.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps there exist earlier treatises on Slavic folk medicine that will amplify</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these insufficient hints. In Professor C. Hartwich's great work, <i class="calibre4">Die menschlichen</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Genussmittel,</i> published in Leipzig in 1911, we find on page 256 a sentence which,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">translated, says: "In a letter from a native of Zurich in 1799, in which year</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a Russian army under Korsakov was stationed there, the amazing statement was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">made that the Russians gathered and ate fly amanitas on the Ziirichberg. Of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">course, the Russians must have learned to do this in their own country." The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pharmacologist Emil Eidenbenz of Zurich has gone to considerable pains for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us in looking for the letter on which Professor Hartwich relied, but with no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">success. Thus a promising hint, on inquiry, yields meager results.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our European ancestors had opportunities to witness the inebriation caused</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by the fly amanita, it only when accidents occurred. There are numerous medical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">case histories of such episodes. One of the best is to be found in a paper by Dr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">M. Roch, a physician attached to the Cantonal Hospital in Geneva, entitled</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Les Empoisonnements par les champignons', published in the <i class="calibre4">Bulletin</i> of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Societe Botanique de Geneve, 2nd series, 1913, where he reports on the wild</p>

  <p class="calibre1">delirium of four Italian laborers in the Canton of Neuchatel after they had eaten</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a mess of fly amanitas. The delirium was followed by sleep, and sleep by a return</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to normal sobriety. Such episodes must have occurred from earliest times, and</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_85">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">must have aroused the awe that the astonishing symptoms would naturally</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inspire among people whose lives were shaped by beliefs in supernatural forces.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But in the early treatises on mushrooms, before von Strahlenberg's journey into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Siberia, we find no intoxicating properties attributed to the amanita muscaria.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It seems clear that cooking attenuates or kills the distinctive virtue of the fly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amanita. In Italy and France it is not rare to find individuals who habitually eat</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this mushroom with impunity. Our friend Camille Fauvel, the mightiest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophage of us all, informs us that he has sat down to a mess of fly amanitas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scores of times. He gathers the mushrooms, peels the caps, discards the stems,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and cooks the peeled caps in any of the usual ways. Holger Lundbergh of New</p>

  <p class="calibre1">York reports to us that his mother in Sweden was taught by the famous painter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Anna Boberg, nee Scholander, to add a snippet of the cap of a fly amanita</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in preparing all mushroom dishes, in order to point up the flavor. Whence came</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this astonishing culinary secret, uncovered thus in the heart of mycophobic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sweden? Mrs. Boberg can hardly have hit on it herself. Did she pick it up</p>

  <p class="calibre1">elsewhere in Europe? Or was it indigenous to Sweden, the final emanation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of some ancient esoteric lore, possibly distorted beyond recognition from its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">original purpose and aspect?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the best accounts of the symptoms of fly-amanita inebriation, we turn</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the observations of Waldemar Bogoras and Waldemar Jochelson during</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their visits to Kamchatka a generation ago. (Their studies were published by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">American Museum of Natural History as parts of the memoirs of the Jesup</p>

  <p class="calibre1">North Pacific Expedition.) On eating the mushrooms a period of exaltation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ensues, in which the chewers of the raw mushrooms shout and rage. Then they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">engage in feats of prodigious physical exertion and experience illusions of radical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">changes in all dimensions, of miraculous mobility, of metamorphosis. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">folklore of northern Europe is filled with supernatural phenomena that remind</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us of these symptoms, as for example the powers of mobility attributed to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">witches and werewolves. But are mushrooms ever mentioned in those tales?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of themselves, these analogies from folklore carry no weight, and indeed we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must be cautious about false clues. Take for example the strange case of Alice</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Wonderland. Shortly after her adventures begin, this enchanting child</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nibbles at a mushroom, and it produces in her the typical sense of changed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dimensions that we recall in the horrifying accounts of the amanita-eating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Korjaks. All of Alice's subsequent distortions, softened by the loving irony of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lewis Carroll's imagination, retain the flavor of mushroomic hallucinations. Is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there not something uncanny about the injection of this mushroom into Alice's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">story ? What led the quiet Oxford don to hit on a device so felicitous, but at the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">194</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE FLIES IN THE AMANITA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same time sinister for the initiated readers, when he launched his maiden on her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">way &gt; Did he dredge up this curious specimen of wondrous and even fearsome</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lore from some deep well of half-conscious folk-knowledge ? On first reflection</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that mushroom in <i class="calibre4">Alice,</i> so innocent for the uninformed, seems like a gentle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">aftermath, a distant reminder, of awful rumblings from barbaric times now</p>

  <p class="calibre1">forgotten; like the long, harmless swell that rocks the sea many days after the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">havoc of the hurricane. The temptation is strong to espouse this romantic hy-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pothesis, and for the purposes of the controversy among Scandinavian scholars,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this would tilt the balance, and the ayes would have it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But we think that Alice's mushroom grew in Kamchatka, not in the forests</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of primeval Europe. It was on July 4, 1862, while rowing gently up the Isis to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Godstow, that Lewis Carroll embarked on Alice's adventures, holding three</p>

  <p class="calibre1">little maidens spellbound by the tale. Over the following months he put the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">story into final form, and presented the completed manuscript to Alice for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christmas in the same year. Now it so happens that the earliest popular manual</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on mushrooms in the English language made its appearance in that same year,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">M. C. Cooke's <i class="calibre4">A Plain and Easy Account oj British Fungi.</i> We do not know</p>

  <p class="calibre1">exactly when it came on the market, but we know that it was the subject of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lengthy review in the October 4 issue of <i class="calibre4">The Gardeners Chronicle and Agri-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">cultural Gazette.</i> (The reviewer commended Cooke's efforts, and then conceded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the hopeless mycophobia of the English: "... notwithstanding all that is said</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in favour of mushrooms, we suspect it will take a long time to remove the deep</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooted prejudice that exists against them in this country, and teach our rustic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">population those that are harmless.") Cooke's little volume describing strange</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungal growths was of a kind to attract Alice's creator. On pages 20-21 Cooke</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discusses the use to which the fly amanita is put by the Korjaks, and its effects</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the eater: "The natural inclinations of the individual become stimulated.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The dancer executes a <i class="calibre4">pas d'extravagance,</i> the musician indulges in a song, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chatterer divulges all his secrets, the orator delivers himself of a philippic, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mimic indulges in caricature. <i class="calibre4">Erroneous impressions of size and distance are</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">common occurrences,</i> a straw lying in the road becomes a formidable object, to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">overcome which a leap is taken sufficient to clear a barrel of ale or the prostrate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">trunk of a British oak." (The italics are ours; the reader will note the Gil-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bertian flavor of the oak that had to be 'British'.) In Lewis Carroll's diaries we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">learn that he began putting Alice's adventures on paper on November 13,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">well after Cooke's volume was on the market. For more than four months his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tale had been taking shape in his mind, a period when he must have been ripe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for such suggestions as Cooke had to offer.</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_181"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_86">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">With a shout of discovery we leap to the conclusion that Alice's mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is the one that Cooke serves us. The timing is perfect. Surely the progenitor of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alice, in the cloistered retreat of Christ Church, with Cooke's manual at hand,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">transmuted the untamed practices of the uncivilized Korjaks into the poetry of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wonderland.1 But no sooner do we reach this presumption than doubt re-enters,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">raising an admonitory finger. Can we be sure there was no native memory of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">miracle-working mushroom ? We turn to the English translation of Jacob</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Grimm's <i class="calibre4">Teutonic Mythology,</i> and there in volume 4, on page 1412, we find the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">following statement, based on an Irish fairy-tale that we have not succeeded in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">locating: "The Elf-King sits under a great toadstool, and whoever carries a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toadstool about him grows small and light as an elf." Certainly Lewis Carroll</p>

  <p class="calibre1">never read this reference in Grimm, but Grimm's wonder-working fungus of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Irish lineage long antedated Cooke and von Strahlenberg, and Alice on her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">journey may have encountered this native mushroom. Once again our inquiries</p>

  <p class="calibre1">leave us poised between yes and no.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If on balance we incline to the view that Cooke inspired the mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">episode in <i class="calibre4">Alice,</i> this is because Cooke's influence is clearly felt in Charles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Kingsley's famous novel, <i class="calibre4">Hereward, the Last oj the English,</i> published in 1866.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Chapter 10 Kingsley introduces to his readers an old Lappish nurse, living in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">England, who possessed the secret of the "scarlet toadstools". She adds their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">juice to the men's ale, and makes them laugh and roar, "merry-mad everyone of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them", and thus she extracts from them their secrets. Kingsley in the story</p>

  <p class="calibre1">expressly denies that the English of pre-Conquest times knew the virtues of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"strange fungus, with which Lapps and Samoiedes have, it is said, practised</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wonders for centuries past". In any case, the historical novelist is not an his-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">torical source. He too had read his Cooke, or some other of the earlier writers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about the Korjaks, and to adorn his plot he fathered on the Lapps the practices</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Siberian tribes remote from them and remoter still from England.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But today we know that he was right about the Samoyeds. Will some persistent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inquirer someday discover that the Lapps knew the secret too ?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the annals of Europe's cultural history it is hard to find a parallel for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">polemic over the fly amanita's role in the Viking world. Odman published the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">initial paper in 1784, and at a glacial pace the controversy has simmered since</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then in Scandinavia and nowhere else. In English and German mycological</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. We cannot prove that M. C. Cooke's book was in C. L. Dodgson's possession. We learn from W. G. Hiscock,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">assistant librarian of Christ Church, Oxford, that Dodgson's library was dispersed after his death, and in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">auction sale many books were put up in lots with only one or two titles itemized in the catalogue.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE FLIES IN THE AMANITA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">writings one sometimes happens on allusions to it, but only allusions. Yet for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the ethno-mycologist and the student of northern Europe's early culture the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">problem will not stay laid, so long as the meager and tantalizing evidence hangs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">balanced as it does today.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We believe a new approach to the enigma of the fly amanita is to be found</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the history of word meanings. We intend to propose a novel reason for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">link that binds the famous mushroom with the fly. This is a bold undertaking,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the traditional explanation, the official and orthodox explanation, has seemed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to everyone for centuries to be full, perfect, and sufficient. Indeed, the argument</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in favour of orthodoxy in this instance is so strong that if we should succeed in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our challenge, our triumph in this our secluded garden of intellectual disputation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would be high drama, even if only in a minor key: caviar for initiates.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Everyone who knows the first thing about wild mushrooms knows why the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fly amanita is so called: it kills the flies that feed on it and until modern times it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was used as a household insecticide on the Continent. This is what all the books</p>

  <p class="calibre1">say. What is more, there is a large part of Europe where the untutored rustics,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the people who read no books, also accept the story as part of their legacy of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">folk knowledge. It belongs to that curious fund of 'facts' that people keep</p>

  <p class="calibre1">repeating to each other and believing, without verification or analysis, like the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">saying that all Russians are good linguists. The area of Europe where our folk</p>

  <p class="calibre1">belief prevails is extensive but not all-inclusive. It embraces the Slavic world,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Germanic world except the British Isles, the Vosges, where Franco-German</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bilingualism prevails, and one or two enclaves elsewhere in France. The ancient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">authors, though they have much to say about the fungi, never refer to a fly-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">killer, and in modern Italy among the country folk we believe the association</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the fly is unknown, but ouf inquiry has not been exhaustive. It is unknown</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among the Basques, and apparently to all the rural population of the Iberian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peninsula. If we judge by Eugene Rolland's evidence in his <i class="calibre4">Flore Populaire,</i> in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">France the name <i class="calibre4">tue-mouche,</i> 'kill-fly', is indigenous only in Alsace and the Aude,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">though thanks to the mushroom manuals, it is now familiar to a sprinkling</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of educated Frenchmen elsewhere. (Rolland reports that at Val-d'Ajol in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vosges the natives hang the fly amanita from the ceiling, where, he says, it draws</p>

  <p class="calibre1">flies to their death.) By contrast the German <i class="calibre4">Fliegenschwamm</i> or 'fly-fungus'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has its variants in all the German dialects, and also in Dutch and the Germanic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">languages of Scandinavia, but not in English. (The 'fly agaric' and 'fly amanita'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of England are learned inventions of the past two centuries.) The Russians say</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">mukhomor</i> or 'fly-killer', and parallel terms are found on the tongues of other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peoples of the Slavic family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In short, the fly amanita is linked with the fly almost solely among the Ger-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">manic and Slavic peoples of northern Europe. We can trace it back six centuries,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in a series of quotations we are going to document this folk belief from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Middle Ages down to the Age of Science. We shall prove that its credentials</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have been seasoned with time. We shall suggest that what has long been believed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">may be only part of the truth, or even wholly false.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The earliest reference to the fly amanita known to us is in <i class="calibre4">De Vegetabilibus,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the considerable work on the vegetable kingdom written in the I3th century</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by Albertus Magnus. Twice he speaks of it and on each occasion refers to its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fly-killing powers:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[i]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tuber enim, quod vocatur muscarum, venenosum est; et si lacti immisceatur, et muscas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the mushroom that is called flies' [mushroom] is poisonous; and if it be mixed with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">milk, and flies fall upon that milk, upon tasting it they swell up and die. Moreover, that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom is broad, and tends to redness, having on the surface vesicles, such as are the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vesicles on the skin of a very leprous man, in which not moisture, but a certain windiness</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is enclosed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre5">[2]</b></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Among our dwellings, moreover, there is found a fungus that is wide and thick, having</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a little ruddiness on its surface; and in that ruddiness it has many raised vesicles, of which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">some are broken, some not; and that [fungus] is death-dealing, and kills immediately, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is called flies' fungus for this reason, that when pulverized in milk it kills flies.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The quotations are taken from pages 136 and 517 of the text edited by Carl</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jessen and published in Berlin in 1867.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A century later, in the years 1349-50, another German, Konrad von Megen-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">berg, wrote <i class="calibre4">Das Buck der Natur,</i> the earliest work on natural science in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">German language. He devotes a paragraph to various fungi, and ends up with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">some quaint sentences about the amanita muscaria. Writing in the Bavaro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Austrian dialect, he said:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Es ist auch einer anderley schwammen die seind zuomal unreyn die seind breit und</p>

  <p class="calibre1">198</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is also another kind of fungi which is wholly unclean; they are broad and on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">top red with white little plaques. When one mixes them with milk, they kill flies.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Therefore are they called <i class="calibre4">muggennschwammen</i> [i.e., 'fly-fungi'] and in Latin <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">mustineti[?].</b></i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have taken our text from the earliest printed edition, dated 1475.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our third author is likewise German, Valerius Cordus, known sometimes as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the father of modern pharmacology, whose untimely death at the age of 29</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the year 1544 was considered by his Renaissance contemporaries, the scholars</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the New Learning, as the crudest of blows and an irreparable loss. In his</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Adnotationes</i> or commentaries on Dioscorides he too devotes one paragraph</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to mushrooms, and one sentence to the fly amanita. In his text we find the earliest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use known to us of the modern German name <i class="calibre4">Fliegenschwamm:</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sub Betulis arboribus in candido &amp; rufo colore varii nascuntur Fungi, quos <i class="calibre4">Fliegen-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">schivemme,</i> id est, Muscarios fungos vocamus, quoniarn muscas lacte intriti occidunt.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Under birch trees, white and red in color, spring up various fungi that we call <i class="calibre4">Fliegen-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">schwamme,</i> that is, 'fly-fungi', since when crumpled in milk they kill flies.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The father of the science of mycology is the designation that has often been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bestowed on Charles de Lecluse, a Frenchman of Arras, whose contributions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to botany make him a major figure in the history of that branch of knowledge.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The year 1601 saw the publication in Antwerp of his <i class="calibre4">Rariomm Plantarum Historia,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">an important work in which a sizeable section was devoted to the fungi of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hungary, or 'Pannonia' as the region was called. Carolus Clusius, the name by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which De Lecluse is better known, was the first writer on mushrooms who</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fixed on them his gaze, describing them with the fidelity of a man who sees</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and puts down on paper what he sees. His description of the amanita muscaria</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is exact, and then he refers to the flies:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Invenitur etiam hsec species in caeduis silvis Francofurto ad Mcenum vicinis, unde</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rustics mulieres lectam, in urbem deferunt venalem, cum non ignorent plerosque empturos</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ad muscas necandas: nam cum, ut dixi, muscse libenter illi insideant, divulsam in frag-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">muscas, succum sugunt ipsis perniciosum, &amp; paulo post etiam lethalem.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This species is also found in the aged forests around Frankfort-on-the-Main, where it is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">collected by peasant women and brought to the city for sale. Since most of the buyers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">know it well, they buy it to kill flies with. And so, as I said before, since the flies like to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sit [on these mushrooms] people scatter them in pieces around the room and strew them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">before the windows; the flies, attracted and excited, suck the juice which is poisonous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for them and soon die.</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_88">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Albertus Magnus, von Megenberg, Valerius Cordus, Carolus Clusius - here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is a formidable foursome supporting with their testimony the traditional view</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the fly amanita. A critic, however, might find occasion for certain reservations.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">All four were Germans or writing against a background of German experience.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Why did not the Greek, Latin, French, and Italian writers report the same</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phenomenon &gt; The credibility of Albertus Magnus is somewhat impugned by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his description of the mushroom: the amanita muscaria has no windy pustules</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggestive of lepers. The Doctor Universalis must never have focused his eyes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the fungus he was describing: at least part of what he said was hearsay. Von</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Megenberg exposes himself to the same criticism. Just before the sentences</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about the fly amanita, he has described another species, the <i class="calibre4">Pfijferling,</i> which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in his day meant the lactarius piperatus, and he erroneously declares that it is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mortal poison. Here, translated, are his words: " One must watch out, for they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are often most poisonous and can sometimes make a man deathly ill. . . We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have an instance of this in Austria: a man ate a dish <i class="calibre4">o£ Pfifferling</i> and then drank</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strong mead, and he died at once in front of the barrel. This is true, by God!"</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As witnesses, both Albertus Magnus and von Megenberg would be in trouble on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cross-examination by opposing counsel: their writings are a blend of the learning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the hearsay of their time. Valerius Cordus' brief statement adds nothing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beyond his own adherence to a popular belief. Clusius introduces a new note:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he is the first to inform us that the use of the fly amanita as an insecticide was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">exceptional: he places the custom around Frankfort, and by implication tells us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that it was not known elsewhere. He was a traveled man, and he lived in Frank-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fort from 1587 to 1593.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is a peculiar thing about Clusius' remarks on the fly fungi. He does</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not consider these mushrooms a species. He describes them under the heading</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Genus XII of pernicious mushrooms, and this genus he sub-divides into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">five or six species, all of which he says kill flies. With the aid of Clusius' water-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">colors preserved in Leiden, the Hungarian scholar Dr. Gy. Istvanffi de Czik-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Madefalva has identified these species, two of them being russulas, one of them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">certainly a cortinarius, and two of them amanitas.2 When Clusius reports the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use of a fly fungus by the housewives of Frankfort, he is referring to the amanita</p>

  <p class="calibre1">muscaria. As Clusius was a reliable reporter, we must keep in mind that in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. The largest and most popular old Polish herbal, written by a Cracow Professor of medicine named Syrenius</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(f 1611) and published in 1613 in Cracow, says under <i class="calibre4">muchomor</i> on p. 1394: "One boils fly amanitas in sweet</p>

  <p class="calibre1">milk; then one pours it into bowls. Flies fly down to the milk and perish." We have not seen this work. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reader will observe that Syrenius boils his concoction, which would certainly not help its insecticidal powers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. See this author's <i class="calibre4">Etudes et Commentaries sur le Code de I'Eduse Augmentes de Quelques Notices Biographiques,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Budapest, 1900.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">20O</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE FLIES IN THE AMANITA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">former times, when the tradition of fly-killing fungi was still strong in folklore,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not one but several species probably bore this designation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This leads us to Linnaeus. The great Swedish scientist in his <i class="calibre4">Flora Svecica</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">repeated the statement about killing flies, but instead of placing the custom in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Frankfort, he said it prevailed in Smolandia, a Swedish province where he had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">spent his childhood:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cum lacte occidit Muscas in Smolandia.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This is not the only reference to the insecticidal amanita in Linnaeus. In his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">famous <i class="calibre4">Skanske Resa</i> ('Journey through Scania'), published in 1751, on page</p>

  <p class="calibre1">430, he tells how a certain Swede in Upsala got rid of bedbugs from two of his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms by the use of the amanita muscaria. He describes the remedy and then</p>

  <p class="calibre1">concludes with what we consider a most significant statement:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One takes in the autumn fresh specimens of the fly amanita, pounds them with a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pestle quite small in a jar, lets them stand well closed until they become slimy or like</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gruel. Then one takes a feather or brush and smears all the cracks and corners where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they [the bedbugs] keep themselves, and this procedure is repeated several times at monthly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">intervals. The room stinks for two or three days, but then the smell disappears. These</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nasty creatures die of it as if the plague had come amidst them, and whole bug-families</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perish as if from the Black Death. Although this remedy is simple, it is surer than</p>

  <p class="calibre1">anything else hitherto invented, and with its aid several houses in Upsala have now</p>

  <p class="calibre1">become free of bugs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In a note on the next page Linnasus adds that he has learned of this method for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the first time from a Mr. Bern, Cashier of Interests in Upsala. The text is in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Swedish.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For us the striking thing about this description is that it is a report on a novelty.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Certain families of Upsala were putting the popular reputation of the fly amanita</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to a test, and their first impression was enthusiastic. Why had they not been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">using it for centuries? What were their final conclusions, say five years later?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The answers to these questions are not vouchsafed to us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After Linnaeus the references to the fly-killing potency of the fly amanita in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroomic writings are innumerable. All the mycologists believe in it - with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one dissenting voice. None puts it to a test - with one exception. The French</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycologist Jean Baptiste Bulliard, in his <i class="calibre4">Histoire des Plantes Veneneuses et Suspectes</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">de la France,</i> which he finished in 1779, dares to strike a sceptical note. Speaking</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the fly amanita, he says:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I have never noticed that it kills flies, as several authors assert. I have had specimens, raw</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and cooked, for long periods in my apartment. Flies light on them, and seem even</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_89">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">to eat them, without bad effects. But I intend to repeat this experiment with certain new</p>

  <p class="calibre1">precautions.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We know not the results of the promised experiments, but we know that when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bulliard died in 1793, he held the view that a new scientific name should be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bestowed on the amanita muscaria, and he suggested 'agaricus pseudo-aurantia-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cus,' presumably because he considered the old name false. The mycological</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world has not deferred to his wishes, nor even tested his premises.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">-Dugs, flies, moths, and all kinds of larvae - in short, the insect world - consti-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tuted for our ancestors until recent times an order of nature instinct with super-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and stranger behavior, their incredible numbers and countless kinds, perhaps</p>

  <p class="calibre1">most of all their undeniable faculty of metamorphosis, may be at the root of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this role that they played in the thinking of untutored mankind. The fly was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">demonic, and we believe that the 'fly-fungus' originally meant the demonic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom, a name that fittingly designated a mushroom with the virtue of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">causing inebriation. We believe that the insecticidal meaning has encroached</p>

  <p class="calibre1">upon the ancient and primary sense, and finally shut it out.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We know that bugs and flies were linked with supernatural spirits a long</p>

  <p class="calibre1">time ago. The dung beetle or scarab played a conspicuous part in the religion of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the ancient Egyptians. The neighbors of the Israelites in the Old Testament</p>

  <p class="calibre1">worshipped Beelzebub, whose name meant the Lord of Flies. In the Greek New</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Testament, where that heathen god does not appear, the same name was used as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a synonym for the Prince of Demons. The Biblical term crops out in modern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">literature, as in line 1334 of Goethe's <i class="calibre4">Faust:</i> Wenn man Euch Fliegengott,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Verderber, Liigner heisst. . . "When one calls you Fly-god, Destroyer, Liar."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Nordic mythology the god Loki assumes the appearance of a 'fly' to enter the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tightly closed apartment of the sleeping goddess Freya. He pricks her, and when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">she starts, deftly detaches her necklace and steals it. Whatever that 'fly' was, no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one thought of it as a housefly, for the housefly does not bite.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In English the word 'bug' until the zyth century meant an evil spirit. Then,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when that meaning fell from grace in good society, the word came to designate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a creeping insect of the beetle class. Its etymology is unknown. It is current in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Welsh in both meanings, in the simple form <i class="calibre4">bwg</i> and in compounds. It seems</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to correspond to Cornish <i class="calibre4">bucca</i> and to Irish <i class="calibre4">bocdn,</i> both meaning hobgoblin.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We suggest that all these words are related to Anglo-Saxon <i class="calibre4">hue,</i> meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'belly'. The semantic link between inflatable sacs and demonic spirits would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">parallel the same double layer of meanings in our <i class="calibre4">pogge-cluster</i> of words. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ernest Weekley in his <i class="calibre4">Etymological Dictionary of the English Language</i> says that 'bug'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the supernatural sense is obsolete, except in the compounds 'bugbear' and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'bugaboo', and other lexicographers lean to the same view. Surely they are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mistaken: the tabu that hangs over words in low and colloquial use sometimes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shuts off the minds of scholars from rich evidence. Few words are so dynamic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and versatile as this one is in the United States. Besides bugbear and bugaboo,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in compounds we have humbug, firebug, jitterbug, and that contemptuous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word for an insane asylum, bughouse. There are of course the variants in -o-,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">- bogey, bogeyman, boggart (in England's North Country), possibly bogus,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the verbs to bogle and to boggle. The Oxford Dictionary in one citation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">offers grounds for supposing that 'buggy' was a nickname bestowed in the i8th</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century on a new design of two-wheeled vehicle, presumably because the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">makers had not yet got rid of the 'bugs' and the vehicle was insecure. In the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">United States a Big Bug used to be a common designation for an important</p>

  <p class="calibre1">person, a madman is 'bugs' and fit for the bughouse, a newly designed engine is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">usually full of 'bugs', and a specialist in any field is a 'bug' on the subject. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the course of casual reading in the American press, we pick out repeated uses of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'bug' that suggest demonic inspiration. From the <i class="calibre4">Saturday Evening Post</i> on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">March 10, 1951, we learn that all Dixie is bitten by the basketball bug. On</p>

  <p class="calibre1">March 15 of the same year the <i class="calibre4">New York World-Telegram and Sun</i> launches a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drive for circulation with a 'Bugs Bunny Coloring Contest', the 'bugs' in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">question being demonic imps and not insects. On May 8, 1953, <i class="calibre4">The New York</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Times</i> in its 'Topics' says that Vice President Nixon has been bitten by a golf bug.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the same date the afternoon newspaper reports that the Allies seek to clear</p>

  <p class="calibre1">up the 'bugs' in the truce terms in Korea. On May 17, we learn in a book review</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in <i class="calibre4">The New York Times</i> that the defeated United Nations troops in Korea,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when they were falling back as best they could in late 1950, referred to their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">retreat as 'bugging out', a term that suggested both devilish resourcefulness and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the goddess Luck. On July 14 the <i class="calibre4">Daily News</i> of New York reported in big</p>

  <p class="calibre1">headlines that the 'boat bug bites thousands', meaning that summer throngs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seek to go boating. The idea of distension is dominant in the vulgar American</p>

  <p class="calibre1">verb 'to bug out', meaning 'to bulge'. Tennessee Williams in his short story,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out!".1 If we are right, in this vulgarism the word preserves its pristine meaning,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">today largely superseded by a specific and secondary application to tiny, crawl-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing vermin. On the campus of Wayne University, in Detroit, 'buggy' has been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reported in recent years as a students' word for 'upset' or 'mentally disturbed'.2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is easy to see how Bugg came to be an English family name, for it enjoys</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to this day a vigorous existence, with an -s attached, as a respected nickname;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">e.g., Bugs Raymond the once mighty baseball pitcher, Bugs Baer the beloved</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cartoonist and Hearst writer, and Bugsy Siegel, the gangster who died a sudden</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and violent death in surroundings of gaudy splendor. In June 1941 Charles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Workman, known as 'the Bug', stood trial in the New Jersey Court of Common</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pleas for the murder of Arthur (Dutch Schultz) Flegenheimer. When one of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bug's witnesses reversed his own testimony, the defendant changed his plea</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from not guilty to non vult, and thereby avoided the death penalty but bowed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to an inevitable life sentence. In the course of that trial one of the off-stage</p>

  <p class="calibre1">figures was Martin (Buggsy) Goldstein.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Let it be noted that in the minds of those who bestow these bug-inspired</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nicknames, they are titles in which affection, awe, and envy are mixed. They</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are an expression of deference toward the ingenious demons that possess the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">honored person. Let it be further noted that current usage inclines toward a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">plural visitation of imps, though in the case of Bugs Baer we can testify that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in his immediate circle he like Charles Workman is often simply 'the Bug'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Bug' also turns up in place-names, as in Bugtussle, in Cullman County,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alabama. Curious about the origin of such a name, we addressed our inquiry</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to a citizen in nearby Bremen, whose reply deserves preservation:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some forty years ago we had a postoffice here: Wilburn. Two drunks were fighting,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Will James and Charles Campbell. James called it Bugtussle. So it has been called</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bugtussle by a part of the people ever since that time. 12-20-49.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[Signed] G. C. Florence.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">May Bugtussle forever remain faithful to a name born in Homeric circum-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stances, commemorating the spot where once strove together the two Big Bugs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In England we find a Buglawton in Cheshire and a Bugthorpe in the East</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Riding of Yorkshire, and Eilert Ekwall in his dictionary of English place-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">names permits us to associate these towns with our 'bug' of supernatural powers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">derived from its original sense, a power of verbal metamorphosis that befits</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE FLIES IN THE AMANITA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the world of six-legged creatures. Take telegraphy, for example. In the early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">days of the telegraph, the transmitting key worked perpendicularly, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">telegrapher had to lower and release his hand for every dot and every dash.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Later, perhaps half a century ago, a device appeared that permitted much faster</p>

  <p class="calibre1">manual transmission. The new key worked horizontally, to left and to right of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a neutral position, making dots continuously as long as it was pressed to one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">side. The hand no longer moved for each dot, but only when dots changed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to dashes. The thing seemed possessed of the devil, it went so fast, and everyone</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the craft was soon calling it the 'bug'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With the verb 'to bugger' a double problem presents itself. The meaning that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is written into the criminal law comes from the French <i class="calibre4">bougre,</i> and seems to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have emerged at the time of the Albigensian heresy in referring to the perverted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">practices attributed, unjustly, to the devotees of that sect. But throughout the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English-speaking world there has always been an innocent use, as when the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sailor says of his gear that it is all buggered up,1 and when a Lancashireman pays</p>

  <p class="calibre1">another the compliment of calling him a 'rare old bugger'. In circles where an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">improper word is excluded, this verb has nourished down to our own times.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We suggest that this innocent use offers us a verbal form derived from 'bug'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as a sprite, that it is native in English, and that the younger word imported</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from France has led until recently a segregated existence. Today the bad word,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">becoming more widely known, is driving out the good (as Gresham says),</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the detriment of the language. For education as it spreads breeds new mis-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">understandings and new ignorances.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In an English translation of the Bible that bears the date 1549, it was possible</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for pious scholars to render Psalm xci: 5 thus:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">. . . thou shalt not need to be afrayed for any bugges by night nor for the arrowe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that flyeth by daye;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a verse that emerges cleansed in the Authorized Version:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by day.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Bug' in the sense of a creeping, six-legged creature is first recorded early in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">iyth century, but it may have been long in use on the tongues of the untutored</p>

  <p class="calibre1">people who made up most of the population of England. Are we dealing here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with two words or one? The Oxford Dictionary reserved judgment on this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nice point, but in a study of the word published in December 1935 and 1936</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. See Joanna Carver Colcord's Sea <i class="calibre4">Language Comes Ashore,</i> Cornell Maritime Press, N. Y., 1945, p. 43, <b class="calibre5">for</b></p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_91">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">in the <i class="calibre4">PMLA</i> (the journal of the Modern Language Association of America),</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Miss Hope Emily Allen established beyond reasonable doubt that the two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meanings belong to a single word. The six-legged beetle was felt to be the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">habitation of a demon, and took his name. The Oxford Dictionary reveals a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">parallel association of ideas in the word 'fly', for this word not only refers to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">insects but also has always meant a 'familiar spirit', a usage that survives to this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">day in the adjective 'fly', rated as slang by some, meaning nimble, dexterous, sharp.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Russian language there is an astonishing parallel for the two meanings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of these English words. Children in Muscovy are admonished to behave lest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4">buka</i> get them. The <i class="calibre4">buka</i> is the children's bugbear. The <i class="calibre4">bukashka</i> is any small</p>

  <p class="calibre1">flying buzzing beetle. Slavists consider that the two words are related to each</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other, and that both are keyed to the basic word <i class="calibre4">byk,</i> 'bull'. Until a thorough</p>

  <p class="calibre1">study of the demonic vocabulary of Northern Europe has been made, perhaps</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the door should be left open for alternative possibilities.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Albertus Magnus and Valerius Cordus referred in Latin and German</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the 'flies' killed by the fly amanita, what insect had they in mind? What</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meanings and associations did the words possess for them &gt; Today 'fly' means the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">housefly, or, by extension, other species of two-winged insects. But this is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">modern concentration of the meaning, the result of increasingly precise obser-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vations in the insect world. The Oxford Dictionary establishes the fact that in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">former times 'fly' ordinarily designated insects as divergent as locusts, moths,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gnats, and the whole dipterous order. To this day there are High German</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dialects in which <i class="calibre4">Fliege</i> and <i class="calibre4">Mucke</i> mean both 'fly' and 'mosquito', as does the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word <i class="calibre4">mich</i> in Frisian. The older usage survives in the angler's 'flies', which descend</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from all kinds of flying insects. In the Indian and Iranian languages the words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for 'fly' are often used for 'bee' or are the base from which their words for 'bee'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are formed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Good illustrations of this early generic usage are to be found in Basque,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where the primitive form of the word 'fly' was <i class="calibre4">uli.</i> In a variety of forms this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word enters into the names of many insects: <i class="calibre4">eltxo,</i> mosquito; <i class="calibre4">uli farfalia,</i> butter-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fly; <i class="calibre4">eltzar,</i> caterpillar; <i class="calibre4">eltxu,</i> locust; and, perhaps the most interesting of all,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a word used by the Basques of Guipuzcoa, <i class="calibre4">eultza,</i> meaning a bee-hive, the second</p>

  <p class="calibre1">syllable being simply a collective suffix. A bee-hive is a 'fly-hive', and in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dialect of Bermeo in the same province, a wasp is an <i class="calibre4">ulabio,</i> the first element</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning 'fly' and the second being derived from the Romance word for 'bee',</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">abeille</i> and <i class="calibre4">abeja.1</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">I.</i> See Gerhard Bahr, 'Nombres de animales en vascuence', in <i class="calibre4">Revue Internationale des Etudes basques,</i> vol. xxvn,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE FLIES IN THE AMANITA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The variable application of the words for 'fly' in former times was not a con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scious use of a general term. It is to be explained rather by the ordinary man's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inability to distinguish among flying insects, so that he was disposed to use</p>

  <p class="calibre1">without precision such words as he possessed for the insect world. This was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">common to the period, and therefore to all languages. The ordinary syrphus or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">carrion fly was considered for thousands of years to be the same as the honey</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bee and bore the same name: this is the insect that Samson found swarming in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the carcass of a lion. The fact of metamorphosis in the insect world was known,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and maggots and other carrion worms were known to be kin to the insect</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world, but the successive transformations were not carefully distinguished by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">species. In Dutch the word for 'moth', which is <i class="calibre4">mot,</i> serves for maggots also.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sometimes accidents of sound led to confusions in names. In English 'flea' and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'fly' are words of different origins, but the phonetic similarity caused them to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be used interchangeably. In <i class="calibre4">Henry V</i> we learn that when Falstaff lay dying, he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">saw a 'Flea' stick upon the toper Bardolph's flaming nose, whereupon he said</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it was a 'blacke Soule burning in Hell'. What he saw was of course a fly, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">black soul in hell was, according to the beliefs of that day, its incorporeal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">counterpart, the Demon domiciled in every fly.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For all insects used to be considered agents of demonic powers and were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clothed in a fearsome aura of mystery and magic. We believe we can adduce new</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and striking evidence of this. On an earlier page we pointed out that Satan was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known in France at one time as <i class="calibre4">le Bot,</i> 'the Cripple'; and that this name came to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be transferred to the toad, and in the form <i class="calibre4">hot volant</i> to the nightjar and the bat,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nocturnal flying creatures of evil omen. We suggested that the form of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English word 'bat' is attributable to the French word, but we did not then point</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out the wider applications in English of the French word. 'Bot' in English is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the larva of the gadfly; it occurs also in 'botfly'. What was originally a eu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phemism for Satan himself thus turns up in English as a word of the insect</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world. Satan resides in the botfly and in the larva of the gadfly. In Joseph Wright's</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">English Dialect Dictionary</i> we find that 'bot' and 'bat' are dialectal variants of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">each other, and that in various parts of the United Kingdom 'bat' is used for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'moth'. (The larger moths, nocturnal in habit, were formerly 'flies' of specially</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evil potency.) In many counties of England 'bot' has been used colloquially for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all kinds of grubs and larvas, even turning up in Wright's pages as a designation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the flying 'bat'. The dictionaries declare that the origin of'bot' is unknown;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we think they have overlooked the multivalent service rendered by the French</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">bot</i> and failed to detect the common Satanic denominator between it and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English term.</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_92">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">The word 'maggot', in turn, besides designating larvae, has always meant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">an evil caprice. John O'Donnell in the New York <i class="calibre4">Daily News</i> on October 28,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1952, devoted his column to 'Mr. Truman's Maggot', by which he meant "a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">maggotty individual full of whims", and the use of the word in this sense is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">richly documented in the Oxford Dictionary. In Smollett's <i class="calibre4">The Reprisal; or,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Tars of Old England</i> one of the characters says that "now we man [must] . . .</p>

  <p class="calibre1">defend her from the maggots of this daft Frenchman", who had been " sent awa'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with a flea [sic] in his bonnet". The etymology of 'maggot' is unknown, ac-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cording to the dictionaries. But if we view this word against the background of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">double meanings that it and 'bot', 'fly', and 'bee' carry, the likelihood presents</p>

  <p class="calibre1">itself that 'maggot' (which was spelled 'magot' in its first recorded appearance</p>

  <p class="calibre1">around the year 1400) is related to 'magic', and both are then to be explained as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">derived, via French, from the Necromancers known as the Magi. When the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Flemings and Dutch in former times called mushrooms the devil's bread, they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must have had in mind the demonic larvae, maggots, and 'flies' that batten on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the flesh of many wild fungi.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Middle Ages delirium, drunkenness, and insanity were attributed to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">insects that were loose inside the head of the victim. This belief, strange for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">modern mind, survives in many familiar locutions. A man has a bee in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bonnet, a fly (or bug) in his ear, or demonic bats (= 'bots') in his belfry. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Norwegians get flies into their heads or put flies into others' heads. To 'put a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bee on someone' means to fix him willy nilly for a given purpose: in this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">locution the demonic intent is scarcely fossilized. It used to be said in French,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when a man was getting excited, that 'la mouche lui monte a la tete', a fly is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">getting up into his head. Down to recent times <i class="calibre4">avaler les mouches</i> was a phrase</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for saying that someone had summoned up his courage, and the flies thus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">swallowed were of course demonic. Rabelais at the very end of Book IV makes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the coward Panurge protest that, far from being afraid, he is braver than if he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had eaten all the flies cooked in the pastries of Paris betwixt St. John's Day</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and All Saints'.There is a colloquial expression that circulates around Lyons and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perhaps elsewhere: 'Ne prends pas la mouche': don't catch a fly, don't get excited.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of a man who is unbalanced one says, '11 a 1'araignee dans le plafond', he has a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">spider in his ceiling, i.e., in his upper story. The Czechs use an identical phrase:</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">miti mouchu</i> (or <i class="calibre4">pavouka] na mozku,</i> 'to have a fly (or spider) on the brain'. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Russian, we say of a man who is tipsy: <i class="calibre4">on c mnkhoj,</i> so-and-so is 'with fly'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is a gesture peculiar to the Russians that we feel sure stems from this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">association of psychic possession with flying insects. The Russian when he sug-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gests having an alcocholic drink is like as not to perform a fillip against his neck</p>

  <p class="calibre1">below the ear: this is so habitual that it is become a Pavlov reflex. Does not that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">familiar fillip invoke the demonic 'fly' entering the mind? According to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Icelandic-English lexicon of Cleasby-Vigfusson, under <i class="calibre4">fluga,</i> in Icelandic belief</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sorcerers would bewitch flies and send them to kill their enemies. This explains</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the modern Icelandic phrases, 'to swallow the fly' or 'to carry the fly', meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'to be the tool of another man in a wicked business'. In Basque folklore, sorcerers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and other malevolent beings would work their will through demons that as-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sumed the shape of flies, and sorcerers would carry the demonic creatures in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sheath such as anglers use for their flies today. In America little children to this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">day sing a nonsense ditty that invokes the 'bug' of demonic possession:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It's raining, it's pouring,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The old man is snoring,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He went to bed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With a bug in his head, And</p>

  <p class="calibre1">didn't get up until morning.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hieronymus Bosch, the greatest of Europe's painters of the demonic world,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">presents us with a superb illustration of flies in their demonic role. We find it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the left hand panel of the <i class="calibre4">Hay Wain,</i> where the momentous events that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">took place in Paradise leading up to Man's First Fall are portrayed with moving</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beauty. We reproduce the upper portion of that panel, wherein the observer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sees that the angels tumbling down from Heaven assume the form of 'flies' - a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">diverse lot of winged demons, Beelzebub's host. The old meaning is far from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dead even today. Recently <i class="calibre4">The Times Literary Supplement</i> published a poem by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">H. S. Mackintosh containing these sprightly lines:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Has Freud not hit the Devil on the snout?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Is not Beelzebub destroyed by Flit? Are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we important? Do we really sprout</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Immortal souls that priests may manumit?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps the reader will perceive the direction in which our argument is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">heading. We have seen on an earlier page that when the French refer to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amanita muscaria as the <i class="calibre4">crapaudin,</i> this by way of the Old French word for toad,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">bot,</i> means the demonic mushroom. It is a word unrelated to insecticidal uses.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In English that demonic word <i class="calibre4">bot</i> is transferred to the insect world, and shares</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with 'maggot', 'bee', and 'fly' the idea of demonic possession. When we find the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">crapaudin</i> called the <i class="calibre4">Fliegenschwamm</i> in German, we sense a semantic identity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Both words are singularly appropriate for the inebriating mushroom, and they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inform us that long ago, much earlier even than Albertus Magnus, the secret of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this mushroom was known. And if it was known, why should it not, on ap-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">propriate occasions, have been put to its own great, even fearsome, use;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One of the most interesting examples of the Satanic fly in European literature</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is to be found in that classic of the Danish stage, Ludvig Holberg's <i class="calibre4">Jeppe of the</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Hill,</i> first produced in 1722. Two physicians are conversing. One of them speaks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of his Lordship, who has had a strange, ugly dream, which so excited him that he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">imagines himself a peasant. Whereupon the other physician recalls a remarkable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">case ten years back: "... a man who thought his head was full of flies. He could</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not rid himself of the delusion, until a most clever doctor cured him in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">following manner. He covered his patient's whole head with a plaster in which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he had embedded masses of dead flies. [Query: were they the Spanish flies of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pharmacopoeia &gt;] After a while he removed the plaster and showed the flies to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the patient, who naturally believed that they had been drawn from his own head</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and therefore concluded that he was cured." Here is a beautiful instance of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">way a dramatist (or physician) puts to use an outworn belief that lingers on in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the penumbra of man's consciousness.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Old and forgotten beliefs often survive in strange places, in usages that on their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">face are baffling. Miss Allen has pointed out that in the nursery language of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">little children, the homely words used for dried or inspissated nasal mucus,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">such as 'buggy bear' and 'bug', are linked with the spirit world. In Russian the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">corresponding word is <i class="calibre4">kozjavka,</i> which means larva or any small creeping thing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is an expression, <i class="calibre4">vsjakaja kozjavka lezet v bukashki -</i> 'every larva would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be a fly'; and <i class="calibre4">bukashka</i> is a diminutive of <i class="calibre4">buka,</i> bugbear. We believe that these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nursery words for dried nasal mucus are a legacy of the medieval belief that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when sanity returns to a man who has been out of his mind, an observant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attendant can catch sight of an insect emerging from the nostril of the patient.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thus that escaping bug or maggot or bot or fly survives to this day in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">metaphor on the tongues of unknowing children. We should add that this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">interpretation is ours, and not Miss Allen's.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This belief in the demonic role of flying and creeping insects is not confined</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to Europe and the Mediterranean. We think we find telling evidence in favor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of our argument in that the area of diffusion of this belief embraces the Chukchees</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Korjaks, the very peoples where the use of the fly amanita survives. Jochelson</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in his treatise on the Korjaks reports that if the eater of the fly amanita vomits,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">her paper on <i class="calibre4">Bogus</i> in <i class="calibre4">American Notes &amp; Queries,</i> Sept.-Oct. 1941, and on the wood-louse in <i class="calibre4">the Journal of Ame-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">2 I O</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE FLIES IN THE AMANITA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the people believe that the spirits of the demonic mushroom can be found in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vomit as 'worms' which then quickly vanish into the earth.1 Bogoras in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">study of the Chukchees says that the shamans think psychic disturbances are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">caused by insects, and they use insects in their treatment of mental disorders.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The shaman catches an insect from off his drum, swallows it, spits it up, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">applies it to the head of the victim; he then sucks the sick man's head. Sometimes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the insect is imaginary, sometimes real.2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It befits the amanita muscaria, with its unique prestige among country-folk</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the villain of the fungal world, that the pattern of vernacular names for it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should be correspondingly subtle. Over large areas it is the mushroom with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'flies' in its cap. In France it is the domicile of the <i class="calibre4">hot</i> or toad, by which is meant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Satan; and in the Basque <i class="calibre4">amoroto</i> we find the same presence. This raises the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">question whether the English 'toadstool' was not once the specific name of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fly amanita, just as in the Haute Saone Eugene Rolland reports <i class="calibre4">bo</i> as a designa-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion for any gilled fungus, and in the Loire, <i class="calibre4">botet,</i> both presumably meaning,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by way of 'toad', the Satanic fungus. We have said before that Rolland reports</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tuo-mouscos,</i> 'fly-killer', in the Aude, and there this name, significantly, competes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with another, <i class="calibre4">mijoulo folho,</i> the 'mad-mushroom', as though the two were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">synonyms. The idea of madness is reported in several other common names for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fly amanita: <i class="calibre4">mujolo folo</i> around Toulouse, <i class="calibre4">coucourlo fouolo</i> in the Aveyron,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and <i class="calibre4">oriol foil</i> in Catalan, 'mad oriole', the oriole being the amanita csesarea.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the dialect of Fribourg, Switzerland, the amanita muscaria is the 'devil's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hat', <i class="calibre4">tsapl de diablhou.</i> In all this nomenclature the toad and the fly are synonyms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and complementary, and both mean madness and Satanic possession.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On a later page we shall discuss the small group of painters, mostly Dutch,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who devoted their talents in the iyth century to still-life studies of demonological</p>

  <p class="calibre1">subjects. These painters, superb technicians, have seldom been surpassed in their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">solicitude for portraying nature faithfully. They assembled their curious com-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">positions, not capriciously, but to express folk-beliefs that were already wan-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing, and therefore their canvases offer us folkloric documentation of high value.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So far as we know, this aspect of their art has not yet been studied. We repro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">duce one of these paintings, a canvas by Otto Marseus van Schrieck, which hangs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">today in the Bale art museum. The composition is admirably handled. In a small</p>

  <p class="calibre1">field there are more than twenty mushrooms, most of them identifiable. Dominat-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing the center of the scene is the latticed fungus known as the clathrus cancellatus,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">here slightly constrained to suggest a death's head. On the extreme right is one of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the coprini, caught in its moment of active deliquescence. There is a grass snake</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the Netherlands. The snake is about to seize a beetle. A dragon fly with a pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nounced curvature approaches the large mushroom that seems to be a stropharia</p>

  <p class="calibre1">semiglobata. Of highest interest for us is the 'fly' that descends on the amanita.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Bale museum calls this insect a butterfly <i class="calibre4">(Schmetterling),</i> but this is an error.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is a moth, the most sinister of the 'flies', and the painter was so intent on an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">accurate statement of his message that he permits us to identify the moth as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">belonging to the family called saturnine, i.e., one of the saturniidse. Thus here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in this nocturnal gathering heavy with demonic import we discover a 'fly', -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the 'fly' that gives its name to the fly amanita, a 'fly' that for our ancestors was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">saturated with magical potency. Missing from the scene are the amphibia:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">neither toad nor frog do we see. Van Schrieck knew the virtue of economy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in utterance, and the omission of the toad was for him obligatory. In the pres-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ence of the 'fly', the <i class="calibre4">padde</i> or <i class="calibre4">hot</i> would have been redundant, iconographically</p>

  <p class="calibre1">otiose, an intruder speaking the same message but in a different idiom. Its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">presence would mean piling not Pelion on Ossa, but <i class="calibre4">paddestoel</i> on <i class="calibre4">vliegenzwam.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The fly amanita holds an altogether extraordinary place in the folk culture of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">northern and eastern Europe. The deadly fungi are as nothing in comparison,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in the mycophobic world of the Germanic peoples no edible kind was of im-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">portance until recent times. For us it is altogether incredible that the grip of this</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Fliegenschwamtn</i> on the imaginations of countless generations sprang from any in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">secticidal power that it may have. It possessed in men's minds a supernatural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">potency, the potency of the 'flies', and though direct, affirmative testimony is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meager, we believe that the prestige of the fly amanita descended from a know-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ledge, in at least some circles at some period, of its divine or demonic powers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Up to this point our argument about the fly amanita has been an intellectual</p>

  <p class="calibre1">exercise. We have offered an alternative explanation for the name. We have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">impugned the traditional explanation by challenging the credibility of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">witnesses. Albertus Magnus and Von Megenberg were relying on hearsay, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so indeed was Linnaeus when he quoted a Mr. Bern about the bedbugs. Most</p>

  <p class="calibre1">writers place the fly-killing use at a distance from themselves in time or space,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Clusius in Frankfort, Linnaeus in Smolandia, John Ramsbottom in Poland,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bohemia, and Rumania. Mr. Ramsbottom1 also says that the fly amanita was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'formerly' used in England and Sweden for killing bedbugs, and thus he justifies</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the occasional occurrence of the name 'bug agaric'. But this term can not be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">really old, for Linnaeus by his great authority imposed the name 'agaric' on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. See his <i class="calibre4">Poisonous Fungi,</i> Penguin Books Limited, 1945, p. 21.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2 1 2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE FLIES IN THE AMANITA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the gilled fungi and the use of 'bug' for 'bedbug' appears to be a modernism,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whereas 'fly' and 'bug' in their demonic sense are truly old. Only Bulliard put</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fly amanita to the test, and his findings seem to have been cleanly negative.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But in support of Bulliard's scepticism we can add a story told to us by a Russian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">friend, Ekaterina Apollinarievna Bouteneff. Her nurse in childhood was an un-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lettered peasant woman from the region of Riazan. Our friend remembers having</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seen this good woman time and again put out a saucer with a crushed cap of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fly amanita in it, a lump of sugar on top of the fungal mess. This was going to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kill the flies, she would always say. But our friend always observed that the flies</p>

  <p class="calibre1">did not die. When she would ask her nurse why they did not die, the reply was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">always the same: "They are sure to die later."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the summer of 1953, on our suggestion, the mycologist F.-E. Eckblad of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Botanical Museum in Oslo, working under Professor Nordhagen, undertook</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the experiments that were a desideratum for our case. In a letter addressed to us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on September 8 he sent us his preliminary conclusions. They, like Bulliard's,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were negative: "The fly amanita may contain matters poisonous to flies. But</p>

  <p class="calibre1">flies are not attracted to it, perhaps avoid it, and are not killed by it when used</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the old way", i.e., mixed with sugar or milk or both. Mr. Eckblad warns</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that his findings must be considered tentative, both because his supply of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms had not been so plentiful as he had hoped and because several</p>

  <p class="calibre1">species of flies were present in insufficient numbers. But on the strength of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the first season's experiments there was no evidence of insecticidal virtue in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fly amanita. On the other hand, experiments carried out during the same</p>

  <p class="calibre1">season at the Laboratoire de Cryptogamie of the Museum National d'Histoire</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Naturelle in Paris gave different results: the flies were drawn to the con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coction and died from it, and they died more quickly when the milk was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sweetened with sugar. Once again the evidence leaves us in suspense, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">experiment calls for retrial by various workers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Even if the fly amanita kills flies, our conclusions will not be invalidated, for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the name could carry two layers of meaning, one for housewives and the other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for those initiated in sacred mysteries.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">However, if it should develop that the fly amanita never harmed a fly, we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should find ourselves confronted with a new question: how do we explain the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">legend ? Why did Albertus Magnus give it the endorsement of his immense</p>

  <p class="calibre1">renown? Why is the <i class="calibre4">Fliegenschwamm</i> called 'fly-killer' throughout the Slavic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world and by the peasants in certain provinces of France ?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Let us assume for the purposes of our argument that we are right, and that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fly amanita was really the 'demonic fungus' of northern Europe for untold</p>

  <p class="calibre1">CHAPTER FIVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">centuries of unrecorded history. Let us suppose that it was utilized for its inebriat-</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing virtue. Such use was certainly veiled in awe and mystery, and the secret</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">was the precious possession of esoteric and (need we add?) illiterate circles. As</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the missionaries of Mediterranean culture and religion probed the northern</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">forests and gained adherents, the custodians of the old culture, retreating before</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the new, would guard ever more zealously the lore that was their exclusive</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">possession and that survived solely by oral transmission from generation to</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">generation. From earliest times, in the pagan era, an alternative explanation for</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Fliegenschwamm must have been a convenience in satisfying the curiosity of</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the laity, and this popular rationalization was all that reached the ears of book-</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>
