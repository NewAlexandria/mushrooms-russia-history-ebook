      <span class="initial">F</span>OR murderers there is only one kind of mushroom worth considering: the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">amanita phalloides. Almost everyone who dies from mushrooms dies from it;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">and most of those who have eaten it have died from it. Even a small piece of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the cap may kill a grown man. Specimens are easy to identify and easy to find&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">in season - from August into October. Their poisonous virtue survives cooking,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">freezing, and drying. To speak more accurately, the deadly species are three in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">number, for we must add the amanita verna and the amanita virosa, but all three&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">resemble each other so closely both in appearance and toxic properties that the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">murderer, whose ends after all are empirical, will disregard the distinctions as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">academic. He looks for white gills, veil (or ring), and volva, taking care not to be&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">misled by any of the innocent amanitas, such as the citrina. On the autopsy&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">table the victim shows pathological lesions of the viscera, but unlike arsenic,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the pathologist cannot isolate the lethal agent, whose identity he must infer from&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the case history supplied by the attending physician, plus such evidence as can&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">be assembled to show that the victim had eaten the lethal fungi. From the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">murderer's point of view, the deadly amanita suffers from one shortcoming :</span>
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      some victims, after days or weeks or even months of shattering illness, slowly
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      recover and return to circulation. True, they are only frail replicas of their
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      former selves, but they are alive and have foiled the murderer's coup. On the
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      other hand, if the murderer also hates his victim, and if success attends his
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      undertaking, his worst instincts and hopes will have been more than quenched
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      by the slow progress and horrible suffering that attend the victim's downward
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      course into the grave. The symptoms of poisoning by the deadly amanita are
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      distinctive, dramatic, and terrifying.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      To begin with, the lethal amanitas taste good - on this the abundant testimony
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      of victims shows no dissenting voice. Nothing arouses suspicion as the greedy
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      diner consumes his fateful dish; nor does he suspect anything for many hours
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      thereafter. Indeed, the distinctive mark of this poison, its 'veritable signature' as
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Dr. Dujarric de la Riviere has aptly called it, is the period of absolute quiescence
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      that follows the ingestion of the mushrooms, a period that never lasts less than six<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">&nbsp;hours, and usually ten or twelve, sometimes twenty or even forty or more.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1">The victim goes about his affairs blissfully unaware that the fingers of death</p>

  <p class="calibre1">already entwine him. Perhaps he speaks with relish of the mushrooms he has</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eaten, even returning to another dish of the same kind at the next meal. If they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have been served to him intentionally, his murderer, standing by, eyes him with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wicked and dissembled solicitude, alert for the inevitable moment. Of a sudden</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the victim is gripped by appalling abdominal distress, followed by vomiting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and <i class="calibre4">diarrhoea fcetida.</i> Neither emetics nor purgatives can help him now, for his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">system has absorbed the venom, during the long period of silent invasion.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The initial seizure is followed by utter prostration, which in turn is succeeded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by another paroxysm like the first, and this alternation continues, perhaps for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">many days, until the victim, his pulse fast and weak, succumbs, usually after</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a delirious phase. The appearance of the patient meanwhile is marked by what</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the physicians describe as the Hippocratic facies - eyes sunken and staring as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">though with anxiety or even terror, skin over the cheekbones taut and parched,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nose pinched, temples hollow, ears leaden and cold, their lobes turned out,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lips relaxed, the whole face livid - an appearance that is clear harbinger of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">imminent dissolution.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our lugubrious, even sinister, approach to the toxic fungi presents the ele-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mentary facts that should be known to any detective story craftsman who re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sorts to mushroom poison as a device in the construction of a plot. The art of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the detective story is a minor literary genre proliferated by the English-speak-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing peoples. Its leading exponents are often conscientious in their scientific</p>

  <p class="calibre1">research. But when they invoke mushroom poisoning, they seem incapable of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">artistic performance, as though the mycophobia peculiar to the Celtic and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Anglo-Saxon races inhibited all inquiry into the dark recesses of the repellent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">subject. Mushrooms remain a mystery even to mystery writers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Before examining the texts, we must mention two other kinds of toxic mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms. First and foremost there is the amanita muscaria, erroneously regarded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by many laymen as <i class="calibre4">the</i> poisonous mushroom. Its evil reputation far outruns its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">deserts. It gives its name to 'muscarine', the agent that most physicians and even</p>

  <p class="calibre1">medical examiners in the English-speaking world regard as synonymous with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom poisoning. But the facts are that muscarine is seldom if ever fatal,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that it is destroyed by cooking, and that it exists in the amanita muscaria only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in traces, being much stronger in the amanita pantherina. The hallucinations and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">muscular exertions inspired by the amanita muscaria, followed by a period of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stupor, are attributable to the presence of a wholly different compound, which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">resembles atropin. The victim (or beneficiary) of this intoxicating mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUSHROOMS FOR MURDERERS</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is imbued with a new sense of dimensions, of physical powers, of miraculous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mobility.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of the remaining toxic mushrooms, there is a peculiar mystery about the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gyromitra esculenta, a common species much eaten (as its name suggests) in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Europe. Certain it is that at intervals cases occur where an individual dies from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it. The explanation may not yet be surely known, but if the best opinion avail-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">able today proves right, the gyromitra esculenta offers us a notable fungal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peculiarity. It seems that everyone may eat this tasty mushroom with impunity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the first time. But there are rare individuals who, if they return to a mess of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same species shortly thereafter, and if the mushrooms are fresh rather than</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dried, suffer a dangerous and even fatal anaphylactic shock.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dorothy L. Sayers with Robert Eustace in <i class="calibre4">The Documents in the Case</i> produced</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the supreme example in English of a mystery story based on fungal poisoning.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">An eccentric Englishman, George Harrison, made wild mushrooms his hobby</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(he was obviously eccentric), and in the end was found dead (as normal Eng-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lishmen would expect) in a lonely shack. The evidence indicated that he had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">recently eaten a mess of stewed mushrooms prepared by himself. The coroner</p>

  <p class="calibre1">after chemical analysis of the uneaten remains of the stew put the death down</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to accidental muscarine poisoning. The victim's son, Paul, was not satisfied, be-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cause he was certain his father, a careful man and excellent amateur mycologist,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">could never have confused the amanita muscaria with an edible species, and in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the end he ran down the real culprit, a lover of Paul's step-mother, a villain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">named Robert Lathom, who in due course was proved to have introduced</p>

  <p class="calibre1">synthetic muscarine into the stock that had served for the mushroom stew. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was tried, convicted, and hanged. The story is well told, with delightful touches</p>

  <p class="calibre1">revealing the mycophobic habits of mind of the run of Englishmen. But it suf-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fers from one defect: muscarine is destroyed by cooking and could not have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">caused the victim's death. True, the muscarine here involved is synthetic, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">no evidence is produced to show that, in resistance to heat, the synthetic product</p>

  <p class="calibre1">differs from the natural. Furthermore, the toxicity of fresh muscarine is exag-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gerated: the chances were excellent that Harrison would survive an uncooked</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dose. Lathom should have used amanitine, not muscarine - the amanita phal-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">loides, not the amanita muscaria - and for informed readers, his execution was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a painful miscarriage of justice, a tragic sequel to an incompetent performance</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by Defense Counsel.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Miss Sayers and Mr. Eustace used, or misused, a genuine mushroom. More</p>

  <p class="calibre1">often English authors create fictional species, tailored to fit their plots. Ernest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bramah in <i class="calibre4">The Eyes of Max Carrados</i> tells a story entitled 'The Mystery of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">49</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_55"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_23">CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Poisoned Dish of Mushrooms'. It hinges on the peculiar properties of a non-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">existent fungus on which he bestows a name unknown to mycology, the amanita</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bhuroides. (This name sounds like a misspelled derivative of Burrhus, a perso-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nage in attendance at the imperial court of Claudius and Nero.) It is so deadly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the victim expires within a half-hour of his seizure.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">More remarkable than the amanita bhuroides is the panseolus sherriffoides, as we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shall call the mushroom that the playwright R. C. Sherriff devises for his drama</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Miss Mabel.</i> His plot is unhappy, for we are expected to sympathize with a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kindly, somewhat demented heroine who poisons her wealthy and hateful</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sister, the widow Fletcher. The mycophile watches with astonishment as the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">author, by a very act of creation, invents his mushroom and clothes it with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">precisely those attributes that the plot requires. It appears in the spring: the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">daffodils are in bloom and Easter is yet to come. (In nature there are almost no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms then.) It grows fast, progressing noticeably in the course of a night's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rain. A cluster of nine serves as the lethal dose, but the playwright suggests that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fewer would have sufficed. When cooked, these mushrooms smell like hot</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rubber, but the smell is successfully overlaid with onions and tomatoes. Most</p>

  <p class="calibre1">remarkable are the toxic properties. These fungi are a powerful narcotic and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">put the victim to sleep at once. The widow Fletcher departs this life without</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pain, her ugly, resentful face assuming in death 'a look of such peace and gentle-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ness' that the audience is presumably reconciled to her hurried departure at the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hands of her sister.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yet another inventor of mushrooms is H. G. Wells, in his short story, <i class="calibre4">The</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Purple Pileus.</i> Here a mild-mannered, milktoast of a man named Coombes,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lower middle-class, finds himself browbeaten by his wife and her odious friend,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Clarence, to the point of desperation and suicide. He rushes from the house into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the woods. He thinks of drowning himself, but suddenly notices all the varied</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms around his feet. A purple pileus catches his eye, "a peculiarly poiso-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nous looking purple", slimy, shining, emitting a sour odor but not disgusting.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Coombes breaks off a piece, and the creamy white of the inside changes in ten</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seconds to a yellowish-green color. He remembers that his father had described</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this very species to him, and they were the deadliest poison. He tastes the thing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is pungent and he almost spits it out, but then it seems merely hot to the taste</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and full-flavored, a kind of German mustard with horse-radish. He swallows it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There ensues a curious tingling sensation in his finger-tips and toes. His pulse</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quickens. The blood in his ears sounds like a mill-race. He loses his balance and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">falls, and forgets everything. While he lies there unconscious, a peculiar transfor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mation takes place in his personality, for after a while he wakes up feeling bright</p>

  <p class="calibre1">50</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUSHROOMS FOR MURDERERS</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and cheerful, his complexion a livid white, his eyes large and bright, his pale</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lips drawn in a cheerless grin. The mild little man is now a lion, fit to be the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">master of his house. He goes home, and in a scene of violent retribution he im-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">poses his will on his wife and that noisome friend of hers. He is so successful</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the reformation in his household proves lasting, and the whole course of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Coombes's life is changed for the better.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Coombes's violence might suggest that he ate the amanita muscaria, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wells expressly distinguishes his purple pileus from that other species, "the red</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ones with white spots". Furthermore, the fly agaric produces a sleepy stupor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">after the spell of exhilaration, not before it. Wells, like Bramah and Sherriff,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fills out the necessities of a given plot by inventing the needed mushroom, on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which we here bestow the name of boletus wellsoides.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Have English authors ever invented flowers or bushes or trees with which to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">adorn the English countryside? It seems unlikely. Surrounded by mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that they never truly see, they usually ignore them, and on the rare occasions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when 'toadstools' are needed, they blithely misrepresent them, to make them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">serve an odious or exotic purpose.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With Wells and Sherriff and Bramah, we observe a peculiar aspect of the my-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cophobia of the English in its unconscious and spontaneous workings. Doubt-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">less many other examples could be assembled, and we shall mention a few. But</p>

  <p class="calibre1">first let us note and celebrate one exception. Anne Parrish in her novel <i class="calibre4">The</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Perennial Bachelor</i> dispatches one of her characters by means of a dish of mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms. Unlike ah1 the other writers about whom we speak, she shows herself</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thoroughly versed in the properties of the deadly amanita. The episode is only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">incidental to her plot, and this makes the accuracy of her details even more</p>

  <p class="calibre1">astounding. It is not as though she had worked hard on mushrooms in order</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to hang her story on them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In December 1949 <i class="calibre4">Ellery Queen s Mystery Magazine</i> published a yarn by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">August Derleth in which the murderer killed his victim by substituting for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">morels some specimens of the gyromitra esculenta - a species that no villain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bent on murder would ever rely on. In <i class="calibre4">Murder with Mushrooms,</i> Gordon Ashe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has his victim die the same night that he dines on poisonous mushrooms -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a tragic sequel that could not occur. In R. T. M. Scott's <i class="calibre4">Ann's Crime,</i> the victims</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inhale spores of the amanita phalloides that have been concealed in a cheese cloth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inside a pillow, and forthwith they die, for no doctor, we are told, could save a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">person whose head had once touched that pillow! . . . Has there been a single</p>

  <p class="calibre1">writer of detective or mystery stories who has done justice to the genuine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drama hidden in the properties peculiar to the amanita phalloides; The German</p>

  <p class="calibre1">51</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_57"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_24">CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">author Gustav Meyrink in his <i class="calibre4">Bal Macabre</i> deals with mushroom intoxication.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The story is drenched with a pathological atmosphere artfully contrived. There</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is much about mushrooms in the narrative, but the hallucinations that hang over</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the whole story seem to us to be best explained by the effects of alcohol, an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alcoholic's nightmare about toxic mushrooms. Meyrink reveals no knowledge</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of fungal toxicology. The prolific American writer Percival Wilde in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Tinsley's Bones,</i> published in 1942, introduces as a witness a knowledgeable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">female mycologist who seems to be addicted to mushrooms of the genus panaeo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lus as a substitute for cocktails, the author and his character displaying thereby</p>

  <p class="calibre1">an astonishing command of mushroomic esoterica; but mushrooms in this yarn</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were not the agent used for the murder.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The facts about lethal mushrooms are to be found, not in standard medical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reference works, but in mycological publications. They are well summarized in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">John Ramsbottom's <i class="calibre4">A Handbook of the Larger British Fungi,</i> an indispensable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reference book, which however still characterizes the amanita mappa (i. e., ci-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">trina) as poisonous, ignoring the work done by the French with this species.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Good case histories in English of poisoning by the deadly amanitas appear in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Canadian Government publication, <i class="calibre4">Mushrooms and Toadstools,</i> by H. T. Gtissow</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and W. S. Odell. Certainly the best worked up case history in any language</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is the account of the tragic end of a Madame Boyer and her daughter Elodie,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">more than a century ago, retold with dramatic suspense and pathos by Camille</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Fauvel in his delightful little book, <i class="calibre4">Le Champignon aui tue,</i> published in Paris in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1926. The best single source of information about all the toxic mushrooms is,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we believe, <i class="calibre4">Les Champignons Toxiques</i> (Paris, 1938), compiled jointly by Dr. R.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dujarric de la Riviere of the Pasteur Institute, and the mycologist Professor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Roger Heim. Dr. Dujarric de la Riviere's promising efforts to produce an anti-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toxin for the deadly amanita were interrupted by the second World War, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">intravenous injections of glucose are the only readily accessible palliative avail-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">able to physicians today.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mycologists are prone to exaggerate the importance of mushroom poisonings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in history. In their writings we repeatedly find a list of eminent persons who have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">died allegedly from eating poisonous mushrooms, a list that they copy from each</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other without verification. Sometimes we read that Euripides lost his wife and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">two daughters thus, an assertion unsupported by any ancient text, apparently</p>

  <p class="calibre1">based on a misreading of Athenaeus. We read that Pope Clement VII - he who</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is remembered chiefly for his troubles with Henry VIII of England - was a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">victim of poisonous mushrooms. This Pontiff died on September 25, 1534. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">52</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUSHROOMS FOR MURDERERS</p>

  <p class="calibre1">date falls in the season of the deadly amanita, but the records show that Cle-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ment's symptoms first manifested themselves many months earlier, on May 30,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the course of his fluctuating illness from that moment is well documented.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We discover in the record no trace of the telltale stigmata. As his biographer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Emmanuel Rodocanachi wisely observes, "In accordance with the custom of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">those times, people attributed his death to poison."1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">More remarkable still is the persistence in mycological writings of the asser-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion that Tsar Alexis of Russia or his widow died from mushrooms. Sometimes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the texts name him, but more often her. As to the Tsar himself, the circumstances</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of his death are well known and are unrelated to fungi. His widow was an out-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">standing woman, the mother of Peter the Great, Natalija Naryshkina by name.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She died on January 25,1694 (Russian style), after an illness of five days. Neither</p>

  <p class="calibre1">contemporary records nor the historians of the period tell us the nature of her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ailment. If mushrooms were the cause, they must have been dried or pickled spe-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cimens from the previous autumn. What has given rise to the tradition among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycologists that mushrooms brought about her end ? We believe the source is to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be found in a footnote that appears on page in of Jean-Jacques Paulet's classic</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Traits, des Champignons,</i> published in Paris in 1793, reading as follows:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">L'accident arrive a la veuve du czar Alexis, qui s'empoisonna avec des champignons</p>

  <p class="calibre1">qu'on avait gardes pour le careme, et rapporte par Miiller, est de notre siecle.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The accident that befell the widow of the Tsar Alexis, who was poisoned by mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms that had been set aside for Lent, as reported by Miiller, belongs to our century.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Miiller to whom reference is made can only be Gerhard Friedrich Miiller,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a prolific i8th century writer about Russia who died in 1783. But his numerous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">works available to us make no mention of the death of Natahja Naryshkina,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Paulet's footnote remains uncorroborated.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Finally there was the case of the German Emperor Charles VI, father of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Maria Theresa of Austria. He had been worried and run down. "On the loth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[of October] at night his complaint was increased by an indigestion, occasioned</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_25">CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">are compatible with poisoning by the deadly amanita. There were no allegations</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the poisoning, if such it was, was deliberate. If fungi were the agent, he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is the one modern personage thus killed. His end precipitated war and Voltaire</p>

  <p class="calibre1">declared that "a pot of mushrooms changed the history of Europe".</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So much for the famous men and women whose deaths have been attributed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rightly or wrongly to mushrooms. This mortuary procession of alleged mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">roomie victims would be incomplete if we did not here add the murders revealed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by 1'afFaire Girard. In this case, the victims were persons of no consequence:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their very names are forgotten. But the circumstances that brought them to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their deaths are, for mycophiles and epicures of crime, both instructive and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fascinating.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The standard mushroom manuals of France, like those of England, have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">always been saturated with mycophobic caution. By overstating the toxic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dangers of various species, they have aimed at assuring the safety of their readers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But, through a strange conjuncture of events, that very bias once contributed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the disastrous end of a man who trusted his mushroom manual too much.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This is the lesson to be learned from Faffaire Girard.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Girard's murders would doubtless have drawn wide attention if the press</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stories had not broken at the precise moment of the great spring offensive of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1918, the final year of the first World War. Girard was a Parisian, and his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">accomplices were his wife and his mistress. He murdered only his friends, after</p>

  <p class="calibre1">insuring their lives in his own favor. Poisons were his instrument, and among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other poisons he used toadstools gathered for him in the forest of Rambouillet</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by an old hobo known as le pere Theo, whose testimony later was damning to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">accused. From time to time Girard would order from Theo a mess of amanitas:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they had to have white gills, veil, and volva - the stigmata of the deadly ama-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nita, but also of the amanita mappa or citrina. Girard and his wife would serve</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these fungi to their victims at sumptuous dinners in their own apartment.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sometimes the guest went home and died, but on other occasions, doubtless</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the surprise and discomfiture of the Girards, the intended victim suffered no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ill effects whatever! Indeed, a number of them lived to give their evidence to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the police.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In 1918 the standard mushroom manual of France was Paul Dumee's. Like</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all of the over-cautious manuals of that time, it condemned the amanita citrina</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as deadly. Girard had not thought it necessary, therefore, to distinguish the two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amanitas when instructing old Theo about the mushrooms to gather. Thus it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">came about that when Theo brought in a mess of the amanita phalloides, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">victim would enjoy a dish of tasty mushrooms and later die. But when Theo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">54</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUSHROOMS FOR MURDERERS</p>

  <p class="calibre1">produced specimens of the innocent amanita citrina, the intended victim must</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have found them a little unpleasant to the taste, and that was the end of the matter.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the deadly amanita makes a delectable dish, whereas its relative the innocent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">citrina scarcely rises palate-wise to the mediocre level.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thus it may be said that Girard was deceived and misled by Dumee's over-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cautious manual, with the result that some of his friends and intended victims</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unwittingly survived his honest efforts to do them in, and he in turn was fatally</p>

  <p class="calibre1">entangled in the law's toils. Now that the French manuals have improved,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Girard's mistake is unlikely to be repeated. Had Girard hailed from Serignan,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Henri Fabre's village in the Provence, he would have known from childhood</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not to rely on Dumee, for these peasants need no manuals.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Girard's crimes would have been forgotten, had it not happened that Camille</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Fauvel, that prodigious mycophile, was a <i class="calibre4">Commissaire de Police</i> in Paris at the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">time, and though he was not handling the Girard case, having lately been charged</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the more famous and important but less interesting Mata Hari dossier,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he followed it with expert attention, even interviewing Girard in Fresnes prison</p>

  <p class="calibre1">after the conviction, in the interests of mycological lore. Fauvel published an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">admirable narrative of the affair many years later, in the <i class="calibre4">Supplement</i> to the issues</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of June and August, 1936, of the <i class="calibre4">Revue de Mycologie,</i> and we have drawn our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">facts from his account. It should be added that Girard died in his prison bed of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tuberculosis a few days after he was interviewed, never having admitted his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">guilt nor that he had relied on the unsound advice of Dumee. But Fauvel's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inference is based upon evidence that leaves little room for doubt.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">All that we have set forth in this chapter up to now - the description of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the singular properties of lethal mushrooms, the inadequacy of mystery writers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when they deal with this theme, our comments on alleged poisonings of eminent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">personages and the niushroomic murders of unimportant folk-has had only one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">purpose: to equip the reader for a reconsideration of the death of the Emperor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Claudius in A.D. 54. On that occasion, for once in the course of recorded history,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the whole of a great Empire and the known world swung on a dish of mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms. The accounts in the ancient writings of that famous event are an old,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">old story, familiar to all students of antiquity. Those texts have been parsed by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">students, dissected by historians, pondered by moralists for close on to twenty</p>

  <p class="calibre1">centuries. It would seem that by now every conceivable interpretation must</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have been hit upon, and the resources of scholarly inquiry exhausted. Indeed,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the signs of exhaustion are not lacking: in our own generation Guglielmo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ferrero in his <i class="calibre4">The Women of the Ccesars</i> has not only struggled to exonerate</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_61"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_26">CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Agrippina of the dreadful charge laid at her door, but to portray her as a noble</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Roman matron!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It would be surprising if at this late date fresh evidence shedding light on Clau-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dius's death were discovered, and yet this is what we think we have done. We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rely solely on the same worn texts, and we entrust our fate to the verdict of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scholars far more learned than we. Perhaps those old texts have a message to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">deliver to us that can be discerned only by one who is a lover of mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a physician, and above all an amateur of venomy - amateur in the sense of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">critical but passive observer of those who have practiced that subtile art.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Let us recall the background of the crime. Claudius succeeded Caligula as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">emperor in the year 41, at the age of 51. By his third wife, Messalina, he had had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a son, Britannicus, born the year before his accession. After executing Messa-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lina for adultery, he married his niece Agrippina, who by a previous marriage</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had a son of her own, three years senior to Britannicus; and her son was destined</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to worldly immortality as the Emperor Nero. Indeed, Agrippina's motive in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">murdering her husband was to assure the succession to Nero, in which endeavor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">success crowned her efforts. Claudius at the time of his death was said to be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">favoring Britannicus, and it was even rumored that he had bequeathed the Empire</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to Britannicus in a will that Agrippina destroyed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The young man who was to be known as Nero had as his tutor from A.D. 50</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the famous Seneca, and at the time of the crime Seneca was an intimate of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the imperial circle, privy to all that went on. He could have left us an eye-witness</p>

  <p class="calibre1">account of what happened, but instead he veils his remarks in satire - a prudent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evasion of one who undoubtedly knew too much. Three of the ancient historians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have given us accounts of the event. Tacitus, who was probably born in the year</p>

  <p class="calibre1">after Claudius's death, wrote his narrative about sixty years later; Suetonius's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">version came a few years after that; and Dio Cassius told the story again almost</p>

  <p class="calibre1">two centuries after the event. These three secondary sources differ among them-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">selves in details, which gives to their agreement on essentials a stamp of veri-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">similitude. In the main they were not copying each other, and they probably</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had the important facts right.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Claudius was exceedingly fond of mushrooms <i class="calibre4">(boleti),</i> and a plausible tradition</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has it that his favorite kind was what we know today as the amanita caesarea.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The dish of mushrooms that he ate on the fateful day consisted of <i class="calibre4">poisoned,</i> not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">poisonous, mushrooms. On this all three of the ancient historians agree, in dif-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ferent words. None identifies the poison that was used, but they are abundantly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clear that poison was added to the Emperor's favorite dish. Here is Tacitus, Book</p>

  <p class="calibre1">XII, Chap. Ixvii of the <i class="calibre4">Annals</i> in the Loeb edition:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">delectabili cibo boleto venenum.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So notorius, later, were the whole proceedings that authors of the period have recorded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the poison was sprinkled on an exceptionally fine mushroom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Suetonius gives alternative versions, in Book V, Chap, xliv, in the Loeb edition:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Et veneno quidem occisum convenit; ubi autem et per quern dato, discrepat. Quidam</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tradunt epulanti in arce cum sacerdotibus per Halotum spadonem prsegustatorem; alii</p>

  <p class="calibre1">domestico convivio per ipsam Agrippinam, quae boletum medicatum avidissimo ciborum</p>

  <p class="calibre1">talium optulerat.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That Claudius was poisoned is the general belief, but when it was done and by whom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is disputed. Some say that it was his taster, the eunuch Halotus, as he was banqueting on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Citadel with the priests; others that at a family dinner Agrippina served the drug to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">him with her own hand in mushrooms, a dish of which he was extravagantly fond.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Suetonius places the poisoned mushrooms only in his second version, but mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms could have been the vehicle that Halotus used too, and this may be im-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">plied. Dio Cassius comes down to us in a Greek summary. In Book LXI he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">accuses Agrippina of having put the poison into "one of the vegetables called</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms", using for mushroom the Greek word μύκης. A few pages later</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dio Cassius refers again to the same poison when he says:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Agrippina was ever ready to attempt the most daring undertakings; for example, she</p>

  <p class="calibre1">caused the death of Marcus Junius Silanus, sending him some of the poison with which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">she had treacherously murdered her husband.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">What poison did Agrippina use? We think the answer is clear. She turned for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">advice and aid to a woman named Locusta, an experienced artist in the prepa-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ration of poisons, as Tacitus tells us; a famous dealer in poisons, as Dio Cassius</p>

  <p class="calibre1">puts it. According to Tacitus, the instructions of the Empress to Locusta were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">narrowly defined. The poison was not to be sudden and instantaneous in its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">operation, lest the desperate achievement should be discovered. On the other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hand, if the effect were slow and consuming, Claudius as his end approached</p>

  <p class="calibre1">might discover the treachery and take steps to thwart the perpetrators in their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ultimate purposes. (He might, that is to say, proclaim Britannicus as his heir.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Something subtle was needed, which would take time but also deprive the victim</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of his faculties. As Tacitus goes on to say, by Locusta's skill the desired poison</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was prepared. This passage in the <i class="calibre4">Annals</i> of Tacitus being a crux in our argument,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we give it in full:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">57</p>

  <p class="calibre1">C H A P T E R F O U R</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Turn Agrippina sceleris olim certa et oblatas occasionis propera nee ministrorum egens,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">de genere veneni consultavit, ne repentino et praecipiti facinus proderetur; si lentum et</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tabidum delegisset, ne admotus supremis Claudius et dolo intellecto ad amorem filii re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">diret. Exquisitum aliquid placebat, quod turbaret mentem et mortem differret.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was then that Agrippina, long since bent upon the impious deed, and eagerly seizing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the present occasion, well furnished too as she was with wicked agents, deliberated upon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the nature of the poison she would use, whether, "if it were sudden and instantaneous in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its operation, the desperate achievement would not be brought to light: if she chose ma-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terials slow and consuming in their operation, whether Claudius, when his end approached,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and perhaps having discovered the treachery, would not resume his affection for his son."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Something of a subtle nature was therefore resolved upon, "such as would disorder his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">brain and require time to kill." [Oxford translation, <i class="calibre4">Annals,</i> Book xn, Chap. 66]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was only one poison available to the ancients that would fulfill Agrip-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pina's requirements - the poison of the deadly anianita. The victim would not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">give away the game by any abnormal indisposition at the meal, but when the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seizure came, he would be so severely stricken that thereafter he would no longer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be in command of his own affairs. For one familiar with the properties of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amanita phalloides the text in Tacitus seems transparently clear. But for others</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than mycophiles there might remain a doubt: is it legitimate for us to infer that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Locusta knew the deadly amanita and its secret virtue to which even now, after</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nineteen centuries, few are privy?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This question troubled and challenged us, not because we were uncertain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but because it would be hard to carry conviction with an uninitiated public.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Once more we reviewed all the principal sources, all the stray allusions in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">classical writers. We concentrated especially on Seneca. After all, he was a wit-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ness whose testimony would have been competent in our own courts of justice;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he was articulate, and had he not carried the secret etched sharp in his memory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from that fateful October day in A.D. 54 until his death eleven years later?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Somewhere, if only by inadvertence, he must have talked, and perhaps his reveal-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing words had survived, their esoteric meaning hitherto unperceived. We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">embarked on a reading of ah1 his extant writings. We began with his later works,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">composed after the death of the Emperor, and tried to orient each sentence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toward that event. Suddenly one day we came upon the tell-tale phrase: it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">leaped at us from the page, fairly shouting at us. Yes, whether with sly intention</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or by inadvertence, Seneca had blurted out the fateful secret, imparting it to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all knowing readers. And before us not a single commentator had ever caught</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the inner meaning of the plain words.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We refer the reader to Letter xcv that the old Stoic wrote to his friend Luci-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">58</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUSHROOMS FOR MURDERERS</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lius nine or ten years after the death of the Emperor and one or two years before</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he took his own life on Nero's orders. In it he describes and deplores the excesses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Roman upper class. He refers to the late Emperor's gluttony:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Di boni, quantum hominum unus venter exercet! Quid 2 Tu illos boletos, voluptarium</p>

  <p class="calibre1">venenum, nihil occulti operis iudicas facere, etiam si prsesentanei non fuerunt.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Good gods! What a number of men does one belly employ! But can you think those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms (a tasty poison) do not secretly and gradually operate, though no bad effect is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">immediately perceived from them ? [Loeb translation]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here is proof that Seneca knew the amanita phalloides. The period of silent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">invasion, that <i class="calibre4">veritable signature</i> of the lethal mushroom, was familiar to him,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and he even took pains to mention how tasty the wicked mushroom was! How</p>

  <p class="calibre1">much guilty knowledge packed into a few words! Read in conjunction with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Empress Agrippina's instructions to Locusta, we believe it clinches our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">case. The poison in the dish of Caesar's amanitas was the poison of the deadly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amanita. Two of our authors, Suetonius and Tacitus, give us grounds for sup-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">posing that the administration of the poison was entrusted to the eunuch Halotus,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whose office it was to taste the Emperor's food before serving it to him. Tacitus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">says that Halotus poured the poison into the dish of mushrooms. It would have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been easy for Locusta to prepare a sauce from the deadly specimens, and by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">enlisting the aid of Halotus, no suspicion would be aroused by the failure to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">serve it to others at the feast. However, this is a detail, important at the time</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the participants of course, but secondary to the primary fact that the ancient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">writers are telling us exactly how Locusta handled the assignment with which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Agrippina charged her. We believe that the secret of those two fearless and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wicked women is withheld from us no longer. (For Latinists and mycologists</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it is interesting to note that Seneca uses the word <i class="calibre4">boletus</i> for the deadly amanita:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it was clearly the term for all amanitas, not merely the amanita cassarea.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We rest our case on the knowledge shown by Seneca and the quoted passage</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from Tacitus, taken together. But there is additional circumstantial evidence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">compatible with our theory. The crime was committed on October 12 - in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">season when the deadly amanita could be easily found around Rome. On the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">morrow after Claudius had eaten the mushrooms and while he was yet alive,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">comedians were introduced into his presence to solace and delight him, as Sue-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tonius says. Since any such kind intention was foreign to Agrippina's nature,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and <i class="calibre4">a fortiori</i> at the dreadful moment that we are considering, we may assume</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that her purpose was different: the comic actors were to bear witness in the public</p>

  <p class="calibre1">market-place that the Emperor had not been killed but was in truth desperately</p>

  <p class="calibre1">59</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_63"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_27">CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">ill, and the Hippocratic facies that we know he must have manifested gave them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">full warranty for such a report. Immediately after Claudius's death, he was pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">claimed a god-a posthumous honor for emperors to which Romans were accus-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tomed. Afterwards, when Nero was in secure possession of his imperial office,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he was present at a certain banquet where mushrooms were brought in, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">someone remarked that they were the gods' food, <i class="calibre4">cibus deorum.</i> To this Nero is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">said to have replied: "True enough: my father was made a god by eating a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom." (This story is told by Suetonius, Dio Cassius, and Petrus Patricius.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nero's remark is more apt if he was referring to the deadly amanita, and not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">merely to a dish of edible mushrooms that had been poisoned; and Nero was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in a position to know.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In spite of Locusta's artistry, we know that her bold stroke was botched, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this leads us to the second part of the crime. The time schedule alone tells us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that something went awry. Claudius sat down to his fatal banquet at about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2.30 p.m. on October 12. At or shortly after noon the next day he was dead.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The lethal amanitas do not kill so quickly. We do not know at what stage in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the lengthy banquet he ate his mushrooms, but probably not at the beginning.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His seizure could not have taken place before 9 p.m., and probably not before</p>

  <p class="calibre1">midnight or later, which would mean that his agony lasted only twelve hours!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On its face this is impossible. We pointed out earlier that, for a murderer, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amanita phalloides labors under one defect: occasionally a victim recovers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Agrippina could not afford this risk, and even if we had no evidence to support</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our theory, we might assume that she and Locusta, as their imperial patient lay</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at their mercy, resorted to direct methods to dispatch him. Fortunately, our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">texts come to our help.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"The victim of the plot," says Dio Cassius, "was carried from the banquet</p>

  <p class="calibre1">apparently quite overcome by strong drink, a thing that had happened many</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times before." Suetonius's version is hesitant: "Of those accidents also which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ensued hereupon [after eating the mushrooms] the report is variable. Some say</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that straight upon the receipt of the poison he became speechless, and continuing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all night in dolorous torments died a little before day. Others affirm that at first</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he fell asleep, and afterwards, as the meat flowed and floated aloft, vomited all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">up." (If it is true that in his usual drunken stupor he threw up, this was enough</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to send the two women into a panic, for he might have rid himself of the fungal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">poison!) Tacitus is explicit: "Agrippina therefore became dismayed; but as her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">life was at stake, she thought little of the odium of her present proceedings, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">called in the aid of Xenophon the physician, whom she had already implicated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in her guilty purposes. It is believed that he, as if he purposed to assist Claudius</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in his efforts to vomit, put down his throat a feather besmeared with deadly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">poison; not unaware that in desperate villainies the attempt without the deed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is perilous, while to insure the reward they must be done effectually at once."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There was thus a second poisoning, with the Greek physician Xenophon repla-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cing Locusta. Suetonius says that, according to one report, the second poisoning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was by clyster.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">What was that poison to which Xenophon had hurried recourse? Robert</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Graves in private correspondence offers us an answer that fits the circumstances</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perfectly. Not long after Claudius's death, Seneca published a satire on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">emperor's deification to which he gave the title of <i class="calibre4">Apocolocyntosis,</i> an artificial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word telescoping <i class="calibre4">apotheosis</i> and <i class="calibre4">colocynthis.</i> The colocynth (as we call this gourd</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in English) is far from being a pumpkin, and the traditional translation of this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">title, the <i class="calibre4">Pumpkinification</i> of Claudius, is indeed as insipid as the classical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scholars have considered it. But if Mr. Graves is right, and we believe that he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is, the scholars have missed the point.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The colocynth is not edible. It is exceedingly bitter, whence its name, 'the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bitter gourd'. It is not native to Italy, but was imported from the arid areas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Near East, notably Palestine. This is the famous gourd that responded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to Elisha's miraculous powers in II Kings, Chapter 4, verses 38 to 41 :</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And Elisha came againe to Gilgal, and there was a dearth in the land, and the sonnes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Prophets were sitting before him: and hee said unto his seruant, Set on the great</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pot, and seethe pottage for the sonnes of the Prophets,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And one went out into the field to gather herbes, and found a wild vine, and gathered</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thereof wilde gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they knew them not.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So they poured out for the men to eat: and it came to passe as they were eating of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they could not eate thereof.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But he said, Then bring meale. And he cast it into the pot: And he said, poure out for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the people, that they may eat. And there was no harme in the pot.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In minimal doses the colocynth is a violent purgative; in larger doses it is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lethal. It happens that we know the history of this drug in surprising detail.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the first century of the Christian era the upper classes of Rome were much</p>

  <p class="calibre1">concerned with their health: hypochondriasis was rampant, and miracle drugs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were being discovered one after the other.1 Early in the reign of Claudius</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. Some of the drugs used in imperial Rome have survived iii use until recent times. One such is the agaric,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and another is colocynth, this latter having been the base for 'general issue" purgative pills in the British army</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the first world war. We too, in the mid-2Oth century, are witnessing a spate of miraculous pharmaceutical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discoveries. Will a single one of them be remembered in A.D. 3850?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">6l</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_65"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_28">CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">an apothecary named Scribonius Largus enjoyed immense vogue; possibly he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attended Messalina, the mother of Britannicus and predecessor of Agrippina as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wife of the Emperor. In the middle 40'$ of that century he assembled and pub-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lished a collection of prescriptions that was destined to become famous, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among them was a formula, or <i class="calibre4">hiera,</i> that he had discovered among the papers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a deceased colleague, Paccius Antiochus. One of its ingredients was colocynth,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a novel drug that thereupon quickly became the rage in the upper crust of Rome,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a few years before the events that we are discussing. In the desperate extrem-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ity of that turbulent night of October 12, A.D. 54, when the Greek physician</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Xenophon was called in consultation and permitted himself to become a <i class="calibre4">parti-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ceps criminis,</i> it was natural for him to come to the rescue of Locusta and Agrip-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pina by dispatching Claudius with an overdose of colocynth, administered by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mouth or clyster or both. This explains the name that Seneca gave to his satire.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Claudius's last words, as attributed to him by Seneca, were <i class="calibre4">Vce me! puto, con-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">cacavi me,</i> which would be apt for either colocynth or the deadly amanita.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If then our reading of the texts is right, Claudius was done in with a one-two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">knock-out, first a dose of the deadly amanita, and then a dose of colocynth. As</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a pun on 'apotheosis', the name of Seneca's satire <i class="calibre4">Apocolocyntosis</i> at last becomes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clothed with wit: the deification of an emperor is reduced to a repulsive scato-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logical metamorphosis. When, later, Agrippina did away with Marcus Junius</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Silanus (as Dio Cassius tells us), it was the deadly amanita that she used, and not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">colocynth; for colocynth proclaims its presence by its bitterness, and an intended</p>

  <p class="calibre1">victim would spew it out forthwith.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At noon on October 13 the gates of the imperial palace in Rome swung open,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Nero, then a youth of 17, emerged and presented himself as the new emperor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the army detachment that was on guard there. The Emperor Claudius was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dead, or <i class="calibre4">in extremis.</i> There could have been no reason, only danger, in prolonging</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the interval between the death of the old emperor and the assumption of autho-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rity by the new.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And so we bring our review of Claudius's death to an end. The three ancient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">historians who tell us the story were not clinicians. Their accounts, differing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sharply in the unessential details, give us a surprisingly clear and consistent overall</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clinical picture. This is circumstantial evidence of virtually conclusive weight</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that they were telling the truth. They could not severally have invented a com-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bination of symptoms, and a sequence of events, that two thousand years later</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would speak for themselves.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. For information concerning the early use of colocynth in Rome, the best source is Wilhelm Schonack's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scholarly study <i class="calibre4">Die Rezeptsammlung des Scribonius Largus,</i> published in Jena in 1912.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">6 2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUSHROOMS FOR MURDERERS</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our sources say that a curtain of secrecy had shrouded the palace during the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">illness of Claudius. It is tempting to try to reconstruct the scenes in the imperial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">palace before and during the crime. The plot had been laid earlier in whispered</p>

  <p class="calibre1">conversations between Agrippina and Locusta in some safe spot to which Lo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">custa had been furtively summoned. How stirred Locusta must have been by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">her great assignment: the world offered none bigger for a person in her line of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">work. Locusta, if she possessed imagination as well as art, may well have leaped</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with excitement at the thought that this deed, artfully accomplished, would bring</p>

  <p class="calibre1">her immortality; and indeed it has done so. But during that fateful night the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tension must have been unbearable. Had their victim foiled their efforts prema-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">turely from drunkenness, by vomiting before the poisonous amanita had done</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its damage? Might he survive and resume the exercise of his imperial functions?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Was Locusta vexed, her professional pride hurt, when Xenophon was called in,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or was she relieved ? With what anxious eyes Locusta and Agrippina must have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">searched each other's ill-lighted faces as the hours crept on! But in any case,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with his enemies in command at his bedside, Claudius stood no chance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The triumph of Agrippina and her fellow conspirators bestowed on them all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">power. They may well have gloated in their success, and were so situated that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they could talk with a large measure of impunity. In the writings of Seneca and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the three historians, one seems to hear echoes of veiled boasting, as though Lo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">custa and Agrippina were dying to tell just how they had contrived their ends.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Their words were veiled, in homage to virtue, but thinly, and lend themselves</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to understanding by the initiated, if only across a chasm of nineteen centuries.</p>
