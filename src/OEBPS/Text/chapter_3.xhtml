        <div class="main">
            <p><span class="initial">A</span>LL this talk of mushrooms would be idle, were the contrast between Russian and Anglo-Saxon attitudes a random thing. But these mushrooms hint at the a answer to bigger questions, far beyond food and cookery. A people who have always had an abundance of other foods are little tempted to brave the initial perils of the mushroom world. However, in the desperate exigencies of all-out war, of chronic war through decades and generations and centuries, of defensive warfare with homes ravaged and farms left untended, where the unslaughtered remnants of the population hide from the pitiless invader in woods and swamps and fields &#8212;&#8203; under these conditions, I suggest, men and women will discover the humble mushroom, and will prove the various kinds by trial and error, and make friends among them in time of need. For mushrooms, springing up almost overnight, will be God&#8217;s manna to a people driven from their homes into the wilderness. And the knowledge thus gained, joined with emotions of gratitude born of the circumstances, will not be soon lost. During the blessed intervals of peace when the fields yield their normal increase, the various mushrooms, along with the wild berries and fruits and the cultivated crops, will be assigned in men&#8217;s minds their appointed stations in the annual procession of the seasons, and will be clothed with fond associations, and in every kitchen, on every stove, sundry ways will be devised to bring out the virtue peculiar to each friendly kind. There is an old belief in Russia that when mushrooms abound, war is in the offing. The thoughtless intellectuals of the world despise such homely sayings, which on the surface are nonsense. But ofttimes those sayings are the cryptic expression of experience graven deep in the recesses of a people&#8217;s past. Mushrooms are not harbingers of war: it is the other way round. When the dogs of war are running loose across the fair countryside of Russia, the people, hard-pressed, know that <a name="famine">mushrooms may soon be their mainstay</a>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp3-fn2" id="cp3-r2">[2]</a></sup> Our theory finds disturbing support in a book published in Prague just as the Communist curtain was about to descend on that city. The book dealt with Czech folk food. A peasant speaking of a mushroom called <i>horyl</i> (from <i>hořeti,</i> &#8216;to burn&#8217;), said that it burnt the mouth even when thrice boiled, yet in the &#8216;great hungers&#8217; it was always eaten, and when hunger and the pest would return, again it would be eaten.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp3-fn3" id="cp3-r3">[3]</a></sup></p>

            <p>This link between war and mushrooms can be detected, albeit faintly, in the Anglo-Saxon world. It is said that during the final phases of the American Civil War the people in the devastated stretches of the South turned to mushrooms for sustenance. Certain it is that a famous botanist living at that time in the Carolinas, the Rev. M. A. Curtis, wrote how &#8220;during the late war I paid no attention to Botany, except to the edible mushrooms, from which I have gotten many a substantial and luxurious meal.&#8221;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp3-fn4" id="cp3-r4">[4]</a></sup> He gladly shared his esoteric lore with the neighbors, who, food being scarce, were apt pupils, and such was his success that he embarked on a book to spread the useful tidings. It was to be called <i>Mycophagia Americana</i>, but by the time it was ready, the war was over and publishers were not interested.</p>

            <p>In England during the recent war there were public and private efforts to increase the consumption of wild fungi. We know one elderly Russian lady who for a time made good money gathering <i>belye griby</i> on Wimbledon Common, in full sight of the wondering English. She pickled or precooked them and sold them to a fashionable restaurant. But, although England&#8217;s peril was acute, there was, as things turned out, little actual hunger; and furthermore, when measured against the long history of a people, the crisis was brief. The times were not bad enough for mushrooms to take hold. Today there are those who fear that England&#8217;s bitterest trials lie ahead, in her peace-time efforts to feed herself. If chronic want, real want, should for the first time in history beset the English people, there will be the mushrooms to turn to, and a precious reserve they will prove to be.</p>
            
            <p>More than a century ago a famous French chef, Louis Eustache Ude, propounded an ingenious and amusing theory to explain the lackadaisical attitude of the English toward food and cookery &#8212;&#8203; an ingenious theory it was, but, as I shall show, completely unsound. He began by denouncing physicians as &#8216;enemies of the art&#8217; of cooking, and then he went on:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>I am greatly concerned at being obliged to combat a still more powerful, though amiable, enemy to Cookery. The Ladies of England are unfavorably disposed toward our art; yet I find no difficulty in assigning the cause of it. It is particularly the case with them (and indeed it is so in some measure with our own sex) that they are not introduced to their parents&#8217; table till their palates have been completely benumbed by the strict diet observed in the nursery and the Boarding Schools.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp3-fn5" id="cp3-r5">[1]</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The baneful influence of the nursery and the boarding school is doubtless all that the author said, but one would have liked to remind the great Maître that the rudiments of any distinguished cuisine grow out of the people, the whole people, and nothing but the people; that the leisure class merely spin refinements for the most democratic of the arts; and that the people by and large have never known either nursery or boarding school. If the English in general seem to the rest of us indifferent to good food, and some of them even disapproving of the fine art of pleasing the palate &#8212;&#8203; if the English bill of fare lacks variety and the good ingredients are spoiled in preparation &#8212;&#8203; these shortcomings of a noble people must go back to deeper, broader causes than the child-life of the well-to-do. For a thousand years England never knew war &#8212;&#8203; war as others and especially the Russians suffered it &#8212;&#8203; and England has never known prolonged, desperate want. Hardship is the school in which people forget food tabus, and acquire that deep reverence for food and its preparation that inspires a great cuisine. Everyone who knows anything about Russia will recall that simple and moving ceremony of hospitality in which bread and salt, symbols of food, are offered on a tray to the honored guest. That ceremony is an ancient, almost sacramental expression of reverence for food, and Russia&#8217;s history gives meaning to that reverence. In the Anglo-Saxon world only prolonged want will, some day perhaps, bring about a comparable respect for food. If England, that land unique in moral resources and spiritual unity, be destined to endure privation over the coming generations, the hardships will most certainly give birth to new and lustrous chapters in her history, chapters of stirring and triumphant drama &#8212;&#8203; and incidentally, I predict, they will bring about at last a worthy English cuisine.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the reader by now is protesting that I have overlooked England&#8217;s famous warrior past. Oh, yes, I know that her history is studded with decisive battles. Crécy and Blenheim and Trafalgar and Waterloo, glorious victories and sometimes glorious defeats. But they were all fought abroad, by a handful of men at sea or in other people&#8217;s homes. They were fought way down yonder among the heathen, somewhere off Florès in the Açorès. Those wars were like big-game hunting, stepped up another dimension. Of course there were civil wars also, back in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, and the 15<sup>th</sup>, and under King Stephen, and there were border frays along the way. But civil wars, however cruelly fought, lack the ultimate sting, for, whoever wins, members of the family retain possession of the homestead. No intruder takes over the patrimony. These comments about wars go for the United States too; broadly speaking, the tally until our own generation adds up to two civil wars (including the War of Independence) and a few brief expeditionary ventures.</p>

            <p>Yes, whoever seeks seriously to understand Russia must make the needed effort of intellect and imagination to comprehend the full and awful meaning of war in the history of the Slavs. This is the first and great imperative. (In the winter of 1939&#8211;&#8203;40, when the Finnish army seemed for a time to hold its own with heroic courage against the Russian forces, how often did my American friends remark to me that, after all, the Finnish successes were not surprising, since Russia had had no warrior past!) As compared with the West, and especially the English-speaking world, war for the Russians has been a calamity of a wholly different and greater order of magnitude. Pause for a moment and consider this. In the wide range of the English vocabulary are there words of more awful potency than &#8216;Huns&#8217; and &#8216;Tartars&#8217;? It was in the fourth century that the Huns burst like a rocket out of Asia into Europe, and the Mongol hordes followed them seven centuries later. This was all long ago and far away. The Huns in the end were stopped on the fields of France, and the Tartars never got into the West. Yet the mere names of these far-off peoples of ages past still trail clouds of terror in the minds of nations then unborn, in continents then unknown. The earliest description of the Tartars by an unidentified Englishman who sojourned among them will explain in some measure the fearful impact of that strange and pitiless people on the European mind:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>They be hardie and strong in the breast, leane and palefaced,
                    rough and hufshouldred, having flatte and short noses, long and
                    sharpe chinnes, their upper jawes are low and declining, their
                    teeth long and thinne, their eye-browes extending from their
                    foreheads down to their noses, their eies inconstant and blacke,
                    their countenances writhen and terrible, their extreame joynts
                    strong with bones and sinewes, having thicke and great thighes,
                    and short legs, and yet being equall unto us in stature: for
                    that length which is wanting in their legs is supplied in the
                    upper parts of their bodies. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp3-fn6" id="cp3-r6">[6]</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The Slavs, let us remember, met the Huns face to face, and the Russians bowed to the yoke of the Tartars for three full centuries. Nowadays we hear glib talk of &#8216;genocide&#8217;, a new word meaning the murder of a people; but the Slavs dwelt for centuries on the highways of the Great Migrations, and, had their powers of survival been less, they would have been absorbed or exterminated many times over. Other nations and tribes did disappear in the ethnic maelstrom of the Steppes.</p>

            <p>&#8217;Huns&#8217; and &#8216;Tartars&#8217; are not the only linguistic contribution to the West of the Asiatic invaders. No one knows for sure the origin of the word &#8216;ogre&#8217;; it probably comes to us from the people called Ugri, known to us as the Hungarians, who drove or were pushed into the Danubian plain in the 9<sup>th</sup> century. Our word &#8216;horde&#8217; comes from the language of the Tartars. For them (as for the Russians to this day) <i>ordá</i> is simply the headquarters of a marching host, and the Golden Horde was the supreme headquarters on the Volga of the Tartars who subjugated the Slavs of the steppes and of Moscow. In a lexicon that comes down to us from the library of the poet Petrarch (the <i>Codex Cumanicus)</i> we learn the curious fact that the Asiatic invaders referred to the Holy See of Rome as the Horde <i>(ordá)</i> of Christendom. The West in taking over the word changed its meaning to cover the swarms of ferocious invaders. In India the same word, now <i>Urdu,</i> came to mean the language of the nomad camps.</p>

            <p>The Steppes &#8212;&#8203; those moist, fertile plains that fan out to the north of the Black Sea &#8212;&#8203; are the monumental stage on which from the beginnings of history East and West have clashed, in an historical drama of epic grandeur. Like the whirling waters of a rising tide that contend from divers directions for the mastery of a level beach, through thousands of years a succession of migrating tribes from East and South and West have flowed into the Steppes, and overrun them, and battled with each other for possession; and then with the passing of time have vanished into the earth. In recent centuries the Turks made their vain bid for title; before them, the Tartars, speaking a kindred dialect. Before the Tartars came the Polovtsi, and before them the Pechenegs. These last-named warrior peoples are scarcely known to Westerners, but they left dreadful, indelible scars on Russian memories. Before them came out of Asia the hard-riding Avars, and before the Avars the Huns. The Avars and the Huns made general use of bridles, stirrups, and saddles. With their horses these mounted warriors revolutionized warfare, and rendered the famed Roman legion obsolete. Before the Huns, from the Baltic, there swept down into the Steppes and Crimea the Visigoths, the Ostrogoths, and the Goths. Those Goths were securely settled in the Crimea by 250 A.D., and there they lingered on for a thousand years. In the middle of the 16<sup>th</sup> century a famous traveler, de Busbecq, encountered in the Turkish dominions a few individuals who still could recall some words of their ancestral Teutonic tongue. And down even to our own days, in the Caucasus, there is a fair-haired people whose neighbors call them, erroneously, the Goths. Before the Goths, the Sarmatians, of Persian origin, ruled the Steppes for centuries, and before them the Scythians, who were dwelling in the land when the Greek historian Herodotus went sightseeing up the Dniepr River. And before the Scythians legend tells us of the shadowy Cimmerians.</p>

            <p>In thus spanning the millenniums we have omitted many famous peoples: the Scandinavians, who swept down from the North through the waterways of Russia to the very gates of Byzantium; the Greek and later the Italian colonial empires in the Black Sea; the Ugri or Magyars who crossed the Steppes to settle in what we call Hungary; the Bulgars who once dwelt in the Volga valley and now till their cherished Balkan soil; the strange and mighty Khazar Empire on the northern slopes of the Caucasus, whose sovereign had to be Jewish by religion; the Alani, and the Assi who gave their name to the Sea of Azov; and many another tribe of uncouth name &#8212;&#8203; the Utiguri, the Kutriguri, the Onoguri &#8212;&#8203; who lived out their day and vanished.</p>

            <p>Compared with those Homeric dramas of the past, how fleeting and insignificant was Hitler&#8217;s stab across the Steppes to Stalingrad. In the presence of those Great Migrations, the history of Western Europe, at least up to the Age of Exploration, seems to be acted out in miniature, and to give off a slightly foetid odor as of a hot-house. Viewed in the light of all human history, how unusual must be the introspective, intensively developed culture of the communities clustered along the Western fringes of the Eurasian Continent. The world is destined to devote ever more attention to the peoples of Eastern Europe and the Black Sea Basin, and if the West will unflex its intellectual muscles, and exercise its capacity for wonder, and lengthen the focus of its mental vision, what a panorama filled with color and drama will unroll itself!</p>

            <p>In the folds of the Caucasus mountains there dwell to this day a score of isolated peoples, with strange languages many of them as curious as the Basque of the Pyrenees. Like the Ark on neighboring Mount Ararat, these peoples have survived the floods of Indo-European and Turkish migrations. They are the ethnographic moraines of the world that was old before the Old World was born. Sarmatians, Scythians, and Cimmerians &#8212;&#8203; those ancient peoples are perhaps mere infants alongside these secluded tribes, whose secrets, if we but succeed in deciphering them, will make the millenniums seem like centuries. Little by little our scholars, in our own times, are piecing together the bits of evidence, and with their aid revising the perspectives in which we view both ancient Greece and Rome (and that means us their progeny also), against the background of earlier, Eastern cultures of unfathomed antiquity.</p>

            <p>The Black Sea is a deep basin. Its deeper waters are so infused with chemicals that they sustain no life, and are a graveyard for the detritus of human cultures that have passed away. Its stormy surface waters forever rotate in a counter-clockwise flow, suggestive of the human tides that have wheeled around its shores as around a hub from time immemorial. Behind Greece and Rome loom more and more, as our study of the past progresses, the cultures of the Black Sea basin; and the Black Sea becomes the enigmatic eye of history.</p>

            <p>The peoples of the Great Migrations erupted into the Steppes explosively, and then in course of time faded away. The Slavs followed different tactics. Their entrance on the stage of history was inconspicuous &#8212;&#8203; an odd thing for the Dramatist to have devised, when you consider the rôle they were destined to play. Emerging from the neighborhood of the Vistula, they stole imperceptibly into the consciousness of men. Perhaps they figure among the numerous tribes that Herodotus mentions, but he did not make the identification sure. Tacitus in 98 A.D. described the Slavs in his book on Germany, and that was their formal début in history. A few centuries later, they had spilled out into the Balkans, and by the 9<sup>th</sup> century the Russians emerge securely established in Kiev. They were a prolific tribe of farmers, spreading like wire-grass along the water-courses. Geographically they were of course European, as European as the Anglo-Saxons. They were European settlers reaching out to the Eastern frontier, and bearing the brunt of Asiatic attacks. (How ironic it must sound in Asiatic ears when uninformed Westerners decry the Slavs as &#8216;Asiatics&#8217;! In the course of ten centuries these European Slavs have pushed the Asiatics out of Europe, and then overrun their own vast Continent to the very shores of the Pacific.) Unlike the looting nomadic warriors from the East, they were a sedentary folk. They belonged to the land and the land belonged to them. There is evidence that in their pagan religion they deified the processes of nature, and above all their Moist Mother Earth. Their attachment to the fertile earth is a thing that Westerners, and especially the English-speaking world, can hardly grasp. The old religion perhaps still runs through their blood. It is the Russian in me that makes me love to plunge my bare hands in the moist warm fertile earth, mother earth, the earth that yields us our daily bread, the food that we reverence as a divine gift, that we worship in the Host. Perhaps we love our mushrooms the way we do because they seem the earthiest of nature&#8217;s growths. From those pagan times a thousand years ago down to now, the Russians feel themselves attached to the earth viscerally, as by an umbilical cord. In the early Slavonic chronicles the Russians are depicted always as farmers, not traders or warriors, and their enemies habitually took advantage of this dependence on the soil to attack their homesteads and villages at harvest time. The Slavs were already then old hands at taking refuge in the woods, just as in the recent war, and those were the circumstances under which, ages earlier, they must have first come into intimate communion with their friends the mushrooms. As the successive waves of nomads spent their initial force, the Slavs resumed their steady pressure and retook the beloved land and pushed on. They were the resistant, tenacious, pushing tortoise, and the invaders were the showy, easy-come-easy-go hares. The Slavs made some progress in the West also, and as late as a few centuries ago, the peasants in Holstein and on the Baltic island of Bornholm were still speaking a Slavic tongue. To this day the Slav-speaking Wends survive in villages south of Berlin. Many of the place-names of Germany are Slavic; Stettin means bristles, and it was the port through which this commodity was exported; and Pomerania is merely Pomorjane &#8212;&#8203; &#8216;inhabitants of the sea-shore&#8217;.</p>

            <p>The Russians today are a singularly uniform people, as compared with the extreme mixtures in Western Europe. The traits of the Russians are the traits of an Indo-European peasant people indigenous to Europe, first Christianized and civilized under Byzantine influences, and politically shaped by the stern necessity of waging incessant warfare on all sides for the sheer privilege of survival. It fell to them to occupy and defend a desirable land devoid of natural defenses, a rich, land-locked inheritance surrounded by covetous and arrogant enemies. One reason ofttimes given for the relative uniformity of the Russian people has been the absence of mountain barriers in their homeland: the geographical circumstances have encouraged a cultural and ethnic fluidity. But this explanation proves too much: for precisely the same reason they could have lost their identity in the vast steppes, exposed forever as they were to alien peoples on every side, tugging them in every dkection. They survived as a homogeneous ethnic group and a cultural entity because, for reasons deeply hidden in the racial strain, they chose to resist foreign encroachments. This struggle has been the theme of Russia&#8217;s history &#8212;&#8203; the continual temptation to assimilate foreign influences, leading to violent rejection in the interests of self-preservation, and ending in every instance with a deepened sense of their folk identity, but an identity molded by the ordeal of the never-ending struggle, molded positively by acceptance in some measure of foreign influences, and negatively by the self-inflicted effects of violent resistance.</p>


            <p>In one of the earliest accounts of Muscovy written by an Englishman, in Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s time, there is an observation concerning the Tsar&#8217;s wars that could have been repeated with other names at almost any other period:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>His enemies with whom he hath warres for the most part are these: &#8212;&#8203; Litto, Poland, Sweden, Denmarke, Lifland, the Crimmes, Nagaians, and the whole nation of the Tartarians, which are a stoute and a hardie people as any under the Sunne. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp3-fn7" id="cp3-r7">[7]</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>A Continental traveler, Sigismund von Herberstein, writing in Latin a half century earlier, had remarked of the Russians and their horses that &#8220;rest is seldom given them, for either they are waging war against the Lithuanians, or the Livonians, or the Swedes, or the Tartars of Cazan; or, if no war is going on, the prince generally appoints 20,000 men every year in places about the Don and the Occa, as guards to repress the eruptions and depredations of the Tartars of Precop.&#8221;</p>

            <p>We saw in the recent war the tough soldier that the Russian makes. His qualities were not born overnight, nor were they the fruit of a single generation. He was the heir to an old fighting tradition. Read, if you will, this account of the same soldier four centuries ago:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p> They are a kinde of people most sparing in diet, and most patient in extremitie of cold, above all others. For when the ground is covered with snowe, and is growen terrible and hard with the frost, this Russe hangs up his mantle, or souldiers coate, against that part from whence the winde and Snowe drives, and so making a little fire, lieth downe with his backe towards the weather: this mantle of his serves him for his bed, wall, house and all: his drinke is colde water of the river, mingled with oatemeale, and this is all his good cheere, and he thinketh himselfe well, and daintily fedde therewith, and so sitteth down by his fire, and upon the hard ground, rosteth as it were his wearie sides thus daintily stuffed: the hard ground is his feather bed, &amp; some blocke or stone his pillow: and as for his horse, he is as it were a chamberfellow with his master, faring both alike. How justly may this barbarous, and rude Russe condemne the daintinesse and nicenesse of our Captaines, who living in a soile &amp; aire much more temperate, yet commonly use furred boots and clokes?</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>It is safe to assume, I think, that this hardy Russ knew his mushrooms.</p>
