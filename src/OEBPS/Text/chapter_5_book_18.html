  <h2>18<br/>THE ANATOMY OF MYCOPHOBIA</h2>

  <section class="main">
      <p><span class="initial">I</span>n the course of these pages we have often spoken of the different emotional</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attitudes toward wild mushrooms that mark the members of the European</p>

  <p class="calibre1">family of peoples. Heirs of a common Indo-European culture, sharing the same</p>

  <p class="calibre1">linguistic heritage and folklore, their diversity of response to the fungi is amaz-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing, and, we must admit, baffling. Our information is insufficient in extent and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">precision for the compilation of a <i class="calibre4">carte mycophagique</i> of Europe. But by pulling</p>

  <p class="calibre1">together the threads of evidence available to us we may suggest what such a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">map would show, and draw attention to the curious traits that compose the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophobic syndrome.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the first place, the feelings of a people for wild mushrooms are unrelated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the supply. Wonderful mushrooms are abundant in both Norway and Mus-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">covy, but the mushroom lore of the Norwegians is poor. The Portuguese are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">almost as steeped in mycophobia as their neighbors in Castile, though Portugal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is by comparison rich in fungi. The Catalans live next door to the mycophobic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spaniards, and yet the Catalans are to be numbered amongst those rare peo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ples whose folk knowledge of the wild mushrooms is breath-taking in range</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and subtlety. But perhaps the classic illustration of the point we are making is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to be found outside Europe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Arabian desert is not a land that mushroom-eaters would think to visit</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on pilgrimage; nonetheless, we discover that the Bedouin are passionate myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">philes. An authority on the Arabian nomads, Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, men-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tions this repeatedly in his admirable work on <i class="calibre4">The Arab of the Desert,</i> and in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">letter to us he has nobly developed the theme. While the Arab eats various</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kinds of mushrooms with relish, the desert 'truffles' are his favorites. These fungal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">growths, which never emerge to the surface of the earth, are usually called</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'truffles' by Europeans, but in fact they belong to a different genus, the terfezia.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From classical times they have been esteemed in northern Africa, and in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">market of Damascus they are sold in quantity under the local name of <i class="calibre4">kame.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">According to Colonel Dickson, scattered over Northeast Arabia, on Bahrain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Island, and in the Qatar peninsula, there are spots well known to the Arabs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where terfezia grow, always in the company of the rug-rug bush, known to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">science as the helianthemum Lippi. The Arab cannot count on his mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He keeps on the lookout for heavy rainfalls in the <i class="calibre4">wasm</i> season, which corre-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sponds to our October, and if the rains then are heavy, and if they are accom-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">panied by thunder and lightning, and especially if the rains recur throughout</p>

  <p class="calibre1">335</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_118"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_59">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">winter and spring, then the Arab knows the year will be good for mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When the conditions are propitious, in February and March the black-tent folk</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strike their tents, and journey to the familiar places, and then the women and chil-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dren go forth early in the morning for the sunrise, or late in the day for sunset; and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the shepherd boys, out with their flocks, are on the lookout too. For as the slanting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rays of the twilight sun streak across the horizontal earth, the practiced eyes of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the women and children detect the slight shadows cast by the monticules that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the swelling terfezia are pushing up. During the spring months of a good year,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these growths are as satisfying as meat to the Bedouin. He eats them roasted in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hot ashes and dipped in salt, or fried slightly (after soaking in water with a pinch</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of salt) in clarified or fresh butter. The Arab women also slice them and dry</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them in the sun, and then keep them for eating in summer, or even for years</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as a food reserve. There are two kinds of these terfezia known to Colonel</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dickson, the white <i class="calibre4">zobaidi,</i> which are the best, and the <i class="calibre4">khlas,</i> smaller, brown,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and less tasty.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Europe is sharply polarized, mycophagously speaking. At opposing ends of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Continent there are two areas where the folk knowledge about mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is prodigious, sometimes truer than the manuals, and where the affection for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them is wide and deep. There are also two areas of Europe, poles apart, where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms are generally ignored or loathed. In between are all the other peo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ples, with varying degrees of knowledge and subtle gradations of feeling.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Great Russians are a mycolatrous folk, and of this some readers will</p>

  <p class="calibre1">consider our book manifest proof. The Poles, the Slovaks, and the Czechs are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ardent mycophiles, and are sure to resent as an impudent and even imperialistic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pretension my view that the Great Russians are in a class by themselves in this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">respect. I have never heard a contemptuous remark about mushrooms from a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Great Russian; I recall none in our literature. But on an earlier page we have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seen what Poland's greatest poet says. The Czechs know their mushrooms like</p>

  <p class="calibre1">few others; but why are they in deadly dread of the boletus satanas &gt; This is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom that, properly cooked, strong stomachs can tolerate; yet the Czechs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shun it like the deadly amanita. Our neighbors the Lithuanians are great mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room eaters. I do not know enough about them to give them a rating. Is their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">appetite for mushrooms indigenous or borrowed from the Slavs &gt; Here is a pretty</p>

  <p class="calibre1">problem to be coolly considered. It is certain that the interest in mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among the Slavs slides off as one goes South. The Ukranians show less interest,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the Balkan Slavs are almost apathetic; it is said that the monastic clergy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Rumania and the other Balkan countries maintain a mycophagous tradition</p>

  <p class="calibre1">well above the level of the surrounding peasantry.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">336</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE ANATOMY OF MYCOPHOBIA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Finns present an interesting pattern. By tradition mycophobes, they still</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reject most mushrooms. But over much of the country they have learned from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Russians to eat lactarii, and in Carelia, where Russians used to go on vaca-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tions, they know and love many species. In the south-west there is a small area</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where only the chanterelle is eaten - clearly a cultural emanation from Sweden.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The focus of mycophagy in the West lies in that stretch of Mediterranean lit-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toral which embraces Catalonia and the Provence. In what is perhaps the best</p>

  <p class="calibre1">list of vernacular names for mushrooms ever assembled, the Catalan savants</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Joaquim Codina and P. Font Quer brought together a vocabulary of about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">220 words, all of them genuine, identified with the localities where they were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">heard.2 The country folk of Provence are similarly proficient in mushroomic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lore. Whether this intensive mycophilic knowledge prevails west of the Rhone</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in Roussillon, thus linking Provence with Catalonia, we do not know.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Just as Muscovy and Catalonia may be taken as the citadels of mycophagy,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so as to mycophobia the foci of infection are found on the one hand among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Celts and Frisians along the shores of the Atlantic and the North Sea, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the other hand in Greece. The Greeks have always been mycophobes. All</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the early Greek poets - Homer through the dramatists - ignore the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms. The earliest references to them are in the fifth century, and, as is fitting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in a mycophobic world, both refer to poisonings.3 Next we encounter Ni-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kander of Colophon, the didactic poet of the 2nd century B.C. whom we have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">already cited. In his <i class="calibre4">Alexipharmaca</i> he speaks thus of the mushroom tribe:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Let not the evil ferment of the soil injure a man; it will often swell up in his chest, at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other times it will choke him, when it is fostered over the viper's coil deep in its lair,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sucking up the monster's venom and the noxious breath from its moutn. This is the evil</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ferment which they call Fungi in general. [Quoted by courtesy of Cambridge University</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Press from translation by A. S. F. Gow and A. F. Scholfield]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">From beginning to end in the writings of the ancient Greeks we find not one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">enthusiastic word for mushrooms. Even Athenaeus, that addict to the fleshpots</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whose lengthy writings give us an invaluable picture of daily life in ancient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greece, was no friend of the mushroom world. "Mushrooms grow on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ground," he said, "and few of them are edible. Most of them cause death by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">choking." The botanist Theophrastus was incompetent in his discussions of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungi, and while Dioscorides and Galen were better, many of their observations</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. The Finnish attitude toward mushrooms is discussed in detail in Toivo Rautavaara's <i class="calibre4">Suomen Sienisato,</i> pub</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lished in Helsinki; for English summary see pp. 420-1.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. See the botanical journal <i class="calibre4">Cavanillesia,</i> vol. m, Barcelona, 1931.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3. Athenaeus quotes Eparchides concerning a tragic episode that came to the attention of Euripides. The other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">early reference is in Hippocrates, <i class="calibre4">Epidemicorum,</i> Book vn, par. 102.</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_120"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_60">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">were grossly inaccurate, and they are interesting on this subject chiefly for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">further proof they offer that the Greeks were mycophobes. To this day the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greeks pay no attention to wild mushrooms, like the English eating only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the psalhota campestris, which they call μανιτάρι, a word descended from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">classical άμανῖται.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We believe that this mycophobia of the Greeks holds the key to the meaning,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hitherto unperceived, of a famous anecdote about Nero that Suetonius recorded.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Suetonius, writing a half century after the event, accused Nero of having been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">privy to the murder of Claudius, supporting his charge by an inference: 'for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nero used afterwards to laud mushrooms, the vehicle in which the poison was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">administered to Claudius, as gods' food <i class="calibre4">[deorum cibum],</i> as the Greek proverb</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has it.' This witticism, alluding to the posthumous deification of Claudius, is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stale now from age and repetition, but thanks to it we possess a Greek saying no-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where else recorded. Dio Cassius told the same story later, and later still we find</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it in the writings of Petrus Patricius, a contemporary of Belisarius,2 who adds a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">telling detail. When the mushrooms came on, a guest remarked that they were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gods' food, θεῶν βρῶμα. This gave Nero his opening, and how the murderous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">implications of his retort must have chilled the sycophantic company! What did</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Greeks mean by 'gods' food' ? Certainly not 'food fit for the gods', which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would have called for different phrasing. Robert Graves suggests an answer.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We know from Pliny that in the fashionable circles of Rome mushrooms were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all the rage. But not so with the Greeks. It was surely a mycophobic Greek</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who interposed the Greek saying when he saw the mushrooms arrive, just as an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Englishman on the Continent turns from a dish of morels because for him they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are toadstools, or just as a Fleming in former times would have scorned <i class="calibre4">duivels-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">brood,</i> 'devils' bread'. 'Gods' food' and 'devils' bread', in their innermost meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are synonyms, verbalizing the ancient tabu. We suggest that they go back to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">time when the divine mushroom was holy and therefore unclean for all save</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the king-priest.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In one striking respect the lands of extreme mycophilia and extreme myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phobia are alike: they are equally free of mushroom poisonings. Your Frisians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">never die from toadstools, for they never touch any wild fungi. And your Pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ven^al villagers are equally safe, for they know which to eat. Henri Fabre in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. On Mount Athos Russian and Greek monastic communities have lived in close proximity for centuries. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Eastern Church the dietary rules and customs of the monks play a big role, and it would be interesting to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">learn how the addiction of the Russian monks to mushrooms has affected their mycophobic Greek brethren.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have done our utmost, by correspondence, to arrive at the facts concerning this cultural tide-rip on Mount</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Athos, but without success: the good monks seem unable to enter into the spirit of our humanistic inquiry.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. The three versions of the episode are to be found in the Loeb editions of Suetonius and Dio Cassius.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">338</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE ANATOMY OF MYCOPHOBIA</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Life of the Fly</i> tells us that during his thirty years in the Proven9al village of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Serignan, he had never heard of even the mildest indisposition from mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and this in face of the fact that his neighbors habitually ate many species described</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the manuals of the day as poisonous or suspect! Fatalities from mushrooms take</p>

  <p class="calibre1">place where peoples are in transition, moving up in the scale of mycophagy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is abundant evidence that slowly, very slowly, the peoples of Europe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are learning to eat wild mushrooms. Their progress is reflected in their vocabu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lary. Some words that were born with a pejorative curse rise in status and ac-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quire excellence in the course of centuries; such, we believe, are <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">cepe</i> in French, and <i class="calibre4">boletus</i> in Latin. More often a new and appetizing word is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">borrowed from a mycophagic people to designate a mushroom that, seen in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">new light, has come to be esteemed for food. Such is 'mushroom' in English,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and <i class="calibre4">champignon</i> throughout the other Germanic lands, and <i class="calibre4">boletus,</i> which in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">German has become <i class="calibre4">Pilz.</i> Specially interesting is the Swedish name for the cep:</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Karl Johans-svamp,</i> named after the founder of the present royal family, King</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Charles XVI John, a Frenchman, who having risen from the ranks to become</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Napoleon's General Bernadotte, was elected to Sweden's throne in 1818. It was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he who drew the attention of Swedes to the succulent properties of the boletus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">edulis. We discover without surprise that the Bernadottes were a Gascon family,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hailing from that province of France which is renowned for ceps. A good Gascon,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">General Bernadotte was a missionary of mycophagy to the mycophobic Swedes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The mycophobic peoples seem to acquire their knowledge in little leaps, sug-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gestive of the quantum theory, learning to like one species after another. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English generally know only the psalliota campestris, and the Norwegians the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cantharellus cibarius; the Spaniards of Castile eat two kinds, the <i class="calibre4">mizcalo</i> (a lacta-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rius) and the <i class="calibre4">seta de cardo</i> (pleurotus eryngii), by contrast with the vast command</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the subject enjoyed by the Catalans. The poverty of the Spanish language</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when it comes to mushrooms occasionally works a hardship on Spanish writers:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Spanish encyclopaedias the authors of the articles on <i class="calibre4">hongos</i> must resort to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Catalan and Basque words to piece out the poor Castilian vocabulary. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spanish public has never been offered a Spanish mushroom manual, and if</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a Spaniard should seek to explore the mushroom world, he must resort to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Basque work, <i class="calibre4">Setas u Hongos del Pais Vasco,</i> a treatise in two slim volumes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">written in Spanish by Telesforo de Aranzadi and published in 1897. Based</p>

  <p class="calibre1">entirely on observations in the Basque country, it is precious especially for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wealth of Basque vernacular names that it records. The public demand for this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">work must have been modest, for the original edition is still in print and copies</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are available generally in Spanish book shops.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">339</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_122"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_61">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">In Portugal the peasants know chiefly the lepiota procera, which they call</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4">nisco</i> or <i class="calibre4">centeiro.</i> The Basques, with a substantial vocabulary, are well advanced</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in mycophagy, but many of their words are borrowed, and mycophagy among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them is perhaps not indigenous. Strangely, they possess no name for the lactarius</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sanguifluus, which is esteemed by both Catalans and Castilians. On the other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hand, we can testify that in Viscaya the Basques manifest an addiction for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">russula virescens. In the west of that western Basque province, this mushroom,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which is the best of the russulas, is called by a specific name <i class="calibre4">-guibelurdina,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">but in Guernica it appears to so dominate the field of mycophagy that it becomes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">simply the 'mushroom' <i class="calibre4">- perretxiko.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Various strands of evidence support our view that Western Europe is pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gressing in mycophagy. Take Italy, for example. Today immense quantities of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms are eaten there, and the local names are numerous. But we observe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that poisonings often occur - a sure sign of imperfect knowledge. From Pliny</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and other ancient writers we know that certain mushrooms were fashionable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among the fastidious elite in imperial Rome, but if we ask our question about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the rest of the population, we must admit that we know little. Apicius gives</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us various mushroom recipes, and Pliny describes several kinds with suf-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ficient detail for us to guess at their identity, in two or three cases with con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fidence. But Pliny himself looked down his nose at mushrooms, and there is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one sentence in his <i class="calibre4">Natural History</i> that, almost by inadvertence, reveals his own</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophobic leanings. With some impatience he admits that others know more</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about mushrooms than he. "Who, in fact," says he, "is able to distinguish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among them, except those who dwell in the country, and those who are in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the habit of gathering them?" That is, who knew the mushrooms except the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">untutored rustics, mute for us, and the minions of the epicures in the great</p>

  <p class="calibre1">city? As to the epicures, Pliny with disdain tells us that mushrooms were the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">only dish they would prepare with their own hands, thus relishing them twice</p>

  <p class="calibre1">over, once in anticipation and once in the eating. Here are the rich phrases of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pliny's Elizabethan translator, Philemon Holland:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">. . . our fine-mouthed and daintie wantons who set such store by their tooth, take</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so great delight to dresse this onely dish with their owne hands, that they may feed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">therupon in conceit and cogitation all the while they bee handling and preparing the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same, furnished in this their businesse with their fine knives and razors of amber, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other vessels of silver plate about them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On an earlier page we saw <i class="calibre4">that fungus</i> was an epithet in ancient Rome, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">equivalent of 'dunce' or 'gump' in English - an indication that the people who</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so used the word had little esteem for mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">340</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE ANATOMY OF MYCOPHOBIA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jumping now to Renaissance times, we open the earliest printed cookbook,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">entitled <i class="calibre4">De Honesta Voluptate,</i> attributed to a Vatican dignitary named Platina</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and printed in Rome c. 1474. There we find a section on mushrooms, and it is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a farrago of mycophobic nonsense, of a kind that would not be tolerated by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discriminating Italians today. It must have expressed more or less the sentiments</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the upper crust in the Rome of Platina's day. This work was translated into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">many languages and it almost monopolized the cookbook market for a century</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and more. The French version, of which we have consulted an edition published</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Lyons in 1505, has a peculiar linguistic interest: the translator uses various</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words for 'mushroom' and among them is <i class="calibre4">fonge.</i> This may have been the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">translator's bookish invention; at any rate/onge never took hold in France, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">only part of Romanic Europe where <i class="calibre4">fungus</i> has had no verbal progeny in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vernacular.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Two centuries before Platina another Italian, Aldobrandino da Siena, com-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Countess of Provence, Beatrice ofSavoy.lt appears to have been finished</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the year 1256 and it survives in many manuscripts copied in the course of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ensuing centuries. Aldobrandino relied heavily on the writings in Arabic of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">10th century physician living in Egypt, Isaac Judaeus. Here too we find a chapter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on mushrooms. Aldobrandino writes in the purest mycophobic vein, the best</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that he can say of mushrooms being this, that some there are which are not so</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bad. Though written in French, the Aldobrandino work cannot of course be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">taken as an expression of a French attitude. It is of special interest to us for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">illuminated initial with which the chapter on mushrooms begins.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Coming to France itself, we begin by observing that the French Canadians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">know nothing of wild mushrooms and never eat them. Their ancestors came</p>

  <p class="calibre1">largely from Poitou, with a sprinkling of Basques, Bretons, Channel Islanders,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Normans. A conservative people, the <i class="calibre4">habitants</i> would not have given up</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophagy in the New World, where the forests are rich in kinds that are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">common in France. It seems probable that in their ancestral lands mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were not eaten three centuries ago, and certainly this is still true of the Bretons.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mycophagy in France is spreading north from the Midi and Gascony. The re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ports of poisonings, the modern diffusion of new names like <i class="calibre4">cepe,</i> the constant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">revision of municipal regulations governing the sale of mushrooms - these all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bear witness to growing pains as mycophagy gains ground. Though wild</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms are commonly offered in the marketplaces of France in the appro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">priate seasons, it is not unusual to meet French folk who know nothing whatever</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about them, not even the names of some of the common kinds. Van Sterbeeck</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom! An underlying mycophobia would explain the readiness of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French to associate wild mushrooms with toxic properties. The king of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">introduces a lady of the French landed aristocracy who sells a property called</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">mycodium,</i> 'hate of mushrooms', a strange conceit that we think only a myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phobic writer would invoke. But in Marcel Moussy's <i class="calibre4">Arcole ou la Terre Promise</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">there is an idyllic setting in which a young couple go mushroom gathering.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Certain <i class="calibre4">gastronomes</i> among our French friends resent our imputation of my-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cophobia to the French. But take Montaigne. This giant of the Renaissance,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who poured the rich contents of his mind and feelings into his essays, ignores</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fungal world. Not even truffles are so much as mentioned by this son of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perigord. True, Montaigne had apparently little interest in food and drink of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">any kind. But then let us look at his elder contemporary, whom he admired,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Fran9ois Rabelais. When Epistemon visits the abode of the damned, he dis-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">covers there all the personages of antiquity, and finds that for all eternity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they are condemned to menial and insignificant occupations: Alexander the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Great darns breeches while Dido peddles mushrooms! Elsewhere Rabelais pre-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sents to his readers an obnoxious character called Lent-observer whose pinched</p>

  <p class="calibre1">soul knows only denial. He had a <i class="calibre4">potiron,</i> mushroom, for a chin, and his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">excrement consisted of morels and toadstools. There is never a kind word for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms in Rabelais, this native of Chinon in the very heart of France.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is never easy to trace down the centuries the gastronomic role of a kind of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom. Perhaps the distinctive truffle offers us the best opportunity for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">such a chronicle, yet here too we encounter contradictions. According to M. G.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Malen9on in <i class="calibre4">Les Truffes Europeennes,2</i> for a thousand years after the fall of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Roman Empire no one in Italy or France paid attention to truffles. In the I4th</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century they reappeared. During the Renaissance the truffle of Perigord - tuber</p>

  <p class="calibre1">melanosporum - established its ascendancy, and with some ups and downs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thereafter maintained a secure place high in the firmament of gastronomic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">values in the most exalted circles of France. We have already seen that the English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">diarist Evelyn was making the acquaintance of truffles in Vienne in the lyth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century, and after the Restoration in England they begin to appear in cookbooks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">across the Channel. Yet we have also seen that Brillat-Savarin in the early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">iQth century considered the truffle a modern innovation in Paris. These seeming</p>

  <p class="calibre1">contradictions can be reconciled when we remind ourselves that we are dealing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with accidental references by writers belonging to the articulate elite of France</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and England. In our section on the truffle we produced linguistic evidence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">showing that the truffle was always an article of commerce in the humble market-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">places of the Mediterranean peoples, bought and sold and consumed by countless</p>

  <p class="calibre1">generations of unlettered folk.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the beginning the Germanic world was steeped in darkest mycophobia.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Certainly nowhere in European literature is there a more perfect expression of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">loathing for mushrooms - all the more eloquent because taken for granted -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than in the writings of Saxo Grammaticus, the Danish historian who flourished</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about A.D. 1200. He was telling of a military campaign waged in Sweden</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by Hadding the Dane in the loth century, and how the Danes ran out of pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">visions, and were driven to the last extremities of hunger. Here in Book I:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">viii: 7 of his <i class="calibre4">Saxonis Gesta Danorum</i> we discover the low opinion in which the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Danes of olden times held wild mushrooms:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">. . . After the spring thaw, Hadding returned to Sweden and there spent five years</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in warfare. By reason of this lengthy campaign, his soldiers, having consumed all their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">provisions, were reduced virtually to starvation, and resorted to forest mushrooms to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">satisfy their hunger. Finally under pressure of extreme necessity they ate their horses,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in the end they satisfied themselves with the carcasses of dogs. Even worse, they did</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not scruple to eat human limbs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now that the passing centuries have dimmed for us the personal sufferings of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hadding's host, we may permit ourselves to be amused by the graduated stages1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of their desperation as reflected in their diet, and our thoughts turn to what</p>

  <p class="calibre1">soldiers of other origins would have done in a like pass. Had they been Celts,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they would surely have eaten horses, dogs, and each other before turning to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. An amusing parallel to the plight of Hadding's host is to be found in the Spanish classic, <i class="calibre4">El Viage Entrctenido,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">by Agusrin de Rojas, a contemporary of Shakespere. This narrative gives a vivid picture of the miseries and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">adventures that were the lot of strolling players in Spain at that time. The troupe are making their way from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Barcelona towards Madrid:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After having exhausted our money [five <i class="calibre4">reales\,</i> sold everything that we had left, <i class="calibre4">often eaten of the mush-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">rooms that we gathered along the way,</i> slept on the ground, tramping barefoot (not for the mud but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">because we had no footwear), helped muleteers load their beasts, fetched water for the mules, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sustaining ourselves on turnips for four days and more — stealthily one night we came up to an inn-----</p>

  <p class="calibre1">foul fungi of the forest. If they had been Slavs of the North, they would have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been feasting on those noble mushrooms from the outset of their long campaign,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and, fortified by the delectable fare, would have engaged the enemy like lions,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and most certainly turned the tide of war. Until General Bernadotte, when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">King of Sweden, spoke well of ceps, neither Lapps nor Swedes ate mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We know this because Linnaeus tells us so. In the section on the fungi in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Flora Lapponica,</i> he observes that in Sweden only foreigners consider mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fit for eating, nor does he except himself from the general rule. What a pity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the great Linnaeus was a mycophobe!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As for the Lapps, Linnaeus in the same work tells us where their fungal interest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lay, and the passage is unique in ethno-mycological records. Linnaeus devotes a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lengthy section of his work to the fungi of Lappland, and as he comes to the end</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and is describing Boletus 522, which he calls 'suavaeolens', he reports that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">young Lappish swains when stepping out to keep company with the Lappish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">girls would carry this fungus in a little bag over the male member, that its scent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">might please the nymphs. The 'boletus' used in this way, according to Professor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Heim, was undoubtedly the trametes suavaeolens Fr. ex Linn., conspicuous for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its strong odor of anise. Linnaeus was frank in his description:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Adolescentes hunc inventum sollicite servant in <i class="calibre4">marsupio ante pubem pendulo,</i> ut gratiorem</p>

  <p class="calibre1">odorem spirantes nymphis suis placeant. [Italics ours.]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Knut Hagberg brought out his life of Linnaeus in 1939 he deprived</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this delightful passage of its sap by translating <i class="calibre4">ante pubem pendulo</i> as 'on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stomach' <i class="calibre4">(pa magen),</i> and his English translator further diluted Linnaeus by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hanging the fungus 'from the waist'! Such is the prudery that censors the classics!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Lappish custom moved the mycophobic Linnaeus to indulge in a discursive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rhapsody of the kind that lesser scientists frown upon:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">O ridicula Venus, tibi, quse in exteris regionibus uteris caffea &amp; cocholata, conditis &amp;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">saccharatis, virus &amp; bellariis, gemmis &amp; margaritis, auro et argento, serico et cosmetico,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">saltationibus &amp; conventiculis, musica &amp; comoediis, tibi sufficit his solus exsuccus fungus.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">O whimsical Venus! In other climes you ask for coffee and chocolate, pickles and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sweetmeats, wines and goodies, gems and pearls, gold and silver, silks and cosmetics, balls</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and parties, music and the theater. Here your wants are met with a little withered fungus!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We can show that long after Saxo Grammaticus, and even after the Reforma-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion, mycophobia was still rampant in Germany. A few years ago there was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discovered in the Copenhagen Royal Library a document of high cultural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">interest. It was penned early in the lyth century by a Hanseatic merchant of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">344</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE ANATOMY OF MYCOPHOBIA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lubeck who had sojourned long enough in Pskov to learn the Russian dialect</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of that city. The manuscript is a textbook of colloquial Russian, giving as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">exercises in Russian phraseology authentic dialogues recorded by the author.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Among them are a few between Russians and Germans in which each side praises</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the life of his own home town. In the course of one such colloquy we come upon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a German mycophobic boast of priceless value for our argument, proving as it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">does the contrast between Russian and German attitudes toward the fungal world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here are the texts in the Russian dialect of Pskov and the German dialect of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lubeck, along with an English translation by Mrs. Elizabeth van Schooneveld,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who is now editing the manuscript for publication:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nashi nemetzkie ljudi zhivut kak [g]ospodari, svezhe mjaso da svezhi ryby jedjaft] da</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vina da pivo p'ju[t], da vashi ljudi kak psy borzye, ryzh[i]ki griben jedja[t] da p'ju[t]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wyn und beer, und juwe volk alse beste und wynthunde ehten poggenstole und drinken</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wahter und qwasz.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our German people live like lords, eat fresh meat and fresh fish and drink wines and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beer, and your people like beasts and coursing hounds, eat toadstools and drink water</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and kvas.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The aspersion thrown into the teeth of the Russians by the merchant of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lubeck is corroborated by linguistic evidence of singular probative value. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jews of Germany some centuries ago migrated east into the Slavic lands, taking</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with them their language based on medieval German dialects, which we know</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as Yiddish. The mushroom vocabulary in Yiddish is largely Slavic, borrowed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">after the migration. The generic term for 'mushroom', however, is <i class="calibre4">shveml,</i> a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">diminutive form from the German <i class="calibre4">Schwamm;</i> the favorable <i class="calibre4">Pilz</i> has no continua-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion in Yiddish. It is clear that when the Jews migrated to Poland, they took no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tradition of mycophagy with them. Apparently the Germans began eating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms late in the Middle Ages, and needing a word to dignify the new</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dish, they turned to the Latin <i class="calibre4">boletus,</i> which in Valerius Cordus (1551) had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">become <i class="calibre4">Boltz</i> and in Clusius (1601) was <i class="calibre4">Btiltz</i> and is today <i class="calibre4">Pilz.</i> Thus <i class="calibre4">Pilz</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">entered Germany's fungal vocabulary at the top, to suit the dinner-table, while</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at the lower end of the scale the pejorative <i class="calibre4">Krotenschwamm,</i> also recorded by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Clusius as current in his day, fell into disuse and finally disappeared from High</p>

  <p class="calibre1">German. Here we see how a change in names reflected, and at the same time</p>

  <p class="calibre1">encouraged, a change in attitude toward the eating of wild fungi. It is noteworthy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the growth of mycophagy in Germany appears to have been a response</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_64">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">to Mediterranean influences descending culturally from above, rather than an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eruption of the Slavic substratum that was still strong in Central Europe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Today in Sweden and Denmark and Southern Germany and German Swit-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">zerland, bands of young people go out in season from the cities to gather</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms. The market places of Southern Germany and Switzerland are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">well stocked with many kinds of wild mushrooms. Is not this interest a modern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thing, perhaps as modern as the sport of mountain-climbing ? Do the rustics</p>

  <p class="calibre1">know their mushrooms as these city youths do - except as the market demand</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the cities has led the country folk to respond by gathering the appropriate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kinds &gt; Is there not here a cultural penetration that began with the sophisticated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">city circles and spread thence to the countryside ? Dr. J. Schlittler, Pilzkontrol-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">leur of Zurich, confirms our suspicion. He tells us that in the back valleys of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alps the peasants still reject all mushrooms, still view them through medieval</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eyes, clinging to the old mycophobic beliefs. We also learn that the Romansch-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speaking country folk of the Surselva and the Engadine know nothing of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">edible wild mushrooms and care nothing, though in these lovely valleys they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grow in abundance. There is evidence that while Otto Bismarck was serving</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as Ambassador in Russia around 1860 he discovered and mastered the art of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom knowing, and acquired a taste for mushroom hunting and marinated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms that he took back with him to Germany.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though we think mycophagy among the Swiss is a modern growth, its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hold is already secure. A story, told to us in Geneva as true, bears witness to this.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">An aged countryman in the Suisse Romande found himself borne down by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the infirmities of age and the loss of those dearest to him. There came a time when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he invited a young friend to pass a long and arduous day with him in the moun-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tains. A glorious day it was, in the course of which the old man took pains to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reveal to his companion with painstaking precision all of the spots known to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">him where mushrooms grew, various kinds of mushrooms but especially morels,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">knowledge slowly gathered on solitary rambles made for that purpose over the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">course of a long life. Marveling to himself at this untoward behavior, the young</p>

  <p class="calibre1">man showed proper appreciation and made careful note of all the locations.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That night the unhappy octogenarian took his own life. His penultimate act</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had been to pass on to the youth of his choice his precious possession, a worldly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">legacy that no testamentary provision could have conveyed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indifference that overlies a sleeping hostility is the attitude toward wild mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. See letter written by Konstantin Leont'ev dated Dec. 3, 1887, published in <i class="calibre4">Bogoslovskij Vestnik,</i> 1914, No. 4,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pp. 776-7. Professor Cizevsky, who discovered this reference, raises the further question whether the sour</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cream often served with 'Bismarck herring" was not borrowed from the Russian cuisine, perhaps from a favorite</p>

  <p class="calibre1">way of serving mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE ANATOMY OF MYCOPHOBIA</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms of the typical mycophobe in a country like England. He and his neigh-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bors think alike about these creatures; rather, they react alike, for they do not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">think, ignoring as they do their own infirmity. The mycophobe does not ini-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tiate a discussion about wild mushrooms. If the subject comes up in his pre-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sence, instantly he is on his guard. He is almost sure to recall some fatal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">episode involving poisonous mushrooms that, he says, came within his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">personal experience. He admits grudgingly that some good wild mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms exist, but his strongly held view is that all are dangerous save a few, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these no amateur can be relied upon to identify. Yes, identification is difficult</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and never sure. As like as not, the mycophobe will tell you that every good kind</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has its deadly counterpart, as though Divine Providence had deliberately laid</p>

  <p class="calibre1">booby traps to catch the fool who insists upon hunting mushrooms. He is apt to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">go on and suggest that kinds familiar to you in your country may well be deadly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hereabouts. He volunteers his advice for your own good, as one who wishes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to be clearly on record that your death will be on your own head. He is dogmatic,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his voice has a cutting edge. If you are bold and put questions to him, you</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover at once that he knows nothing about wild mushrooms, and that he is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">happy and even determined to remain in invincible ignorance, feeling that that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">way safety lies. Furthermore, this mycophobia of the North Sea basin is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dominant trait. The English-speaking mycophobe when he goes to live in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophagous country seldom learns to know the mushrooms and avoids eating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them. By contrast, the mycophagous Slavs who live in England or the United</p>

  <p class="calibre1">States sometimes succumb, albeit slowly, to the steady pressure of the hostile</p>

  <p class="calibre1">environment, weakly accepting the facile advice of well-meaning but ignorant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">neighbors who assure them that the species they knew and loved in the lands of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their childhood become deadly, for some mysterious reason, inside the political</p>

  <p class="calibre1">frontiers of an English-speaking world. How truly John Parkinson spoke for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his countrymen when in 1640, in his <i class="calibre4">Theatrum Botanicutn,</i> he begins his chapter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the 'Dangerous Mushrooms' with the observation that he can be brief about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them, for it would be to little purpose (as he says) to dwell on them, inasmuch</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the English need no caution "to beware of the bad, seeing our Nation is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not so enclined to the good".</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Englishman's rejection of the mushroom tribe is a Pavlov reflex. We have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known Englishmen who retch at the thought of eating a wild mushroom, just</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as some orthodox Jews do at the thought of pork. Wilmarth Lewis, presiding</p>

  <p class="calibre1">over the world of Horace Walpole, has drawn to our attention a delightful</p>

  <p class="calibre1">passage in a letter that Walpole wrote on October 17, 1758, to Lady Hervey.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the flimsiest provocation, the Duke of Newcastle had lately given an exhi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">347</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_130"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_65">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">bition of violent mycophobia that must be considered classic. For the sake of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quotation from Jeremiah, Walpole changes Newcastle's famous chef Chloe into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a woman. Here is the episode in Walpole's words:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This will be a melancholy letter, for I have nothing to tell your Ladyship but tragical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stories. Poor Dr Shawe being sent for in great haste to Claremont (it seems the Duchess had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">caught a violent cold by a hair of her own whisker getting up her nose and making her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sneeze) — the poor Doctor, I say, having eaten a few mushrooms before he set out, was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">taken so ill, that he was forced to stop at Kingston; and being carried to the first apoth-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ecary's prescribed a medicine for himself which immediately cured him. This catastrophe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so alarmed the Duke of Newcastle that he immediately ordered all the mushroom beds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to be destroyed, and even the toadstools in the park did not escape scalping in this general</p>

  <p class="calibre1">massacre. What I tell you is literally true. Mr. Stanley, who dined there last Sunday, and is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not partial against that court, heard the edict repeated, and confirmed it to me last night.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And a voice of lamentation was heard at Ramah in Claremont, <i class="calibre4">Chloe</i> weeping for <i class="calibre4">her</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, and they are not!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is a striking contrast between mycophobic and mycophilic peoples</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when it comes to fungal vocabularies. In Muscovy and Provence and Catalonia</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the countryfolk possess a huge vocabulary, familiar to all, and ancient. If in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">those countries there be any who do not know their mushrooms, these benighted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">individuals are pitiful city-bred waifs, cut off from the land that gave them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">birth and from their proper cultural heritage. In mycophobic countries, the far-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mers know almost nothing about wild mushrooms and speak of them with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">two or three undiscriminating words. But in the cities there will be found little</p>

  <p class="calibre1">circles of amateurs who make a hobby or cult of their mushroomic knowledge,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and who learn from manuals a large vocabulary that circulates only on their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lips. The run of rustic English folk know 'toadstool', 'mushroom', 'puffbalT, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">possibly a few localisms. If the countryman knows 'fungus', it is as a learned</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word. Only in cities and in esoteric circles, does one hear of truffles and morels</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and ceps, not to speak of death-cups, destroying angels, shaggy-manes, and all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the other book-words that the manuals carry. The reader of these manuals is at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a loss about these so-called vulgar names. Some are clearly of venerable lineage.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For example, no mycologist would have invented the 'horse mushroom' for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">psalliota arvensis; the term belongs with 'horse-radish', 'horse chestnut', and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'horse mussel', wherein the first element means 'large' or 'coarse'. We think</p>

  <p class="calibre1">also that 'shaggy mane' for the coprinus comatus may be a word of respectable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lineage: as long ago as 1802 A. F. M. Willich in <i class="calibre4">The Domestic Encyclopedia</i> was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">writing about the 'shaggy spunk', a mushroom known to science in his day as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the boletus hirsutus. On the other hand, where a common name is wanting, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycologists seem to have invented fanciful neologisms to meet the need, without</p>

  <p class="calibre1">troubling to distinguish genuine localisms from the fruit of their own fancies.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Today there are excellent mushroom manuals in France and England, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">until our generation the manuals in those countries were often saturated with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophobic caution. I possess the Russian manual, published in 1903, that origin-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ally belonged to Tatiana, daughter of Nicholas II, in which in childish hand-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">writing she wrote her name. It is a delightful book, full of friendliness for wild</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, all of which seem to be considered good except two or three kinds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that are cursorily dismissed. By contrast, some of the older manuals of France</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and England deliberately set out to frighten the reader. They are filled with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">labored warnings, giving the impression that all mushrooms are bad except a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">few kinds that even the careful reader can hardly hope to learn, even if he uses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">utmost care. By a curious twist of fate, this excess of caution in the manuals</p>

  <p class="calibre1">once accidentally contributed to the undoing of a murderer, as we have seen</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in our account of 1'affaire Girard.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wild fungi are an emotional trip-hammer for mycophile and mycophobe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alike, and in the poets with their heightened sensibilities the contrast in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">response to fungi is sharpest. Professor Roman Jakobson was spending the sum-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mer of 1919 in Pushkino, near Moscow, with the poet Vladimir Majakovskij,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who would go out almost daily into the forest to look for mushrooms. He would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">usually return with a large basket full of them. He knew them all and where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to look for every kind. He told his companion that mushroom gathering offered</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the ideal accompaniment for the composition of poetry, and in the course of that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">summer he composed the best parts of his epic, <i class="calibre4">150 Million,</i> while engaged in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this pastime. During the previous season, in 1918, he had conceived his play</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Mystery Bouffe</i> in the woods among the mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now contrast Majakovskij's feelings with those of D. H. Lawrence. Not long</p>

  <p class="calibre1">after the scene in Pushkino, the Englishman wrote his poem entitled <i class="calibre4">How</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Beastly the Bourgeois Is,</i> and to match the repugnance that he felt for his subject,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he resorts to mushrooms for his analogy:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How beastly the bourgeois is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">especially the male of the species -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nicely groomed, like a mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">standing there so sleek and erect and eyeable -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and like a fungus, living on the remains of bygone life,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sucking his life out of the dead leaves of greater life than his own.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And even so, he's stale, he's been there too long, Touch</p>

  <p class="calibre1">him, and you'll find he's all gone inside just like an old</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom, all wormy inside, and hollow under a smooth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">skin and an upright appearance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Full of seething, wormy, hollow feelings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rather nasty -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How beastly the bourgeois is!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Standing in their thousands, these appearances, in damp England</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what a pity they can't all be kicked over</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like sickening toadstools, and left to melt back, swiftly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into the soil of England.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here then in these two literary artists we discover the perfect mycophile and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the perfect mycophobe. For the Russian a world carpeted with mushrooms is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elysium. For the Englishman that same world conjures up foul exhalations rising</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wraith-like from rotting swamps, and the mephitic horror turns his stomach.</p>
