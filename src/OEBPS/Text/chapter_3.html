      When mushrooms abound, there'll be war around.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      An old Russian belief.

    </div>

    <div>
      and Anglo-Saxon attitudes a random thing. But these mushrooms hint at the
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      a answer to bigger questions, far beyond food and cookery. A people who
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      have always had an abundance of other foods are little tempted to brave the

    <div>
      initial perils of the mushroom world. However, in the desperate exigencies of
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      all-out war, of chronic war through decades and generations and centuries, of
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      defensive warfare with homes ravaged and farms left untended, where the

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      unslaughtered remnants of the population hide from the pitiless invader in
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      woods and swamps and fields - under these conditions, I suggest, men and
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      women will discover the humble mushroom, and will prove the various
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      kinds by trial and error, and make friends among them in time of need. For
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />

    <div>
      mushrooms, springing up almost overnight, will be God's manna to a people
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      driven from their homes into the wilderness. And the knowledge thus gained,
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      joined with emotions of gratitude born of the circumstances, will not be

    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      and the cultivated crops, will be assigned in men's minds their appointed

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      old belief in Russia that when mushrooms abound, war is in the offing. The

    <div>
      thoughtless intellectuals of the world despise such homely sayings, which on

    <div>
      the surface are nonsense. But ofttimes those sayings are the cryptic expression of
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      experience graven deep in the recesses of a people's past. Mushrooms are not
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      harbingers of war: it is the other way round. When the dogs of war are

  <p class="calibre1">know that mushrooms may soon be their mainstay.1 Our theory finds disturb-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing support in a book published in Prague just as the Communist curtain was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about to descend on that city. The book dealt with Czech folk food. A peasant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speaking of a mushroom called <i class="calibre4">horyl</i> (from <i class="calibre4">hofeti,</i> 'to burn'), said that it burnt</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mouth even when thrice boiled, yet in the 'great hungers' it was always</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eaten, and when hunger and the pest would return, again it would be eaten.2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This link between war and mushrooms can be detected, albeit faintly, in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Anglo-Saxon world. It is said that during the final phases of the American</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Civil War the people in the devastated stretches of the South turned to mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms for sustenance. Certain it is that a famous botanist living at that time</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Carolinas, the Rev. M. A. Curtis, wrote how "during the late war I</p>

  <p class="calibre1">paid no attention to Botany, except to the edible mushrooms, from which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I have gotten many a substantial and luxurious meal."3 He gladly shared his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">esoteric lore with the neighbors, who, food being scarce, were apt pupils,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and such was his success that he embarked on a book to spread the useful tid-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ings. It was to be called <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">Mycophagia</b> Americana,</i> but by the time it was ready,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the war was over and publishers were not interested.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In England during the recent war there were public and private efforts to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">increase the consumption of wild fungi. We know one elderly Russian lady</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who for a time made good money gathering <i class="calibre4">belyegriby</i> onWimbledon Common,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in full sight of the wondering English. She pickled or precooked them and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sold them to a fashionable restaurant. But, although England's peril was acute,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there was, as things turned out, little actual hunger; and furthermore, when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">measured against the long history of a people, the crisis was brief. The times</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were not bad enough for mushrooms to take hold. Today there are those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who fear that England's bitterest trials lie ahead, in her peace-time efforts to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">feed herself. If chronic want, real want, should for the first time in history</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beset the English people, there will be the mushrooms to turn to, and a precious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reserve they will prove to be.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">More than a century ago a famous French chef, Louis Eustache Ude, pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pounded an ingenious and amusing theory to explain the lackadaisical attitude</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the English toward food and cookery - an ingenious theory it was, but,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as I shall show, completely unsound. He began by denouncing physicians as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'enemies of the art' of cooking, and then he went on:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. But the Russian saying seems to be widely current in Europe. Consult the entry 'Pilze' in <i class="calibre4">Handworterbuch des</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Deutschen Aberglaubens,</i> by E. Hoffmann-Krayer, 1935-6, where we find the German dialectical <i class="calibre4">Viel Schwamma</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">- vieljamma,</i> the Italian <i class="calibre4">anno fungato - anno tribolato,</i> and the French <i class="calibre4">an de cepere - an de misere,</i> reported in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Basses Pyrenees.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">38</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUSHRO OMS AND HISTORY</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I am greatly concerned at being obliged to combat a still more powerful, though</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amiable, enemy to Cookery. The Ladies of England are unfavorably disposed toward our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">art; yet I find no difficulty in assigning the cause of it. It is particularly the case with them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(and indeed it is so in some measure with our own sex) that they are not introduced to their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">parents' table till their palates have been completely benumbed by the strict diet observed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the nursery and the Boarding Schools.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The baneful influence of the nursery and the boarding school is doubtless all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the author said, but one would have liked to remind the great Maitre that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the rudiments of any distinguished cuisine grow out of the people, the whole</p>

  <p class="calibre1">people, and nothing but the people; that the leisure class merely spin refine-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ments for the most democratic of the arts; and that the people by and large</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have never known either nursery or boarding school. If the English in general</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seem to the rest of us indifferent to good food, and some of them even disap-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">proving of the fine art of pleasing the palate - if the English bill of fare lacks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">variety and the good ingredients are spoiled in preparation - these short-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">comings of a noble people must go back to deeper, broader causes than the child-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">life of the well-to-do. For a thousand years England never knew war - war</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as others and especially the Russians suffered it - and England has never known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">prolonged, desperate want. Hardship is the school in which people forget food</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tabus, and acquire that deep reverence for food and its preparation that inspires</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a great cuisine. Everyone who knows anything about Russia will recall that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">simple and moving ceremony of hospitality in which bread and salt, symbols</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of food, are offered on a tray to the honored guest. That ceremony is an ancient,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">almost sacramental expression of reverence for food, and Russia's history gives</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning to that reverence. In the Anglo-Saxon world only prolonged want will,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">some day perhaps, bring about a comparable respect for food. If England, that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">land unique in moral resources and spiritual unity, be destined to endure privation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">over the coming generations, the hardships will most certainly give birth to new</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and lustrous chapters in her history, chapters of stirring and triumphant drama -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and incidentally, I predict, they will bring about at last a worthy English cuisine.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps the reader by now is protesting that I have overlooked England's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">famous warrior past. Oh, yes, I know that her history is studded with decisive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">battles. Crecy and Blenheim and Trafalgar and Waterloo, glorious victories</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and sometimes glorious defeats. But they were all fought abroad, by a handful</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of men at sea or in other people's homes. They were fought way down yonder</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among the heathen, somewhere off Flores in the A9ores. Those wars were like</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. <i class="calibre4">The French Cook,</i> by Louis Eustache Ude, one-time cook to Louis XVI and the Earl of Sefton. This work</p>

  <p class="calibre1">went through many editions in both England and the United States. The early editions carried an essay entitled,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">' On Cookery and its imputed ill effects on health', whence I take my quotation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">39</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_47"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_19">CHAPTER THREE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">big-game hunting, stepped up another dimension. Of course there were civil</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wars also, back in the lyth century, and the I5th, and under King Stephen,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and there were border frays along the way. But civil wars, however cruelly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fought, lack the ultimate sting, for, whoever wins, members of the family</p>

  <p class="calibre1">retain possession of the homestead. No intruder takes over the patrimony.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">These comments about wars go for the United States too; broadly speaking,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the tally until our own generation adds up to two civil wars (including the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">War of Independence) and a few brief expeditionary ventures.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yes, whoever seeks seriously to understand Russia must make the needed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">effort of intellect and imagination to comprehend the full and awful meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of war in the history of the Slavs. This is the first and great imperative. (In the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">winter of 1939-40, when the Finnish army seemed for a time to hold its own</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with heroic courage against the Russian forces, how often did my American</p>

  <p class="calibre1">friends remark to me that, after all, the Finnish successes were not surprising,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">since Russia had had no warrior past!) As compared with the West, and especially</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the English-speaking world, war for the Russians has been a calamity of a wholly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">different and greater order of magnitude. Pause for a moment and consider</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this. In the wide range of the English vocabulary are there words of more awful</p>

  <p class="calibre1">potency than 'Huns' and 'Tartars'? It was in the fourth century that the Huns burst</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like a rocket out of Asia into Europe, and the Mongol hordes followed them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seven centuries later. This was all long ago and far away. The Huns in the end</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were stopped on the fields of France, and the Tartars never got into the West.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yet the mere names of these far-off peoples of ages past still trail clouds of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terror in the minds of nations then unborn, in continents then unknown. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">earliest description of the Tartars by an unidentified Englishman who sojourned</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among them will explain in some measure the fearful impact of that strange</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and pitiless people on the European mind:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They be hardie and strong in the breast, leane and palefaced, rough and hufshouldred,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">having flatte and short noses, long and sharpe chinnes, their upper jawes are low and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">declining, their teeth long and thinne, their eye-browes extending from their foreheads</p>

  <p class="calibre1">down to their noses, their eies inconstant and blacke, their countenances writhen and ter-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rible, their extreame joynts strong with bones and sinewes, having thicke and great thighes,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and short legs, and yet being equall unto us in stature: for that length which is wanting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in their legs is supplied in the upper parts of their bodies.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Slavs, let us remember, met the Huns face to face, and the Russians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bowed to the yoke of the Tartars for three full centuries. Nowadays we hear</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUSHROOMS AND HISTORY</p>

  <p class="calibre1">glib talk of 'genocide', a new word meaning the murder of a people; but the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Slavs dwelt for centuries on the highways of the Great Migrations, and, had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their powers of survival been less, they would have been absorbed or extermi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nated many times over. Other nations and tribes did disappear in the ethnic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">maelstrom of the Steppes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Huns' and 'Tartars' are not the only linguistic contribution to the West</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Asiatic invaders. No one knows for sure the origin of the word 'ogre';</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it probably comes to us from the people called Ugri, known to us as the Hun-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">garians, who drove or were pushed into the Danubian plain in the pth century.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our word 'horde' comes from the language of the Tartars. For them (as for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Russians to this day) <i class="calibre4">ordd</i> is simply the headquarters of a marching host,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the Golden Horde was the supreme headquarters on the Volga of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tartars who subjugated the Slavs of the steppes and of Moscow. In a lexicon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that comes down to us from the library of the poet Petrarch (the <i class="calibre4">Codex Cumani-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">cus)</i> we learn the curious fact that the Asiatic invaders referred to the Holy See</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Rome as the Horde <i class="calibre4">(ordd)</i> of Christendom. The West in taking over the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word changed its meaning to cover the swarms of ferocious invaders. In India</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same word, now <i class="calibre4">Urdu,</i> came to mean the language of the nomad camps.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Steppes - those moist, fertile plains that fan out to the north of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Black Sea - are the monumental stage on which from the beginnings of history</p>

  <p class="calibre1">East and West have clashed, in an historical drama of epic grandeur. Like the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whirling waters of a rising tide that contend from divers directions for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mastery of a level beach, through thousands of years a succession of mi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grating tribes from East and South and West have flowed into the Steppes, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">overrun them, and battled with each other for possession; and then with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">passing of time have vanished into the earth. In recent centuries the Turks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">made their vain bid for title; before them, the Tartars, speaking a kindred</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dialect. Before the Tartars came the Polovtsi, and before them the Pechenegs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">These last-named warrior peoples are scarcely known to Westerners, but they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">left dreadful, indelible scars on Russian memories. Before them came out of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Asia the hard-riding Avars, and before the Avars the Huns. The Avars and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Huns made general use of bridles, stirrups, and saddles. With their horses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these mounted warriors revolutionized warfare, and rendered the famed Roman</p>

  <p class="calibre1">legion obsolete. Before the Huns, from the Baltic, there swept down into the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Steppes and Crimea the Visigoths, the Ostrogoths, and the Goths. Those Goths</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were securely settled in the Crimea by 250 A.D., and there they lingered on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for a thousand years. In the middle of the idth century a famous traveler,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">de Busbecq, encountered in the Turkish dominions a few individuals who still</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_49"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_20">CHAPTER THREE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">could recall some words of their ancestral Teutonic tongue. And down even</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to our own days, in the Caucasus, there is a fair-haired people whose neighbors</p>

  <p class="calibre1">call them, erroneously, the Goths. Before the Goths, the Sarmatians, of Persian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">origin, ruled the Steppes for centuries, and before them the Scythians, who</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were dwelling in the land when the Greek historian Herodotus went sightsee-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing up the Dniepr River. And before the Scythians legend tells us of the shadowy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cimmerians.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In thus spanning the millenniums we have omitted many famous peoples:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Scandinavians, who swept down from the North through the waterways</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Russia to the very gates of Byzantium; the Greek and later the Italian colo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nial empires in the Black Sea; the Ugri or Magyars who crossed the Steppes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to settle in what we call Hungary; the Bulgars who once dwelt in the Volga</p>

  <p class="calibre1">valley and now till their cherished Balkan soil; the strange and mighty Khazar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Empire on the northern slopes of the Caucasus, whose sovereign had to be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jewish by religion; the Alani, and the Assi who gave their name to the Sea of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Azov; and many another tribe of uncouth name - the Utiguri, the Kutriguri,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Onoguri - who lived out their day and vanished.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Compared with those Homeric dramas of the past, how fleeting and insigni-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ficant was Hitler's stab across the Steppes to Stalingrad. In the presence of those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Great Migrations, the history of Western Europe, at least up to the Age of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Exploration, seems to be acted out in miniature, and to give off a slightly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">foetid odor as of a hot-house. Viewed in the light of all human history, how</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unusual must be the introspective, intensively developed culture of the com-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">munities clustered along the Western fringes of the Eurasian Continent. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world is destined to devote ever more attention to the peoples of Eastern Europe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the Black Sea Basin, and if the West will unflex its intellectual muscles,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and exercise its capacity for wonder, and lengthen the focus of its mental vision,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what a panorama filled with color and drama will unroll itself!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the folds of the Caucasus mountains there dwell to this day a score of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">isolated peoples, with strange languages many of them as curious as the Basque</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Pyrenees. Like the Ark on neighboring Mount Ararat, these peoples</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have survived the floods of Indo-European and Turkish migrations. They</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are the ethnographic moraines of the world that was old before the Old World</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was born. Sarmatians, Scythians, and Cimmerians - those ancient peoples are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perhaps mere infants alongside these secluded tribes, whose secrets, if we but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">succeed in deciphering them, will make the millenniums seem like centuries.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Little by little our scholars, in our own times, are piecing together the bits</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of evidence, and with their aid revising the perspectives in which we view</p>

  <p class="calibre1">42</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUSHROOMS AND HISTORY</p>

  <p class="calibre1">both ancient Greece and Rome (and that means us their progeny also), against</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the background of earlier, Eastern cultures of unfathomed antiquity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Black Sea is a deep basin. Its deeper waters are so infused with chemicals</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that they sustain no life, and are a graveyard for the detritus of human cultures</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that have passed away. Its stormy surface waters forever rotate in a counter-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clockwise flow, suggestive of the human tides that have wheeled around its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shores as around a hub from time immemorial. Behind Greece and Rome loom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">more and more, as our study of the past progresses, the cultures of the Black</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sea basin; and the Black Sea becomes the enigmatic eye of history.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The peoples of the Great Migrations erupted into the Steppes explosively,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and then in course of time faded away. The Slavs followed different tactics.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Their entrance on the stage of history was inconspicuous - an odd thing for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Dramatist to have devised, when you consider the role they were destined</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to play. Emerging from the neighborhood of the Vistula, they stole impercept-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ibly into the consciousness of men. Perhaps they figure among the numerous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tribes that Herodotus mentions, but he did not make the identification sure.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tacitus in 98 A.D. described the Slavs in his book on Germany, and that was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their formal debut in history. A few centuries later, they had spilled out into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Balkans, and by the pth century the Russians emerge securely established</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Kiev. They were a prolific tribe of farmers, spreading like wire-grass along</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the water-courses. Geographically they were of course European, as European</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the Anglo-Saxons. They were European settlers reaching out to the Eastern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">frontier, and bearing the brunt of Asiatic attacks. (How ironic it must sound</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Asiatic ears when uninformed Westerners decry the Slavs as 'Asiatics'!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the course of ten centuries these European Slavs have pushed the Asiatics</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out of Europe, and then overrun their own vast Continent to the very shores</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Pacific.) Unlike the looting nomadic warriors from the East, they were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a sedentary folk. They belonged to the land and the land belonged to them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is evidence that in their pagan religion they deified the processes of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nature, and above all their Moist Mother Earth. Their attachment to the fertile</p>

  <p class="calibre1">earth is a thing that Westerners, and especially the English-speaking world,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">can hardly grasp. The old religion perhaps still runs through their blood. It</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is the Russian in me that makes me love to plunge my bare hands in the moist</p>

  <p class="calibre1">warm fertile earth, mother earth, the earth that yields us our daily bread, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">food that we reverence as a divine gift, that we worship in the Host. Perhaps</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we love our mushrooms the way we do because they seem the earthiest of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nature's growths. From those pagan times a thousand years ago down to now,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Russians feel themselves attached to the earth viscerally, as by an umbilical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">43</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_21">CHAPTER THREE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">cord. In the early Slavonic chronicles the Russians are depicted always as farmers,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not traders or warriors, and their enemies habitually took advantage of this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dependence on the soil to attack their homesteads and villages at harvest time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Slavs were already then old hands at taking refuge in the woods, just as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the recent war, and those were the circumstances under which, ages earlier,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they must have first come into intimate communion with their friends the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms. As the successive waves of nomads spent their initial force, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Slavs resumed their steady pressure and retook the beloved land and pushed on.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They were the resistant, tenacious, pushing tortoise, and the invaders were the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">showy, easy-come-easy-go hares. The Slavs made some progress in the West</p>

  <p class="calibre1">also, and as late as a few centuries ago, the peasants in Holstein and on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Baltic island of Bornholm were still speaking a Slavic tongue. To this day the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Slav-speaking Wends survive in villages south of Berlin. Many of the place-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">names of Germany are Slavic; Stettin means bristles, and it was the port through</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which this commodity was exported; and Pomerania is merely Pomorjane -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'inhabitants of the sea-shore'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Russians today are a singularly uniform people, as compared with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">extreme mixtures in Western Europe. The traits of the Russians are the traits</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of an Indo-European peasant people indigenous to Europe, first Christianized</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and civilized under Byzantine influences, and politically shaped by the stern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">necessity of waging incessant warfare on all sides for the sheer privilege of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">survival. It fell to them to occupy and defend a desirable land devoid of natural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">defenses, a rich, land-locked inheritance surrounded by covetous and arrogant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">enemies. One reason ofttimes given for the relative uniformity of the Russian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">people has been the absence of mountain barriers in their homeland: the geo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">graphical circumstances have encouraged a cultural and ethnic fluidity. But</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this explanation proves too much: for precisely the same reason they could</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have lost their identity in the vast steppes, exposed forever as they were to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alien peoples on every side, tugging them in every dkection. They survived</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as a homogeneous ethnic group and a cultural entity because, for reasons deeply</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hidden in the racial strain, they chose to resist foreign encroachments. This</p>

  <p class="calibre1">struggle has been the theme of Russia's history - the continual temptation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to assimilate foreign influences, leading to violent rejection in the interests</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of self-preservation, and ending in every instance with a deepened sense of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their folk identity, but an identity molded by the ordeal of the never-ending</p>

  <p class="calibre1">struggle, molded positively by acceptance in some measure of foreign influences,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and negatively by the self-inflicted effects of violent resistance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In one of the earliest accounts of Muscovy written by an Englishman, in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">44</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUSHROOMS AND HISTORY</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Queen Elizabeth's time, there is an observation concerning the Tsar's wars</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that could have been repeated with other names at almost any other period:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His enemies with whom he hath warres for the most part are these: - Litto, Poland,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sweden, Denmarke, Lifland, the Crimmes, Nagaians, and the whole nation of the Tar-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tarians, which are a stoute and a hardie people as any under the Sunne.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A Continental traveler, Sigismund von Herberstein, writing in Latin a half</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century earlier, had remarked of the Russians and their horses that "rest is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seldom given them, for either they are waging war against the Lithuanians,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or the Livonians, or the Swedes, or the Tartars of Cazan; or, if no war is going</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on, the prince generally appoints 20,000 men every year in places about the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don and the Occa, as guards to repress the eruptions and depredations of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tartars of Precop."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We saw in the recent war the tough soldier that the Russian makes. His</p>

  <p class="calibre1">qualities were not born overnight, nor were they the fruit of a single gen-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eration. He was the heir to an old fighting tradition. Read, if you will, this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">account of the same soldier four centuries ago:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They are a kinde of people most sparing in diet, and most patient in extremitie of cold,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">above all others. For when the ground is covered with snowe, and is growen terrible</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and hard with the frost, this Russe hangs up his mantle, or souldiers coate, against that part</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from whence the winde and Snowe drives, and so making a little fire, lieth downe with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his backe towards the weather: this mantle of his serves him for his bed, wall, house and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all: his drinke is colde water of the river, mingled with oatemeale, and this is all his good</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cheere, and he thinketh himselfe well, and daintily fedde therewith, and so sitteth down</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by his fire, and upon the hard ground, rosteth as it were his wearie sides thus daintily</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stuffed: the hard ground is his feather bed, &amp; some blocke or stone his pillow: and as for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his horse, he is as it were a chamberfellow with his master, faring both alike. How justly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">may this barbarous, and rude Russe condemne the daintinesse and nicenesse of our Cap-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">taines, who living in a soile &amp; aire much more temperate, yet commonly use furred</p>

  <p class="calibre1">boots and clokes &gt;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is safe to assume, I think, that this hardy Russ knew his mushrooms.</p>
