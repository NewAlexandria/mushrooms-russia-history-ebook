  <p class="calibre1">1 he French word&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">potiron</i>&nbsp;means 'pumpkin'. In the West of France and as far</p>

  <p class="calibre1">south as the Garonne it also means any large mushroom. The word presents</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what is perhaps the prettiest problem in the whole fungal vocabulary of Eu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rope. No one has hitherto determined its origin. Littre originally quoted Gilles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Menage's suggestion of a word found in the writings of the Arabic thinker</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Avicenna -&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">alphotie.</i>&nbsp;Later in his&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Supplement</i>&nbsp;he added Marcel Devic's alternative</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arabic source, the word&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">futr</i>&nbsp;meaning 'mushroom'. Oscar Bloch in his turn</p>

  <p class="calibre1">favored the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Syrinc pdturtd,</i>&nbsp;which he said meant 'morel'. These bizarre suggestions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with their curious bias for the Near East offer no explanation for&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">potiron</i>&nbsp;in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sense of 'pumpkin'. They only illustrate how even philologists, when at a loss,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">give recognition to the flimsiest guesses. The Arabic and the Syriac words are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">etymologically identical, based on a Semitic root meaning 'to split' or 'to cleave'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Latin&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">cucutna</i>&nbsp;means a kettle,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">cucumis</i>&nbsp;a cucumber, and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">cucurbita</b></i>&nbsp;a gourd.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Among primitive communities living in the climatic zone where gourds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nourish, these have always served for cooking fluid food and boiling water.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This primitive practice must still have been alive in the minds of the ancient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Romans when they used words for kettles and gourds that closely resembled</p>

  <p class="calibre1">each other, and we think that&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">potiron</i>&nbsp;is a translation&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">(pot</i>&nbsp;meaning 'kettle')</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Latin words, preserving for us the semantic link that was obvious in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Latin. But this does not explain the use of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">potiron</i>&nbsp;for 'mushroom'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The pumpkin-mushroom link is not confined to&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">potiron.</i>&nbsp;We discover it in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Provenfal, where&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">coucourlo</i>&nbsp;means both the common field mushroom and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the pumpkin. The Italian&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">cocomero</i>&nbsp;means 'pumpkin' but not mushroom;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Provencal&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">cougoumello</i>&nbsp;is the name of certain mushrooms, but does not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mean pumpkin. The general word for all mushrooms in Portuguese is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">cogumelo;</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">it is not, however, linked with any gourd. We seem to be in the presence here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a variety of words derived from one or the other of the Latin&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">cucuma, cucumis,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">cucurbita.</i>&nbsp;But why are mushrooms found in this company?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">All words such as these, which live out their lives for the most part in oral</p>

  <p class="calibre1">usage, lend themselves to popular contamination with other words. Some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms when they first break the soil look like eggs, and this is why the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amanita caesarea is called in standard Italian the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">ovolo</i>&nbsp;and the amanita muscaria</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">ovolaccio.</i>&nbsp;The French word&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">coque</i>&nbsp;means 'eggshell' and there are colloquial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words in Italian,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">cocco</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">cucco,</i>&nbsp;meaning 'egg'. In standard Italian&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">cocco</i>&nbsp;is some-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times used as another name for the amanita csesarea, and this word takes various</p>

  <p class="calibre1">local forms in the North: in Piedmont <i class="calibre4">cocon</i> or <i class="calibre4">coc</i> or <i class="calibre4">cucon;</i> in Lombardy,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">jung cocch;</i> in Venice, the <i class="calibre4">boleo coco</i> or <i class="calibre4">coco bon;</i> in Genoa, the <i class="calibre4">cucun.</i> (Our English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'cocoon' belongs to the same family.) The names of the amanita muscaria in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">northern Italy bear the same stamp: <i class="calibre4">cocch fals</i> or <i class="calibre4">cocch velenos,</i> or <i class="calibre4">cocch bastard</i> in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Milan. The lepiota procera is the <i class="calibre4">coccomelle</i> or <i class="calibre4">cuccamele</i> in Piedmont; in France</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this species is called in some regions the <i class="calibre4">coulemelle</i> and in others the <i class="calibre4">potiron.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">It would appear that all of these names stem ultimately from the Latin word for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kettle, but have been influenced in their shape by words for eggs or egg-shells.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But all this still leaves unexplained why, in the first place, pumpkins and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms got mixed up together.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Another word for 'pumpkin' in French is <i class="calibre4">pepon,</i> for which Frederic Godefroy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gives the following early variants: <i class="calibre4">popon, poupon, pompon, ponpon.</i> 'Pumpkin'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in English is a popular form of the Middle English 'pumpion', which in turn</p>

  <p class="calibre1">comes from the French word that we are now discussing. For the sake of our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">argument and in advance of our supporting evidence, let us assume that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French <i class="calibre4">word pepon</i> originally carried two meanings, 'pumpkin' and 'mushroom'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It has retained only one in French, and bequeathed only that one to English.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But in Basque <i class="calibre4">papun</i> and <i class="calibre4">panpun</i> mean 'mushroom', and could represent the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lost meaning <i class="calibre4">of pepon.</i> The French philologists have been baffled by the word</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pompon,</i> which is the English 'pompom', since its semantic tie with gourds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is not clear. But the difficulty is solved if the old French word also meant 'mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room', for what is a <i class="calibre4">pompon</i> but a 'mushroom'?1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This hypothesis, supported so far by only two strands of circumstantial evi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dence, still does not tell us why gourds were linked with mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This link is deep-seated, but we believe we can put our finger on it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At the outset let us examine the word <i class="calibre4">potiron</i> more closely, and especially</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its use in the i6th century.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the sense of 'mushroom' <i class="calibre4">potiron</i> was in use at least as far back as the I5th</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century, according to Albert Dauzat. This is the older meaning, antedating the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discovery of America. <i class="calibre4">Potiron</i> as a designation for gourds is confined to squashes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and pumpkins, and they are of New World provenience. In the i6th century</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these vegetables were called <i class="calibre4">courges d'Inde</i> and <i class="calibre4">courges d'outre-mer, but potiron</i> began</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. In the United States and Canada, the ordinary woodsman's word for any shelf fungus is 'conk', and because</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the shape of the growth, the word is supposed to come from 'conch'. But woodsmen do not know the molluscs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and are unlikely to turn to them for metaphors. The <i class="calibre4">Dictionary of American English</i> gives grounds for supposing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that 'conk' is a shortened form of'conkus' or 'konkus'. In the English counties from Lincolnshire to the Scottish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">border there has long been a word used for cucumbers: 'congers', 'cungers', and'conkers'. Is the American word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the fungus cognate with the name for the cucumber, and do we find here another example of the association</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of fungi with gourds? In the absence of a bettter etymology, we offer this as a conjecture, to be tested by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">further inquiry.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE GOURD CLUSTER</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to supersede those nonce names in the iyth century. If there was a metaphorical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">transfer, we must conclude that the New World squash suggested a mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the French and was therefore called a mushroom. This explanation seems to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have satisfied the philologists Albert Dauzat and Oscar Bloch, but it leaves</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us sceptical. To be fair we must point out that there is one small squash with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scalloped edges that in color and even in external texture might suggest certain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms. This is the kind of squash, a variety of cucurbita pepo, known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">formerly as the simlin or cymling and today as the patty pan squash or white</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bush scallop. A further circumstance might support the philologists' position. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French were discovering how to cultivate the <i class="calibre4">champignon de couche</i> at the very</p>

  <p class="calibre1">moment when they were learning to cultivate the squash, in the first half of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the iyth century, and there is reason to believe that the manured hills of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">squash-patch served simultaneously as mushroom beds. For centuries the country</p>

  <p class="calibre1">folk of some parts of western Europe had been encouraging the growth of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">various kinds of edible fungi by bringing about the conditions under which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they might spontaneously appear. In the iyth century it was known in France</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that parings of the psalliota campestris rejected in the kitchen could be thrown</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on horse manure with a reasonable expectation that they would produce a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">crop of mushrooms in the warm fermenting dung.1 As we have mentioned</p>

  <p class="calibre1">before on page 6, N. de Bonnefons described this practice for the first time</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in print in his <i class="calibre4">Le Jardinier fran^ois</i> in 1651, and he added the significant advice</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the beds prepared for melons could serve this double purpose. In our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mind's eye we can see the mushrooms growing in the same beds or hills with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">melons, pumpkins, and other gourds, and this was taking place at the very</p>

  <p class="calibre1">moment when <i class="calibre4">potiron,</i> an old word for 'mushroom', was beginning to be used</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the name for certain exotic gourds, lately introduced from overseas. It was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">therefore not unnatural for farmers to associate mushrooms with gourds. Further-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">more, the readiness of both squashes and mushrooms to putrefy rather soon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into a watery mess2 might have suggested a kinship that expressed itself in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. The use of fungal 'spawn' came later, as did the discovery that mushrooms lent themselves to cultivation in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">caves and cellars. But there is a baffling sentence in the <i class="calibre4">Satyricon</i> of Petronius Arbiter, written in the first century:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ecce intra hos dies scripsit, ut illi ex India semen boletorum mitteretur. [Loeb Library, p. 59] Within a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">few days, I may say, he has written for a cargo of mushroom seed from India. <i class="calibre4">If boletus</i> here carries its usual</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning of the Caesar's amanita, it indicates a mastery in the cultivation of these delectable mushrooms wholly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unknown today and never elsewhere mentioned in surviving records of ancient times.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. Shakespere uses 'squash' on several occasions. Thus in Act. m, Sc. i of <i class="calibre4">A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> Bottom is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">asking the names of various characters and from one learns that he is Pease Blossom, whereupon Bottom retorts:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I pray you commend me to Mistress Squash your mother</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and to Master Peascod your father.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Squash' as a name for the American gourd is derived from a Narragansett Indian word, and Shakespere could</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not have known the word and probably did not know the gourd. 'Squash' in the sense of'squeeze' is European</p>

  <p class="calibre1">129</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_123"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_57">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">use of the same name for both, a similarity in putrefaction that Sir Thomas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elyot pointed out in 1541 in the words that we quoted on page 19. All in all,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the evidence assembled in this paragraph would seem to offer an explanation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the dual use of <i class="calibre4">potiron.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">But let us not forget the suggestion inherent in the older forms of the word</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pepon</i> indicating that the association of gourds and mushrooms long antedated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the 16th century and the cultivation of the field mushroom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">J_ here is a source of promising evidence relevant to our theme of surprising and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fascinating quality in the still-life paintings of the Low Countries in the iyth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century. This was the epoch when the Flemish and Dutch schools were produc-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing innumerable canvases representing the foods of the times - fish, game, meats,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vegetables, fruits. The number of accomplished artists who devoted their talents</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to paintings of food is astonishing, and apparently they never tired of their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">theme. We have combed these still-lifes for mushrooms, and while of necessity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we cover only a small part of the source materials, it is clear that paintings of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">food with mushrooms are exceedingly rare. We have found only four, of which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not one is Dutch. All four are Flemish, or from the Catholic side of the religious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">line that bisected then as now the Low Countries. On a later page we shall revert</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the significant absence of fungi as food from paintings of the Dutch school.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of the four paintings we reproduce one by Jan Fy t, and details from a canvas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by Jan Davidsz. de Heem and from one by Adriaen van Utrecht. All three of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these painters were in the plenitude of their powers at the precise time when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">N. de Bonnefons was composing his book on gardening and describing for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the first time the preparation of mushroom beds. A fourth painting, attributed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the Antwerp artist Frans Snyders, shows a young market woman surrounded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by baskets of divers vegetables and fruits with one basket of ceps; it hangs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the art gallery at Schloss Pommersfelden, Germany. Snyders was a slightly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">older contemporary of the other three. Of this painting a iyth century variant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is in the Louvre. All four artists worked in Antwerp or Brussels.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The startling feature of the three paintings that we reproduce is that in all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">three we find <i class="calibre4">a. potiron</i> or squash, and in two the <i class="calibre4">potiron</i> is juxtaposed to mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms. In the light of the dual meaning of <i class="calibre4">potiron,</i> this juxtaposition justifies</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a conjecture that it was not accidental. Thanks to the gracious help of Dr. Hugh</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in origin, and specifically it meant for Shakespere an unripe pea pod or 'peascod'. The pea pod played a familiar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">role in amatory folklore in Shakespere's day, and 'peascod' was heavily charged with genito-urinary puns and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">symbols; cf. 'cod', 'codpiece', etc. Mistress 'Squash' invokes a parallel female metaphor equivalent to Shakespere's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">erotic use of 'medlar' in <i class="calibre4">Romeo and Juliet</i> and elsewhere. Though 'cod', as we have seen, sometimes meant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'puffbair, in Bottom's words there is no link with the fungal world or gourds.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre5">130</b></p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE GOURD CLUSTER</p>

  <p class="calibre1">C. Cutler, Assistant Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we can identify the squashes, and he points out that they are the only veget-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ables of New World provenience in these paintings. In the Van Utrecht the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">squash is the cucurbita moschata, and belongs to the variety now called Dickin-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">son Field pumpkin, familiar in the American Southwest and in central and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">southern Mexico. The squash in the Fyt is probably a cucurbita moschata but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">might be a pumpkin, i.e., cucurbita pepo. In Heem's painting we clearly find the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pumpkin. Both squashes and pumpkins may be called <i class="calibre4">potirons</i> in modern French.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As for the mushrooms, Snyders, Fyt, and Heem give us ceps; Van Utrecht</p>

  <p class="calibre1">offers us ceps and three apparently gilled mushrooms. If as we believe these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">latter are very ripe <i class="calibre4">champignons</i> or <i class="calibre4">roses,</i> they are the earliest known representa-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion of the common mushroom by an accomplished artist.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The mute testimony of these paintings is of extraordinary interest. It might</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seem probable that in the painters' minds the squash and mushrooms had an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">affinity for each other, and the squashes in question were certainly of American</p>

  <p class="calibre1">origin. At the same time the mushrooms painted by them as food were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chiefly boleti, and boleti never grew in a pumpkin patch. Clearly the <i class="calibre4">champi-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">gnon de couche</i> played little or no role in the market places of Flanders and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Brabant, and the affinity of mushrooms with the squash was unrelated to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom beds described by Bonnefons. The cucurbitaceae painted by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Flemish artists did not include the patty pan squash, with its superficial resem-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">blance to a mushroom. <i class="calibre4">Potiron</i> in the sense of'mushroom' has never been known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Walloon dialect of French.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The key to the four Flemish paintings is to be found in Franciscus van Ster-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beeck's <i class="calibre4">Theatrum Fungorum,</i> published in Antwerp in 1675, the earliest book</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dealing solely with mushrooms. The author never refers to the still-life painters,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who were his older contemporaries, but he divulges a precious item of ethno-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycological lore. He informs us that the Flemings were mycophobes until</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the beginning of the iyth century, at which time certain Italian merchants</p>

  <p class="calibre1">came to take up residence in Flanders, and by their example they showed that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms could be eaten. They launched a vogue for this novel victual, gather-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing mushrooms themselves, importing dried ones from Italy and Burgundy,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and teaching all and sundry how to distinguish the many good kinds from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bad. In fact, Van Sterbeeck's treatise is itself a tribute to this budding myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">philia, written by an enthusiast to spread the good tidings, the first of hundreds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of such missionary efforts brought out in the mycophobic North in the past</p>

  <p class="calibre1">three centuries. As there was no Flemish word to designate mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suitable for the dining room, the Flemings had lately borrowed <i class="calibre4">kampernoeljes</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">131</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_125"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_58">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">from, the French dialect spoken in nearby Picardy,1 and applied it to all the edible</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kinds, especially ceps. Afterwards it gave way to <i class="calibre4">champignons.</i> We reproduce the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">frontispiece of Van Sterbeeck's work, with its quaint commentary on early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophagy among the Flemings. The author portrays himself in a bust at the top</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the architectural design, helpfully telling us that his age was 44. On one side</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of him are effigies of happy infants nourished doubtless on the wholesome fungi;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the other side the corresponding amori are in acute distress from the other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kind. Below we see two gentlemen responding to aggressive selling tactics of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom vendors. We suspect that the vendors on the right are ready to sell</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the evil wares descending from the wretched infants above.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For Van Sterbeeck, for Jan Fyt and his colleagues, mushrooms were a novelty</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like the squashes from the New World. This must have been one reason for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">juxtaposing them. Just as the Italians brought mycophagy to Flanders, so they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">may have been addicted to the new-fangled gourds. Indeed, Italian artists may</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have suggested to the Flemings the very theme for the paintings that we are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discussing. Already in the i6th century the Italian painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was giving eloquent expression to the same idea.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arcimboldo was born in 1527 and died in 1593. He delighted in allegorical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">figures representing the Seasons, the Four Elements, and the cardinal points</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the compass, which he would contrive to represent by an ingenious ar-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rangement of fruits, vegetables, meats, animals, fishes, or utensils, his selection</p>

  <p class="calibre1">harmonizing with his allegory. We reproduce one of his paintings, a reclining</p>

  <p class="calibre1">figure that embodies the spirit of Autumn. Until a few years ago it belonged</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to a parish church near Brescia, and it now hangs in the Pinacoteca of that city,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not far from Milan. However deficient Arcimboldo was in intellectual and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">emotional depth, he was an accomplished craftsman, and this painting constitutes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a document of singular value for the ethno-botanist. Most of the vegetables and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fruits are of Mediterranean provenience, including the medlars of which no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fewer than four are present. The egg plant had been lately introduced into Italy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the East. The tuberoses in the figure's hair, the squashes, and the maize</p>

  <p class="calibre1">come from America, the first two from Mexico. The maize is of a Mexican</p>

  <p class="calibre1">variety also, though it could come from further south.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our painting is undated, but perhaps we can fix with reasonable certainty the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">period of its execution. From 1562 to 1587 Arcimboldo lived in Central Europe,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">except for a visit to Milan in 1566. Both by its traditional location and by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">artist's choice of vegetables and fruits, it is clear that the painting was done in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. The use in the Low Countries <i class="calibre4">of kampernoeljes</i> dates back at least to 1567, for we find it cited in Hadrianus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE GOURD CLUSTER</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Italy. From what we know about the arrival in Italy of the exotic plants that we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">find in the painting, it is far more likely that the artist worked on it after 1587</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than before 1562. This means that it was a product of his last years, between</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1587 and his death in 1593. These were the very years when potatoes were be-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coming known in northern Italy, and their absence from our painting favors an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">early date within these permissible limits. For the past half century ethno-bota-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nists and cultural historians have been studying the impact on the Old World</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the plants discovered in the New, especially tobacco, potatoes, and maize.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To document the first phases of these profound innovations they have combed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the writings of the explorers and historians, and searched through the i6th</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century herbals. The herbalist Leonhard Fuchs in his <i class="calibre4">De Historia Stirpium,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">published in 1542, was the first to offer his readers a picture of maize, a woodcut.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thereafter such woodcuts appeared in almost all herbals, often copied not from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">life but from a preceding herbal, and often deficient botanically. For workers in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this field the i6th century still-life painters offer an additional source of evidence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that seems to have been ignored. We do not know whether our <i class="calibre4">Autumn</i> by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arcimboldo is the earliest still-life with maize, but we submit that his painting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of it is incomparably superior to any pictures of maize that have hitherto been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pointed out from the i6th and even I7th centuries. The artist's eye was truer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than the herbalist's, his technique superior to the woodcutter's.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our own interest in the Arcimboldo lies in his mushrooms. Mycophiles will</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be delighted with the clavaria that serves the recumbent Autumn for beard and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mustachios. In the middle of the left thigh is an <i class="calibre4">ovolo</i> or Caesar's amanita. These</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are the earliest mushrooms known to us that we can say are well painted, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their like was not to be seen again for a full half century. We now draw our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reader's attention to the proximity of the squash to the <i class="calibre4">ovolo,</i> and that squash</p>

  <p class="calibre1">happens to be the very one that, on an earlier page, we likened in texture and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shape to mushrooms. It is the squash of American provenience variously called</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the cymling, the patty pan, and the white bush scallop. What urge prompted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the artist to place mushroom and squash together ? The scallop was an exotic, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Italy the edible mushroom was not. Must we fall back on an accidental</p>

  <p class="calibre1">juxtaposition as our only resort; Or do we discover here an expression, possibly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. For data about Arcimboldo's life we have relied on Benno Geiger's monograph, <i class="calibre4">Dipinti ghiribizzosi di</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Giuseppe Arcimboldo,</i> Florence, 1954. Plates 47, 52, 54, and 69 contain mushrooms. One of these hangs in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida, and another of them is the one we reproduce.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A painting by Arcimboldo that closely parallels the one in Brescia is owned by Edward James, Esq., of Chich-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ester, England, who has kindly furnished us with photographs of it. (Geiger mentions but does not reproduce this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">work.) In this variant the clavaria plays the same role. Instead of an <i class="calibre4">ovolo</i> in the thigh, we discover two <i class="calibre4">ovoli,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">each constituting a cheek of the recumbent god. For the early history of maize in Europe we turned to John J.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Finan's study, 'Maize in the Great Herbals', published in 1948 in the <i class="calibre4">Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">only half conscious on the artist's part, of an ancient association of ideas, such</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as we adumbrated earlier and will shortly pursue further? But before we revert</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to that theme, we shall conclude our discussion of the mushroom-gourd link</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in iyth century paintings by briefly mentioning another aspect under which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms and gourds were viewed together, the aspect that led Sir Thomas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Elyot in 1541 to warn the readers of his <i class="calibre4">Castel ofHelth</i> to beware of'musherons,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">. . . gourds, and al other thinges, whiche wyll sone putrefie'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A favorite theme of some iyth century still-life painters in the Low Coun-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tries was the transitory nature of all living things, the vanity of this world as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">contrasted with the eternal values of the next. In a private collection known to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us there is a painting by Cornelis de Heem, son of Jan Davidsz. and identified</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the Dutch school, in which this <i class="calibre4">vanitas vanitatis</i> chord finds graceful ex-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pression. A shaft of light penetrates from an aperture above to a sepulchral</p>

  <p class="calibre1">setting where a lovely flower arrangement is juxtaposed to a bisected gourd</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and some growing mushrooms. Unfortunately we have been denied permis-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sion to reproduce this extraordinary canvas. The mushrooms are in a shadow</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and scarcely lend themselves to identification. They are not pictured as food,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but instead as the symbol of decay and death. From the glory of the flowers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in their beauty the eye passes to the doomed segment of the disintegrating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">melon and on to the fungal expression of the grave. In this painting putrefaction</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and death are the meanings that underlie both gourd and mushroom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If we are right, there emerged in the iyth century new reasons for associat-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing mushrooms and gourds. But the association in men's minds was far older.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some indications of this older tradition seem to emerge in the ancient writers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Take for example the work known in English as <i class="calibre4">Etymologies</i> composed by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">St. Isidore of Seville around A.D. 600. He has occasion to list the vegetables</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with all their names. Is it by chance that immediately after the cucumbers <i class="calibre4">(cu-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">cumeres)</i> and gourds <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">(cucurbitce)</b></i> he adds <i class="calibre4">the fungi</i> and <i class="calibre4">tubera</i> or truffles;1 Athenaeus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the second book of <i class="calibre4">The Deipnosophists</i> also discusses numerous vegetable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">foods, and what is our surprise to discover that here also the comments on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms and truffles follow hard upon the paragraphs dealing with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gourds! It is a commonplace of reference works that the order of the alphabet</p>

  <p class="calibre1">constantly juxtaposes disparate words and ideas, but the alphabet offers us no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">explanation for the sequence of vegetables that we find in St. Isidore and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Athenaeus. Pliny is yet another witness to the tie that binds mushrooms to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gourds. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE GOURD CLUSTER</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a sentence in his <i class="calibre4">Historia Naturalis</i> hitherto unremarked by commentators and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ignored by the editors of Liddell &amp; Scott's Greek lexicon, he tells us, in Book</p>

  <p class="calibre1">XX, in the chapter that discusses the gourd <i class="calibre4">(cucurbita),</i> about a wild gour/1,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hollow, on which he says the Greeks have bestowed the name <i class="calibre4">spongos,</i> a gourd</p>

  <p class="calibre1">growing only on stony soil, of which the walls are of the thickness of a finger,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which when chewed yields a juice wholesome for the stomach.1 Here then in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ancient times is a wild gourd that shares with sponges and mushrooms a name</p>

  <p class="calibre1">belonging to the cluster of basic words for the fungal tribe. The dual function</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of <i class="calibre4">potiron</i> in the ryth century was a revival and not an innovation, and we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">believe that in the root of the Latin word <i class="calibre4">pepo</i> we shall find mushrooms and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gourds conjoined.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1 hroughout the Slavic lands there is a distinctive name for the common field</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom. It takes various forms, but in the Ukraine it is <i class="calibre4">pecheritza, andpecharka</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">may be taken as a typical variant in other Slavic countries. The uniformity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of this name throughout the Slavic world and its invariable application to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">common field mushroom are remarkable evidences of its antiquity: it must</p>

  <p class="calibre1">antedate the dispersion of the Slavs and the differentiation in Slavic languages.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Lithuanians do not use the word, nor do the Germanic peoples; but the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jews of Eastern Europe have adopted it in Yiddish, and refer to a girl dressed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">up 'like a <i class="calibre4">pecheritza',</i> as an American might say, 'like a Christmas tree'. With</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a transposition of consonants, the word has been taken into both Rumanian,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ciuperca,</i> and Magyar, <i class="calibre4">csoporke.</i> Its derivation has never been clear. Some have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggested that it came <i class="calibre4">frompechora,</i> meaning a cave, since the psalliota campestris</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lends itself to cultivation in cellars and caves. But this is unacceptable, for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the wild field mushroom does not grow in caves and its artificial cultivation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">began in France only after the year 1700. Others have suggested a derivation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from <i class="calibre4">peek',</i> meaning oven, and gone on to assume that <i class="calibre4">the pecheritza</i> was nor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mally roasted. This is hardly satisfying, for the field mushroom lends itself</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to roasting no better than other kinds, and furthermore in the whole rich</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom vocabulary of Europe there is no other name derived from a method</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of culinary preparation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But let us take another look at that Slavic word <i class="calibre4">peek',</i> 'oven'. It is cognate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the Greek itsztov, the Latin <i class="calibre4">pepo,</i> whence through the French <i class="calibre4">pepon</i> to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the English 'pumpion'. These are ah1 of ancient and well attested lineage, com-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. Many editions of Pliny give <i class="calibre4">somphos</i> instead <i class="calibre4">of spongos</i> as the name of this wild gourd. For our purpose the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">difference in words is unimportant, since they are cognate. According to the footnote of L. Desfontaines com-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">menting on this textual question (Paris, 1829, vol. 6 of an edition with commentary by various hands, Bk. XX,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chap, vii [iii]), all Pliny rnss. carry <i class="calibre4">spongos.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing down to us from an Indo-European root that the French philologists Ernout</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Meillet reconstruct as pekwo, which became kwekwo in the Italian peninsula</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in Celtic. The Latin <i class="calibre4">coquo,</i> meaning to cook, and all its kin and progeny are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of this family. Whether <i class="calibre4">cucuma</i> and <i class="calibre4">cucumis</i> belong here, we do not know, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">even if they do not, a semantic blend is possible, for cookery is the common</p>

  <p class="calibre1">denominator of them all. Baking and roasting and cooking are the ideas that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">underlie the root. That which is baked rises, expands, swells, grows brown</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and ripe and mature. It is therefore not surprising to discover that from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">earliest times the word carried a second related meaning, the idea of 'ripening</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the sun'. As Ernout and Meillet say, "La notion de 'maturite' est liee a la</p>

  <p class="calibre1">racine depuis 1'indo-europeen." Whence the application to gourds, and - we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">submit - to that species of mushroom, the psalliota campestris, which comes to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">maturity in the open fields under the sun. Pumpkins and these mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">swell and ripen in the sun. The Provencal <i class="calibre4">concourlo,</i> meaning both field mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room and pumpkin, is a breath-taking word, for in its specific application to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the field mushroom we witness the toughness of a semantic theme running</p>

  <p class="calibre1">through long stretches of time and space.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If our argument prove sound, we have established from evidence gathered</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Eastern Europe the explanation for the link between mushrooms and gourds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that crops out in the French <i class="calibre4">potiron</i> and in the Provencal <i class="calibre4">coucourlo.]ust</i> as we have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">earlier established what we call <i class="calibre4">apogge</i> cluster of mushroom words, and a sponge</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cluster, so now we discover the existence of a gourd cluster. All three appear</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to go back to Indo-European roots that resemble each other and that convey</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same innermost idea of a growth or swelling. But only the first of these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clusters directly involves the frogs and toads. In the French <i class="calibre4">word potiron,</i> wherein</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms are called pots, metaphorically speaking, the attentive mind catches</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a recurrence of the semantic theme that we found in the Indo-Aryan languages,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where a Sanskrit word for 'pot' or jar' has fathered numerous progeny among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fungal words of various languages, the theme of the gourd, the swelling</p>

  <p class="calibre1">organism.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rlere we might end this section, were it not that in the Basque language we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover an amazing thing. In the Labourdin dialect of Basque the name of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">common field mushroom is <i class="calibre4">paratxiko,</i> the <i class="calibre4">-tx-</i> in Basque being pronounced</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like 'ch' in 'cheek'. By a transposition of consonants we arrive at the Slavic</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pecharka,</i> with identical meaning! This is not all. In various parts of Europe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there has always been a tendency for the name of the best known species of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom to be used as a word for mushrooms generally. If, as seems likely,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE GOURD CLUSTER</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the general word used for mushrooms in Basque, <i class="calibre4">perretxiko,</i> is a variant of</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">paratxiko,</i> this would indicate that when the Basques acquired the word, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">field mushroom was for them the dominant species. It is clear that these words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cannot be native to the Basque language, for no native words begin with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the letter p. In Catalonia <i class="calibre4">paratge</i> circulates as a mushroom name, but its specific</p>

  <p class="calibre1">application seems to be variable; we suggest that this Catalan word was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">borrowed from Basque. How then does it come about that the Basques use a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word that seems to lend itself to identification with a Slavic term?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">After pondering this curious question for some time, it occurred to us that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Gypsies could have borrowed the Slavic word and then, in the course of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their wanderings, delivered it to the Basques. There are numerous lexicons of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the various dialects of Romany, but none of them seem to have been composed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by scholars interested in mushrooms. In the end we addressed a blind inquiry to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that specialist in all matters pertaining to Gypsies, the Irish scholar Walter Starkie,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whose experience with the Gypsies goes back over forty years. The reader will</p>

  <p class="calibre1">imagine our surprise and pleasure when we learned for the first time from Dr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Starkie's reply that the Gypsies are great lovers of all kinds of edible mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and that one mushroom name used by the Spanish Gypsies is <i class="calibre4">perrechitesl</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">This is not of course a conclusive explanation of the Basque word. We should</p>

  <p class="calibre1">learn more about that Gypsy term - over how much of Europe the Gypsies</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use it, and what variations it manifests. The fact that the Gypsies are myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">philes is important. If the fruits of recent scholarship are sound, the Basques are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">linguistically related to the Caucasian peoples, and all the Caucasian peoples are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophobes; this is true at least of the Georgians, Mingrelians, and Svanetians,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and of the Circassians and Ossetians and Chechens, among whom we have had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">an opportunity to locate informants. The mushroom vocabulary of the Basques</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is reasonably rich, but consists mostly of borrowed or translated words, as though</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they too had once been mycophobes. The Basque country has long been a habitat</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for Gypsies. A people like the Basques not steeped in mycophagy is unlikely</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to bestow on the mycophilic Gypsies an important word for mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and perhaps least of all a word that is itself a loan word in Basque. On the other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hand, mycophilic sojourners in the Pyrenees might have given to the Basques</p>

  <p class="calibre1">some lessons in mycophagy. Our hypothesis, after we formulated it, has received</p>

  <p class="calibre1">startling collateral support in an observation volunteered to us by a Swedish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">friend, the banker Frithiof Ahren. "I have been told", said he, "that the Gypsies</p>

  <p class="calibre1">taught us in Sweden to eat mushrooms, in times when food was scarce."</p>
