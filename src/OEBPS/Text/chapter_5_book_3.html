  <p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre5">In</b>&nbsp;the Middle Ages the French viewed the toad somewhat differently from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the English, and in this section we shall digress briefly to clarify the distinction.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With the French the emphasis was not directly on the venom but on the crea-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ture as an incarnation of Satan.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Old French there was a curious word,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">le lot,</i>&nbsp;which according to the dictio-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">naries meant 'toad', and they add that it fell into disuse in the 15th century.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For a time it lingered on in a single phrase:&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">enfle comme une bote,</i>&nbsp;'blown up like a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">female toad', a phrase that beyond the Loire had already become&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">enfle comme un</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">crapault.</i>&nbsp;(The female is much bigger than the male, and the older simile thus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">carried a double superlative.)&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Bot</i>&nbsp;in the sense of toad survives to this day in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">many regional dialects of France and also in the Italian&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">botta.</i>&nbsp;The word in a dif-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ferent meaning still circulates in standard French, in the fossilized term,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pied</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">bot,</i>&nbsp;'club foot'. What links toads to club feet?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The origin of this word is not in doubt.&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Bot</i>&nbsp;comes down from a Germanic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">root meaning 'blunted', 'malformed', 'clumsy'. It exists in an English form:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the pudgy, clumsy hands of babies are 'puds', as are the forefeet of certain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">animals. 'Puddifoot' is a family name, originally a nickname for a cripple.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But why should a toad, with its delicately articulated extremities, be called a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cripple ?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We believe that the history of this little word is a chronicle of successive meta-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phors, and that its primary role was as a euphemism for Satan. The Foul Fiend in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Middle Ages possessed certain sharply defined attributes. He wore horns.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He had a tail. For hands he showed claws. He was enveloped in the hairy hide of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">an animal. He was sometimes represented as glorying in shameless priapism.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Finally, he was a cripple, one leg ending either in a club foot, or a splayfoot,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or a bird's talons, or a paw, or a hoof- a cloven hoof. To this day horns and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cloven hoof are familiar metaphors for wickedness in English. There are low</p>

  <p class="calibre1">circles in which 'cripple' serves as an epithet of singular viciousness, beyond</p>

  <p class="calibre1">anything that mere lameness justifies. Eric Partridge in his&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Dictionary of Slang</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">cites what he calls a senseless phrase used by English schoolboys to spur their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">teammates to greater efforts: " Go it, you cripple!" Sometimes the language of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">children preserves words and phrases that have disappeared among adults,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and we believe these schoolboys are in hopes that the very Devil will possess</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the players on their side. Perhaps our suggestion explains another folk belief</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that is still current, the notion that cripples are capable of more than normal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sexual prowess.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the first instance, then,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">le hot</i>&nbsp;meant 'the Cripple', a euphemism for Satan.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In this sense it survived into the i6th century in the oath,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Vrai lot! -</i>&nbsp;'by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">very Devil'. Elizabethan England borrowed this French oath intact. The Oxford</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dictionary gives as its earliest citation the following, dated 1584: "A bots on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thy motley beard!", and the final citation is from 1719:</p>

  <blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
    <p class="calibre1">Bots on them all Both</p>

    <p class="calibre1">great and small!</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">Unaccountably, the Oxford Dictionary says the origin of 'bots' is unknown.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Satan's sinister limp seems to have vanished today from men's memories. It</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was vanishing already in Napoleon's time. His coadjutor Talleyrand, notorious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for his loose life and lack of scruples, limped from his earliest years; and this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">physical deformity did not escape his enemies, who dubbed him&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">le (liable boiteux,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">'the limping devil'.&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">(Boiteux,</i>&nbsp;by the way, is unrelated etymologically to&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">le hot.)</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In ear her times either the noun or the adjective would have been redundant. An</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English caricaturist devised a satirical coat of arms for Bonaparte, supported</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on either side by a Devil, on the right by the Corsican Devil with a cloven hoof,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and on the left by Talleyrand, the French Devil, with a reptilian extremity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Was it not Talleyrand's distinction to be the last major figure with a limp</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whose infirmity was held against him as a demonic stigma? We reproduce</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this savage print in our Plate No. XX.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the next stage,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">le lot</i>&nbsp;underwent a shift from Satan himself to the creatures</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into which he was supposed to transform himself- the toad, a certain kind of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nocturnal bird, and bats.2 The nightjar, kin to the American whippoorwill, was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known in parts of France up to recent times as&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">le hot volant,</i>&nbsp;and also as&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">le crapaud</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">volant,</i>&nbsp;names so layered with metaphors that they could be fairly translated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in any of three ways, the flying Devil, the flying Cripple, and the flying Toad.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Even more interesting is the widespread use of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">le hot volant</i>&nbsp;for the bat, a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">creature that was formerly steeped in sinister associations. Its nakedness, its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">blackness, its miraculous agility in night flight, its facial features stretched taut</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. A parallel for&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">hot</i>&nbsp;is to be found perhaps in&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bratze,</i>&nbsp;a colloquial name for the toad reported in Bavaria, which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">can mean 'paw', 'claw', 'clumsy foot'. But&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bratze</i>&nbsp;must be considered in conjunction with certain other words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the toad: Bavarian&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">braste,</i>&nbsp;suggestive of the lamenting cry of the toad; the Bavarian&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">broz</i>&nbsp;and the Austrian</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">brotze</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">braitling,</i>&nbsp;these relating to the swelling of the toad.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. It is permissible to conjecture that the Germanic etymon of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">hot,</i>&nbsp;in the sense of a rough lump, attached itself</p>

  <p class="calibre1">directly to the toad, rather than through the mediation of Satan. There might even be a kinship with the Dutch</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">padde,</i>&nbsp;the English 'pad' and 'paddock'. But the application of the word to the nightjar and to bats is proof that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in France in the Middle Ages the idea of Satan was uppermost.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">81</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in a subhuman grimace, the strange profile of its wings with their articulated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">struts, its vampirish repute - all these attributes caused it to be feared and loathed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the very Devil himself, and justified medieval man, in his own eyes, in putting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bats to death, whenever caught, by methods of hideous cruelty, similar to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">treatment accorded to toads.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The English word 'bat' for the flying rodent is first recorded in the year 1523.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Formerly the creature had been a <i class="calibre4">bakke,</i> and philologists have been at a loss to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">explain the irregular mutation in its ending. Have they not been looking in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the wrong direction? Surely Tudor England borrowed the new word 'bat'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from France, altering the vowel under the attraction of the native Middle English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word. (The same vowel change was to take place shortly afterwards in God's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name: in the profanity of the iyth century 'God' by a euphemistic mincing of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the vowel became 'Gad'.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Old Boots' is one of the names by which the Devil has been known in English.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Is it not a popular adaptation of 'bots'? When Bella, in <i class="calibre4">Our Mutual Friend,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">calls her husband a 'Clumsy-Boots',1 is not Dickens, all unawares, recapturing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for us a faint echo of the stumping Cripple's awkward limp, now sugared down</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into a loving pet-name? Then there is Puss-in-Boots, <i class="calibre4">le Chat Botte,</i> the fairy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tale that Charles Perrault first put on paper late in the iyth century, in which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a cat displays superhuman acumen when shod in boots. Do we not detect here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a punning echo, come down from much earlier, of the demonic Cripple's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">prowess ?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Demonic possession connotes mental disturbance, and we think this is why</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'bat' in English, especially in slang, is linked with lunacy. 'Bats' is a vulgar word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for delirium tremens, and those who go 'on a bat' indulge in wild behavior,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">while the man with 'bats in the belfry' is quite 'batty'. If we are right, all these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words, full of vigor in the spoken language, stem back to <i class="calibre4">le bat,</i> the limping</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arch Cripple.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Satan today has degenerated into a pallid personification of evil. In the Middle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ages he was no abstraction, no mere Idea. He was hot flesh and blood. Miss</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Margaret A. Murray in her studies of witchcraft has shown that his bestial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attributes - the horns and hoof, the claws, hide, and tail - were those of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">celebrant in the nocturnal rites of the witches' coven, the rites belonging to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">religion of the Horned God, as she calls this divinity, the autochthonous religion</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Europe and the Near East which slowly gave ground before Christianity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and on which in its expiring throes the triumphant enemy bestowed the conde-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. Part iv, Chap. xi. For a study of names used for the Devil in English, see Charles P. G. Scott, 'The Devil and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE CRIPPLE, THE TOAD, AND THE DEVIL</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scending name of witchcraft. The master of the ceremonies was known to his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">followers by many names, such as Robin Goodfellow in England. On the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tongues of his enemies in the Christian Church Militant he was Satan and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If Miss Murray is right, we are discussing a religion practiced by our ancestors</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for thousands of years, which expired just yesterday, and which we can now</p>

  <p class="calibre1">study only through the eyes of the Church that was its deadly foe, and through</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clues such as we are here discussing. It is not surprising that when Hieronymus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bosch painted his famous <i class="calibre4">Seven Deadly Sins,</i> the successive scenes swarm with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toads, the incarnation of Satan, as well as other reptiles. We reproduce one of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these vignettes, representing the sin of Pride or <i class="calibre4">Superbia,</i> with a peacock fittingly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">present. Satan in the shape of a great man-like toad holds up a mirror to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">worldlings.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Queen Elizabeth's reign, probably before 1588, there was published in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">England a poem entitled <i class="calibre4">The Mad Pranks and Merry jests of Robin Goodfelloiv,l</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4"><br /></i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. The pamphlet was republished privately by the Percy Society, London, in 1840, using the text of the 1628</p>

  <p class="calibre1">edition, with commentary by J. Payne Collier, Esq., F.S.A., on whose information we have relied.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">It seems to have appeared in a long succession of editions, of which the earliest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known to survive bears, we believe, the date 1628. The verses are of little worth,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but they and the illustration that accompanies them are valuable as one of the few</p>

  <p class="calibre1">spontaneous expressions of the witchcraft cult emanating from within the circle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of sympathizers. Here is the Horned God in proud panoply, <i class="calibre4">le Bot</i> in action.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here is Robin Goodfellow, Hob-goblin, Will the Wisp, Mad Crisp. No</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms appear in the woodcut that illustrates the 1639 edition, which we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reproduce, but their presence offstage may be inferred, for we are told that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Robin was sired by Oberon, whose fungal attachments we shall shortly point</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out. The witches of the coven are dancing in a 'fairy ring', but there is no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence that these rings, where the grass grows differently, were linked with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms before the iSth century. In the poem we learn that Oberon had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been looking for his offspring high and low:</p>

  <blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
    <p class="calibre1">At last upon a summer's night</p>

    <p class="calibre1">King Oberon found him out, And</p>

    <p class="calibre1">with his elves in dancing wise</p>

    <p class="calibre1">straight circled him about, The Fairies</p>

    <p class="calibre1">danc't and little Tom Thumb</p>

    <p class="calibre1">on his bag-pipe did play And thus they</p>

    <p class="calibre1">danced their fairy round</p>

    <p class="calibre1">till almost break of day.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">The artist who carved the woodcut, though crude in his technique, conveyed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his message effectively. In the heavens fly two black birds, and he took sufficient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pains for their silhouettes to be unmistakable. They are none other than nightjars,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sometimes called goatsuckers or night ravens. These are the <i class="calibre4">lots volants</i> of evil</p>

  <p class="calibre1">augury, the sinister birds that held our ancestors in dread fascination:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">doth use for to call Men to</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Death's haven.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="calibre1">The toad appears as a visual symbol of Satan and the pagan god in French</p>

  <p class="calibre1">iconography in the late Middle Ages. One of the most famous episodes in early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French history was the conversion of King Clovis to the Christian faith. His</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wife Clotilde was a Christian, but he resisted the attractions of the new creed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">until he fought the battle of Tolbiac in the year 496. When the battle was going</p>

  <p class="calibre1">against him he swore that he would abandon the old religion if the Christian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">God would give him victory. The tide turned, and shortly thereafter he was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">baptized by St. Remi at Reims.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In that city there survive a number of tapestries woven in the I5th and early</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">16th centuries that depict the life of King Clovis. They show him fighting at</span><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tolbiac as a pagan clothed in a surcoat adorned with toads, under a standard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bearing the heraldic emblem of toads. The creatures are pictured as from above,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their legs spread-eagled. In the next scene, where St. Remi is giving instruction</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the King, the heraldic toads vanish. In the third scene the king is baptized,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">while high above the font an escutcheon appears bearing fleurs de lis, as though</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to give a stamp of lofty approval to the happy event. Nearby a dove descends</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bearing the holy ampulla with the oil for the king's anointing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Heraldic emblems did not come into use until about A.D. noo, and the tapes-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tries in Reims are therefore an anachronism, a didactic invention of the Middle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ages.1 Toads never figured in the arms of any French king. But those who de-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">signed these tapestries were not guilty of mendacity. It was their purpose to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">convey a simple message to the unlettered laity, and how better could the con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">version of King Clovis be taught through pictures than by showing the pagan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">king waging war under Satan's banner? Here the symbols have come full circle:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the beginning the Foul Fiend was <i class="calibre4">le Bot -</i> the Cripple - and then this name</p>

  <p class="calibre1">jumped to the demonic toad, and now the toad, commonly known as <i class="calibre4">le. hot,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">stands for the club-footed Fiend. Heraldic creatures are mythical at best, and here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we have myth compounding myth, a legend about a symbol that never was.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The belief in Clovis's toads circulated chiefly among lowly and unlettered folk,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"par le vulgaire et par le menu peuple", and <i class="calibre4">le hot</i> flourished in the same milieu.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We believe that we are the first to direct attention to the demonic multi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">valence of 'the Cripple' in medieval France, but the evil emanations of toads are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">well known. Dirk Bax, for example, in his recent book on Hieronymus Bosch2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">points out their malign meaning for this painter. He reminds his readers of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">old belief that witches could transform themselves into toads. He recalls the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">papal bull published in the year 1233 by Gregory IX wherein toads were called</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the symbols of the Devil and magic. He reports an episode in 1610 when a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French <i class="calibre4">sorrier</i> discovered a cast in the left eye of a child, the cast taking the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shape of a toad's leg, and the child confessed that Satan had imprinted this <i class="calibre4">sig-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">num diabolicum</i> with his horn. According to an authority that Dr. Bax has found,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">St. Anthony beheld Satan in the shape of a toad with a human head, and if we</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. For a sceptical and charming discussion of these toads, see Claude Fauchet's <i class="calibre4">Origines des Chevaliers, Armoiries,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">et Heraux,</i> Paris, 1600, p. 17. See also C. Leber's <i class="calibre4">Collection des Meilleurs Dissertations, Notices et Traites Particuliers</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">relatifs a I'Histoire de la France,</i> Paris, 1838, vol. xiii, pp. 198 ff. Leber quotes from Scevole de Sainte-Marthe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(1572-1650), and the evidence indicates that the popular belief in the heraldic toads of the pagan French kings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">goes back at least to the beginning of the I5th century. From the i6th century to the 18th we find in both</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English and French sources frequent references to Clovis's heraldic toads. Today they are forgotten by almost</p>

  <p class="calibre1">everyone, even historians.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. <i class="calibre4">Ontcijfering van Jeroen Bosch,</i> The Hague, 1949, p. 33, where the author also gives the sources for his state</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ments.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;"><br /></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">accept the assertions of yet another writer, the toads in Hell torment the sinners,</span><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in turn are food for the damned. To this day, Dr. Bax says, the Flemings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">believe that toads spit venom, just as Bosch shows us in <i class="calibre4">The Last Judgment.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">From Simin Palay's recent dictionary of the dialects of Gascony and Beam</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we learn that in former days the Gascons spoke of a cast in the eye as a 'toad'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">— <i class="calibre4">crapaud</i> — and considered it a distinctive sign of the witch and sorcerer. Here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is that same <i class="calibre4">signum diabolicum</i> which Dr. Bax reported from a different source.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A cast in the eye is a painless blemish, but it reminds us of the <i class="calibre4">paddescheet</i> of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Dutch, that stye, inflamed and stinging, which people call the toad's excre-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ment. Suddenly there dawns on us a lively and sinister meaning behind these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">faint folkloric hints linking toads with the human eye. In the days of the Old</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Religion in western and northern Europe, the toad gripped the imagination</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of our ancestors with a dread fascination such as the serpent has always exercised</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the East and in India to this day. Yes, in cultural history the toad was the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">European equivalent of the serpent in the East. On its face strange, the folkloric</p>

  <p class="calibre1">link between toads and the human eye becomes clear if our surmise be right</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the venom of the toad was deliberately used by the priests of the ancient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cult to inflame the eyeballs, and thus heighten the awesome spell of the rites.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here may lie the reason why a genuine stye suggests the toad's secretion, why</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the cast in someone's eye was for the beholders the reminder and sign of demonic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">power.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By now the reader may fairly ask what our discussion of Satan and <i class="calibre4">le hot</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">has to do with the problem of the toadstool. In brief, toads figure in both the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English and the French fungal vocabulary, but the figure of speech in English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">emphasizes poison, whereas in French demonic possession plays the dominant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">role. In the former, the 'toadstool' is a blanket malediction on all wild fungi,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all of which are erroneously suspect as 'poison-stools'. In the latter, the <i class="calibre4">crapaudin</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">(like the Basque <i class="calibre4">amoroto]</i> is the name for a particular species, and this species is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not one of the deadly mushrooms. It is the amanita muscaria, the mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that intoxicates and exhilarates, that gives hallucinations. It is the mushroom of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">demonic possession. Bad as are both Satan and poison, there is a difference</p>

  <p class="calibre1">between the two. The whole world rejects poison, but Satan always has a goodly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">following. Unlike lethal poison, Satan is seductive. There is thus a distinction</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the inner meaning between the toxic 'toadstool' and the demonic <i class="calibre4">crapaudin.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The distinction is in the emphasis: the associations of the two terms overlap</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but do not coincide.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If our interpretation of <i class="calibre4">le bot</i> is correct, why do we not find this word figuring</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in France's fungal vocabulary? The answer is that we do. Eugene Rolland in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the battle of Tolbiac, his instruction in Christian doctrine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by St. Remi, and his baptism. Woven in 1531.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">his <i class="calibre4">Flore Populaire</i> reports <i class="calibre4">bo</i> as a designation for gilled mushrooms in the Haute</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inner meaning becomes obvious now for us. It would be well for specialists</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in French provincialisms to concentrate on <i class="calibre4">bo</i> and <i class="calibre4">botet,</i> to determine whether</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they still survive and where and with what precise fungal application and in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what contexts. In the center and south of France there are regions where <i class="calibre4">bou-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tarel, boutareu,</i> and <i class="calibre4">boutairoual</i> are general words for 'mushroom'. They also mean</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the langue d'oc 'barrel' and 'basket', but we suspect that in the sense of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'mushroom' they are a popular corruption of <i class="calibre4">boterel,</i> a diminutive of <i class="calibre4">le bot</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">that is not uncommon in France as a family name. A close scrutiny of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French dialects will certainly uncover additional links, until now unnoticed by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scholars, between toads and mushrooms. On page 73 we mentioned the Gallic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word for 'toad', <i class="calibre4">craxantus,</i> obsolete these many centuries. Does it perhaps sur-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vive in the Gascon name used for the despised and rejected boleti whose flesh</p>

  <p class="calibre1">turns blue on exposure to air — <i class="calibre4">craaue-maudit,</i> which would then mean 'the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cursed toad'?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vve conclude, then, that mushrooms and toads were linked together in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">France in former times as part of a cluster of folk beliefs having a demonic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nucleus. The link was strongest, it seems, north of the Loire and faded out as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one approached the Mediterranean. Apparently it stemmed from the Germanic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or Celtic cultural strata that antedated Mediterranean influences, strata steeped</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the blackest mycophobia. And this leads vis again to Hieronymus Bosch.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One of Bosch's powerful paintings is the <i class="calibre4">Hay Wain,</i> to be seen in the Prado.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is a large triptych, and in the central panel, almost unremarked hitherto by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">commentators, there stands forth a giant boletus. So far as our inquiries have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gone, this mushroom was the first significant representation of a fungus1 after the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ancient fresco of Herculaneum (which we reproduce on Plate LXXVI), a lapse of</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. The <i class="calibre4">Bulletin</i> of the Societe Mycologique de France in 1911 (vol. xxvii, p. 31) announced to the mycological</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world the discovery of a I3th century fresco representing the temptation of Eve. The mycologists who focused</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their attention on this fresco persuaded themselves that the Tree of Good and Evil had been portrayed by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the artist as an amanita muscaria. The fresco, which we visited in the summer of 1952, is in a disaffected chapel</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in France, in the Berry, between Ingrandes and Merigny, near the Chateau de Plaincourault. The style is Ro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">manesque, and this fits the date that the edifice bears - 1291. Since the initial announcement there have been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">numerous references to the fresco in mycological publications; e. g., <i class="calibre4">The Romance of the Fungus World,</i> by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">R. T. and F. W. Rolfe, London, 1925, p. 291; also John Ramsbottom's <i class="calibre4">Mushrooms &amp; Toadstools,</i> pp. 46-7 and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">illustration facing p. 34; also <i class="calibre4">The Illustrated London News,</i> Nov. 21, 1953. The mycologists would have done</p>

  <p class="calibre1">well to consult art historians. The Plaincourault fresco does not represent a mushroom and has no place in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discussion of ethno-mycology. It is a typical stylized Palestinian tree, of the type familiar to students of By-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">zantine and Romanesque art. The German art historians have even devised for this oft-repeated motif the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">technical designation of <i class="calibre4">Pilzbaum.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">more than fourteen centuries. Let us see if we can arrive at the meaning of this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">extraordinary mushroom, so boldly painted, at first glance so enigmatic.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The <i class="calibre4">Hay Wains</i> left-hand panel, of which we reproduce the upper part on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Plate XXXVI, depicts with idyllic beauty the momentous events that took place</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Paradise in the Beginning, up through the final scene where the Angel of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lord drives Adam and Eve forth from Eden into the wilderness. The right-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hand panel depicts Hell. The central panel is occupied chiefly by a huge load of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hay, which is the dominating feature of a procession that enters the scene from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Paradise on the left and disappears on the right heading for Hell. The wagon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is being hauled by a miscellany of grotesque creatures who are personifications</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Sins. With a dead switch the Devil in the foreground drives on these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">monsters. The withered branch, as always in Bosch's symbolism, signifies cursed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sterility, recalling the withered vine of Christ's homily. Sceptred king and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mitred churchmen with their trains follow the hay-wagon, which as it progresses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">crushes little men like a juggernaut. Jesus looks down in anguish from Heaven,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and a strange group of merry-makers disport themselves a-top the hay.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The hay wain represents pleasure, but it remained for Mr. and Mrs. Nicolas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Galas of New York, in the course of their studies of Bosch, to discover the precise</p>

  <p class="calibre1">text that is illustrated, a passage in a book with which Bosch was familiar,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Gregory the Great's <i class="calibre4">Morals on the Book of Job,</i> written after A.D. 600. In Book</p>

  <p class="calibre1">32, paragraph 7, Gregory is commenting on the Vulgate text of Job 40: 4</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(King James Version, Job 40: 9):</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As he says by the Prophet, 'Behold, I will shriek over you, as a cart creaketh laden</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with hay' [Amos 2: 13], for since the life of the carnal is hay, as it is written 'All flesh is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hay' [Isaiah 40: 6], in that the Lord endures the life of the carnal, he declares that he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">carries hay as a cart. And to creak under the weight of the hay is for Him to bear, with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">murmuring, the burdens and iniquities of sinners. [Vot. 3, Part 2, p. 514, of the English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">translation by J. H. Parker et al., published in Oxford, 1844-1850]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the right in front of the wagon the great procession is joined by a small</p>

  <p class="calibre1">confluent stream of people pouring from a door-way as the hay-wagon ap-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">proaches their earthly abode. They too are damned souls, as is declared by their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">leader's reaching up for carnal hay on the wagon, and by another branch,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">withered and cursed, that holds up the trapdoor of the habitation out of which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this secondary stream emerges. In the door can be seen the peephole used by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inmates when the door is closed. In our opinion the doorway gives access, not to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cave, but to a turf-covered dwelling, of which the roof rises to a clearly identifi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">able peak, made by the upright post that is presumably the structural support</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the primitive structure. On the left of that peak there lies a fruit, symbol of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">man's First Fall. On the right stands our mushroom. Bosch has painted not a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom, but a gigantic effigy, a mushroom sculptured in stone or wood. It</p>

  <p class="calibre1">represents a boletus, perhaps the boletus satanas, a species that to this day is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">popularly associated with Satan in Central Europe. The light color of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">painted mushroom effigy is not significant, for it is the color of the material</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in which the mushroom is sculptured. The stem is covered with flecks like</p>

  <p class="calibre1">goose-flesh. The cap is disproportionately small, and from it emerges again</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the withered branch of the Biblical curse.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have seen that in i6th century France mushrooms were called <i class="calibre4">pain de</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">crapault,</i> 'toad's bread', a term that has been reported in modern times in Nor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mandy. Contemporaneously, at the time of the Renaissance, the corresponding</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name in Flemish and Dutch was <i class="calibre4">duivelsbrood,1</i> 'devil's bread', a term now ob-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">solete in the standard language, but historically documented in the larger Dutch</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Flemish dictionaries. These two expressions, 'toad's bread' and 'devil's bread',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">superficially using different metaphors, are in essence perfect translations one of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the other, for as we have seen 'toad' and 'devil' are synonyms. The effigy of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom that Bosch the Dutchman painted was the effigy of the Devil's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bread, and the people who lived at the Sign of the Devil's Bread were bread</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the Devil.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our mushroom effigy is then a pictographic embodiment of a popular</p>

  <p class="calibre1">metaphor, and proclaims the curse that lies on the household dwelling within.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This interpretation receives surprising support from an otherwise inexplicable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">detail of the painting. The base of the mushroom shows two flattened surfaces.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bread always bears the imprint of the vessel in which it is baked, and here we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover the beveled faces left by the Devil's bread-pan. How obvious this must</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have been for Bosch's neighbors in the Low Countries!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There remains a crucial question: why did Bosch introduce into this sermon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in paint the minor tributary stream of Hell-bent sinners, emerging from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">House of the Devil's Bread? Clearly this rather crowded detail of his exhortation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the carnal sins was not a capricious fancy. He was asserting something, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what; Here is our conjecture. The main stream of sinners is recruited from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christian community, as evidenced by the trappings of the leaders. The tri-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">butary stream is fed by folk similarly damned but who have not belonged to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Christian fold. The Devil is the hot-blooded Devil of the witches' covens.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The people crowding forth from the hovel do not lend themselves to a precise</p>

  <p class="calibre1">count but they are about thirteen, the full complement of a witches' coven with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. See Hadrianus Junius' <i class="calibre4">Nomendator,</i> Paris, 1567, p. 144, where the word is spelled <i class="calibre4">duyuehbroot;</i> also the history <i class="calibre4">of</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">ray may be right that a culturally distinct people, autochthonous, unlettered,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and pagan, lived side by side with the Christian world in northern Europe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">down into Renaissance times. But whether that people existed or not, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">belief in them existed and was generally accepted, and Bosch presents those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cursed outcasts to us under the Sign of the Devil's Bread, a sinister and myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phobic Sign that marks for us the initial emergence of the mushroom world</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into the documentary annals of northern Europe.2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strangely disturbing, on the back of the wings of the <i class="calibre4">Garden of Delights,</i> there are two unmistakable mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">possibly three, all in the left-hand panel. Elsewhere we find shapes that suggest mushrooms, perhaps intended</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by Bosch to do so; e.g., one such shape in the left-hand panel of the <i class="calibre4">Garden of Delights</i> and two in the central</p>

  <p class="calibre1">panel, the table in the <i class="calibre4">Cure for Folly,</i> and various 'puckfist' shapes elsewhere. The demonic symbolism of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the medieval world the fairies were sinister beings, at least in orthodox</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eyes, and down to recent times the flavor of the old belief could still be detected</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Sussex, where 'fairy rings' long continued to be called 'hag tracks'. By the end</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the 16th century the fairies had become the dulcified sprites of modern usage</p>
