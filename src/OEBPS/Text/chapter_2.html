  <section>
    <p><span class="initial">T</span>HERE is no doubt about it: from, earliest times the English have had little use for mushrooms. The Crete Herball of 1526, a translation from the French, voiced the hostility of both peoples:</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
      <p>Fungi ben mussherons. . . There be two maners of them; one maner is deedly and sleeth them that eateth of them and be called tode stooles, and the other dooth not. They that be not deedly haue a grosse gleymy [slimy] moysture that is dysobedyent to nature and dygestyon, and be peryllous and dredfull to eate &amp; therefore it is good to eschew them.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>In the 16th century scientific thought had hardly begun to shake itself loose from folk-beliefs of unfathomed antiquity, and compilations such as The Crete Herball are a treasury of such beliefs. The printing press, fresh on the scene, captured and preserved for us the common content of men's minds at that&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">moment in history when the Western World was beginning its slide into the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">modern era of big changes. And in the case of mushrooms, let us here salute&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">a singular example of the tenacity with which even a great people sometimes&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">clings to its primitive notions. For that naive division of the mushrooms between</span></p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>the 'two maners of them', the one deadly and the other not, and even these</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>latter to be avoided - that elemental antipathy, captured for us in the text</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>of the first comprehensive English herbal, has carried on with undiminished</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>vigor through four centuries more, down to the present day. Learned myco-</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>logists write treatises and preach an enlightened gospel, but what do all their</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>knowledge and all their cautious advice weigh? Small cliques of amateurs</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>exist, but the public is not stirred. In a recent elaborate American work on</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>mushrooms the author1 brings himself to write a chapter on 'mycophagy',</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>but confesses that he himself almost never lets mushrooms enter his mouth!</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>Not thus does one inspire appetite in others. The repugnance for 'toadstools'</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>I. Alexander H. Smith in his Mushrooms in their Natural Habitats (Sawyer's Inc., Portland, Oregon, 1949) says as he engages in a lengthy discussion of mycophagy, pp. 121-2: "It is impossible for me to discuss the edibility of even the highly recommended species authoritatively from my own experience since I seldom eat them myself".</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">is sometimes an aggressive thing. I have seen the English governess, her charges</p>

    <p class="calibre1">in tow, advance on the enemy (a lovely and innocent russula, as it happened),</p>

    <p class="calibre1">kick it over, and with shudder and grimace crush it with the heel of her big,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">low-heeled shoe; turning then to the children, she shepherded them away</p>

    <p class="calibre1">from the unclean thing. Thus by an unspoken lesson this creature unwittingly</p>

    <p class="calibre1">seared their young minds with the branding iron of an ancient curse. Where</p>

    <p class="calibre1">she and her tribe see, in the words of the herbalist, a slimy toadstool, a Russian</p>

    <p class="calibre1">beholds 'the fat of the earth'.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">As the 16th century drew to a close, in 1597, John Gerarde brought out his</p>

    <p class="calibre1">famous <i class="calibre4">Herball or General! Historie of Plantes,</i> an immense and delightful book.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">What he says of mushrooms may differ little in substance from <i class="calibre4">The Crete</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Herball,</i> but his opulent manner of expressing the same thing deserves the ac-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">colade of the reader's attention. The Englishman is venturesome in most things</p>

    <p class="calibre1">save food, and never before Gerarde nor since has that peculiar dietary conserva-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">tism of the race received more elegant and curious endorsement:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Many wantons that dwell neere the sea, and haue fish at will, are for change of diet to</p>

    <p class="calibre1">feede vpon the birds of the mountaines; and such as dwell vpon the hils or champion</p>

    <p class="calibre1">grounds, do long after sea-fish; many that haue plenty of both, doe hunger after the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">earthie excrescences, called mushrums; whereof some are very venemous and full of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">poison; others not so noisome; and neither of them very wholesome meate . . .</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Master Gerarde then proceeds to describe one kind that is not bad and straight-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">way a dozen that he condemns, saying about a certain species that grows in</p>

    <p class="calibre1">"mossie and shadowie woods" that he does "the more briefly passe them ouer,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">not purposing to vse many words about such fruitlesse matters". Finally he</p>

    <p class="calibre1">comes to his sweeping and memorable conclusions:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Galen amrmeth that they are all very colde and moist, and therefore do approoch vnto a</p>

    <p class="calibre1">venemous and murthering facultie; and ingender a clammie, pituitous, and colde nutriment</p>

    <p class="calibre1">if they be eaten.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">To conclude, fewe of them are good to be eaten; and most of them do suffocate and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">strangle the eater. Therefore I giue my simple aduice vnto those that loue such a strange</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and newefangled meates, to beware of licking honie among thornes, least the sweetenes</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of the one do not countervaile the sharpnes and pricking of the other.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">[pp. 1384-6 of first edition]</p>

    <p class="calibre1">A few years after Gerarde, in 1609, Sir Michael Scott said his say about</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushrooms in <i class="calibre4">The Philosophers banquet,</i> and here and now we give to his words</p>

    <p class="calibre1">new wings:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">. . . Sow-beard1 or Mushrome, according to Rasis [the Arabian physician] is cold and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">grosse, and being taken raw ingenders flegme, and the chollike, and windinesse in the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">guts; neither is it to be eaten but with hot sauce or meate, but the red are not to be eaten</p>

    <p class="calibre1">at all. The Todestoole is much worse then the Mushrome: for it hath choaked and killed</p>

    <p class="calibre1">many that haue taken it, and the best that it doth, is to breed flegme in the body in</p>

    <p class="calibre1">aboundance . . . [Verso of folio 36, wrongly numbered 33]</p>

    <p class="calibre1">These famous herbalists whom I have quoted were leaning on the authority</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of Dioscorides, Galen, and Rhazes, but they elaborated richly on their sources,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">going far beyond the Greek and Arabic writers in maligning the mushroom</p>

    <p class="calibre1">tribe, and invoking the oracles only to clothe with their authority the loathing of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the English, which they undertook to express in their full-bodied prose.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Half a century after Gerarde it was still possible for a well-born and educated</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Englishman to reach man's estate without having heard of truffles. John Evelyn</p>

    <p class="calibre1">at the age of 24 made their acquaintance in France. On September 28, 1644,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">he found himself in Vienne, a day's journey by river from Lyons, and there,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">as he says in his diary, he "supped and lay, having amongst other dainties, a</p>

    <p class="calibre1">dish of truffles, which is a certain earth-nut, found out by a hog trained to it,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and for which those animals are sold at a great price. <i class="calibre4">It is in truth an incompar-</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">able meat."</i> (The emphasis is mine.)</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The Englishman in Evelyn was being diluted by travel. His hospitality to</p>

    <p class="calibre1">strange and newfangled meats found no echo in his countryman Jeremy Taylor,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">who in 1650-1, in his <i class="calibre4">Holy Living and Dying,</i> strikes the less liberal note:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Fly from all occasions, temptations, loosenesses of company, balls and revellings,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">indecent mixtures of wanton dancings, idle talk, private society with strange women,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">starings upon a beauteous face, the company of women that are singers, amorous gestures,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">garish and wanton dresses, feasts and liberty, banquets and perfumes, wine and strong</p>

    <p class="calibre1">drinks, which are made to persecute chastity; some of these being the very prologues to</p>

    <p class="calibre1">lust, and the most innocent of them being like condited [seasoned] and pickled mushrooms,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">which, if carefully corrected and seldom tasted, may be harmless, but can never do good.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">[Chap. 2, 'On Christian Sobriety', Sec. in, 'Remedies against Uncleanness']</p>

    <p class="calibre1">It was Jeremy Taylor's privilege to believe in the mortification of the flesh,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">but why did he vent his spleen on the humble mushroom? I hope to show</p>

    <p class="calibre1">on a later page that he and the herbalists were voicing, unbeknownst to them-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">selves, a pre-Christian tabu shared by all the peoples who dwell on the shores</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">I. Sow-beard = sow-bread; unreported in the Oxford Dictionary in this sense of mushrooms, but familiar as a</p>

    <p class="calibre1">name for the cyclamen. In Latin <i class="calibre4">tuber</i> meant both 'truffle' and 'cyclamen', and in Giuseppe Baretti's Italian-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">English dictionary, 1832, <i class="calibre4">tartufo</i> is translated by 'sow-bread, a kind of mushroom growing underground'. The</p>

    <p class="calibre1">addiction of pigs, especially sows, to underground fungi justified the use of this name for truffles.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">of the North Sea. The passage about the condited and pickled mushrooms</p>

    <p class="calibre1">follows hard on another that perhaps my readers will thank me for recalling.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The stern author is listing his remedies against 'uncleanness', and here is what</p>

    <p class="calibre1">he recommends about food in general:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">A spare diet, and a thin coarse table, seldom refreshment, frequent fasts, not violent,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and interrupted with returns to ordinary feeding, but constantly little, unpleasant, of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">wholesome but sparing nourishment: for by such cutting off the provisions of victual,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">we shall weaken the strengths of our enemy.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Is it uncharitable to venture the opinion that this exhortation to consume</p>

    <p class="calibre1">unpleasant food, from Jeremy Taylor's day even unto now, has been more</p>

    <p class="calibre1">honour'd by his countrymen in the observance than the breach?</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Apparently the Stuarts on recovering the throne of England brought back</p>

    <p class="calibre1">with them from across the Channel an appetite for the mushroom world.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">How else shall we explain that before the end of the century the Englishman</p>

    <p class="calibre1">was commonly referring to the good earthy 'trubs' ? A little later both truffles</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and morels began to figure in the cookbooks. For example, Patrick Lamb,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">who was for "near fifty years" master-cook to Charles II, James II, William and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Mary, and Queen Anne, in his <i class="calibre4">Royal Cookery or the Compleat Court-Cook</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1">(London, 1726) includes in his menus mushrooms (which he fails to identify),</p>

    <p class="calibre1">morels, and truffles. In the extracts filling five volumes that have been published</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of Parson James Woodforde's prodigious diary, he refers repeatedly to pickled</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, to truffles, to morels. Toward the end of the i8th century they</p>

    <p class="calibre1">had become a regular feature of this country clergyman's fare, brought to</p>

    <p class="calibre1">his door by the folk who had gathered them. Gilbert White in his <i class="calibre4">Observations</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">on Vegetables</i> reports that a truffle-hunter had called on him "having in his</p>

    <p class="calibre1">pocket several large truffles" found in the neighborhood of Selborne; the man</p>

    <p class="calibre1">was offering them to him at half a crown a pound. White speaks casually</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of the dogs that the truffle-hunter was using to smell out the truffles. It is clear</p>

    <p class="calibre1">that truffle hunting was no novelty for him. One might have expected to</p>

    <p class="calibre1">find the gentlemen of England in that urbane century relishing the table deli-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">cacies familiar to the French and Italians; and since they were also steeped in</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the classics, they must have known of the addiction of the epicures of ancient</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Rome to mushrooms. But it is startling now to discover from the casual</p>

    <p class="calibre1">observations of two rural clergymen that the English rustics in their time</p>

    <p class="calibre1">were gathering morels and truffles for the market. In the whole of the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">English-speaking world today, does there survive a single truffle-hunter e</p>

    <p class="calibre1">(Truffles grow in America also, but few pay attention to them, rarely even</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the mycologists. They are one of the New World's still untapped resources.)<br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">That strange false dawn of mycophagy which marked England's i8th century</p>

    <p class="calibre1">even attained expression in art when Thomas Gainsborough painted his <i class="calibre4">Mush-</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">room Girl,</i> a sample of bucolic sentimentality typical of its time and milieu.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Is not this the only occasion in the history of English art when a painter of the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">first rank has acknowledged the existence of the fungal world ? And in this case</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the basket filled with field mushrooms is only a detail in the composition,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">an excuse for a title. There exists in a private collection a second work by</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Gainsborough with the same title, a wholly different composition, showing a</p>

    <p class="calibre1">child, close up, as she reaches out for mushrooms growing in a field.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Having once taken hold, why did this Arcadian pursuit, so noble in its simpli-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">city, die out? Morels and truffles added variety to the Englishman's fare, but</p>

    <p class="calibre1">they were destined to vanish from his table in the course of the strange decay</p>

    <p class="calibre1">that overcame the English cuisine in the glorious Victorian era. In 1847 the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mycologist Badham was saying of mushrooms that "England is the only country</p>

    <p class="calibre1">in Europe where this important and savoury food is, from ignorance or preju-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">dice, left to perish ungathered."1 Half a century later,in 1891, another mycologist</p>

    <p class="calibre1">who bore the arresting name of Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, in a delightful treatise</p>

    <p class="calibre1">on the edible fungi pointed out that "in the time of our grandfathers it was</p>

    <p class="calibre1">almost universally believed that our islands produced but one kind of fungus</p>

    <p class="calibre1">which was edible."2 His words implied a growth in enlightenment in his own</p>

    <p class="calibre1">lifetime that few other observers have detected either then or since his day.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Apart from occasional remarks in the writings of mycologists, the English</p>

    <p class="calibre1">have paid little attention to their blindspot concerning mushrooms. So far as</p>

    <p class="calibre1">I know, even among the mycologists only one has done justice to the subject,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">inveighing against his countrymen's prejudice -William Delisle Hay, who pub-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">lished <i class="calibre4">An Elementary Text-book of British Fungi</i> in London in 1887. His voice</p>

    <p class="calibre1">crying in the solitudes deserves to be recalled. Speaking of the fungi near the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">beginning of his book, he says:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Among this vast family of plants. . . there is but one kind that Englishmen con-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">descend to regard with favour. All the rest are lumped together in one sweeping con-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">demnation. They are looked upon as vegetable vermin, only made to be destroyed. No</p>

    <p class="calibre1">eye can see their beauties; their office is unknown; their varieties are not regarded; they are</p>

    <p class="calibre1">hardly allowed a place among nature's lawful children, but are considered something</p>

    <p class="calibre1">abnormal, worthless, and inexplicable. By precept and example children are taught from</p>

    <p class="calibre1">earliest infancy to despise, loathe, and avoid all kinds of 'toadstools'. The individual who</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">1. A Treatise on the Esculent Funguses of England,</i> p. vii.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">2. British Edible Fungi,</i> p. 17.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">desires to engage in the study of them must boldly face a good deal of scorn. He is</p>

    <p class="calibre1">laughed at for his strange taste among the better classes, and is actually regarded as a sort</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of idiot among the lower orders. No fad or hobby is esteemed so contemptible as that of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">'fungus-hunter' or 'toadstool-eater'.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">This popular sentiment, which we may coin the word 'fungophobia' to express, is very</p>

    <p class="calibre1">curious. If it were human - that is, universal - one would be inclined to set it down as an</p>

    <p class="calibre1">instinct, and to reverence it accordingly. But it is not human - it is merely British. It is so</p>

    <p class="calibre1">deep and intense a prejudice that it amounts to a national superstition. Fungophobia is</p>

    <p class="calibre1">merely a form of ignorance, of course; but its power over the British mind is so immense,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">that the mycologist, anxious to impart the knowledge he has gleaned to others, often meets</p>

    <p class="calibre1">with scarcely credence or respect. The superstition strikes deep. He who would write or</p>

    <p class="calibre1">lecture about Fungi can scarce find readers or hearers. The English scientist investigates</p>

    <p class="calibre1">every domain of nature, but leaves this one coldly alone. The English medical man</p>

    <p class="calibre1">disdains to inquire into the chemical constitution of Fungi, and is indifferent to and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">unknowing of their relations in regard to medicine, toxicology, diet, or hygiene. It is</p>

    <p class="calibre1">surely high time that English intelligence should rise superior to this peculiar phase of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ignorance. . . .</p>

    <p class="calibre1">It is a striking instance of the confused popular notions of Fungi in England, that hardly</p>

    <p class="calibre1">any species have or ever had colloquial English names. They are all 'toadstools', and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">therefore are thought unworthy of individual baptism. Can anything more fully de-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">monstrate the existence of that deep-rooted prejudice called here 'fungophobia'; . . . In</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the countries of the Continent the greater number of species have each their particular</p>

    <p class="calibre1">local names. Even the Redskin of America and the Maori of New Zealand have specific</p>

    <p class="calibre1">names for their common Fungi. Only we prejudiced Britons have none.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">More than six decades have passed since the above lines were penned, and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">though the English-speaking world has produced numbers of good mycologists</p>

    <p class="calibre1">since then, the substance of the indictment is as true today as when William</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Delisle Hay raised his voice in protest.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Hay could have cited Charles Darwin to illustrate his point. This observant</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and knowledgeable scientist, in that supreme book of travel, his diary of the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">voyage of H. M. S. BEAGLE, remarked in the entry for June i, 1834, that the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">natives of Tierra del Fuego relied on a certain arboreal fungus (a species of the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">genus cyttaria) for an important part of their diet; and then, almost as though</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to supply me with a singularly happy illustration for my argument, our learned</p>

    <p class="calibre1">young man showed the limitations of his learning. "At the present time," said</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Charles Darwin in 1834, "I think Tierra del Fuego is the only country in the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">world where a cryptogamic plant [i.e., a fungus] affords a staple article of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">food." The young Charles Darwin knew more about the Fuegians than about</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the northern Slavs and Catalans.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">As to mycophagy, Darwin revealed a strange lapse in knowledge that amount-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ed to a failure of perception. In him the mycophobia of the English was a mild</p>

    <p class="calibre1">affliction, a recessive trait. Sometimes this racial infirmity erupts with terrifying</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ferocity. Let the reader consider the following quotation from Mrs. Gwen</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Raverat's <i class="calibre4">Period Piece,</i> a book of Victorian reminiscences published in 1953.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Here we learn what mushroom gathering a 1'anglaise can sometimes mean, to</p>

    <p class="calibre1">what mad purpose the gentle art of mushroom knowing may be perverted:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular THE</p>

    <p class="calibre1">STINKHORN, though in Latin it bears a grosser name [the phallus impudicus, of course].</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Etty's great invention: armed with a basket, and a pointed stick, and wearing a special</p>

    <p class="calibre1">hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">there, her nostrils twitching, when she caught a whiff of her prey; then at last, with a</p>

    <p class="calibre1">deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her bas-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest</p>

    <p class="calibre1">secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; <i class="calibre4">because of the morals of the maids.</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1">[pp.135-6]</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Who was Aunt Etty ? She was Charles Darwin's daughter!</p>

    <p class="calibre1">In all the enchanted pages about England's rural life that W. H. Hudson</p>

    <p class="calibre1">gave to the world around the turn of the present century, there are scarcely</p>

    <p class="calibre1">a half dozen references to mushrooms. Once he conveys in a sentence or two</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the magic spell cast on the perceptive beholder when he first discovers a 'fairy-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ring' - those meadow mushrooms that ofttimes grow in perfect circles, the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">circles expanding by tiny stages each year through decades and even perhaps</p>

    <p class="calibre1">centuries. Elsewhere Hudson speaks of his having gathered mushrooms, but</p>

    <p class="calibre1">from the colorless reference it seems clear that he was speaking only of the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ordinary field mushroom. Thus even Hudson, with ah1 his sensibility to nature,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">never opened his eyes to the mushroom world.1</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Thoreau did somewhat better. His allusions in <i class="calibre4">Walden</i> are trifling, but in his</p>

    <p class="calibre1">superb <i class="calibre4">Journals</i> he speaks of the fungi time and again. In passages of luminous</p>

    <p class="calibre1">beauty he vibrates to their visual appeal: suddenly he is off with a theme like</p>

    <p class="calibre1">this: "The most interesting domes I behold are not those of Oriental temples and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">palaces, but of the toadstools." He ponders over and over again on the strangeness</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of these lowly organisms. He philosophizes, and with his teetotaler's bias not</p>

    <p class="calibre1">always happily: "The life of a wine-bibber is like that of a fungus..." In all that</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Thoreau says of the mushrooms, for a Russian something is lacking. He views</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the mushrooms as he contemplates the stars, without touching or smelling or</p>

    <p class="calibre1">tasting them. Not once does he convey to the reader a carnal sensation. Somehow</p>

    <p class="calibre1">i. <i class="calibre4">The Hind in Richmond Park,</i> Chap, ix; <i class="calibre4">The Book of a Naturalist,</i> Chap. xv.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">we cannot picture Thoreau greedily stirring a stew of savory mushrooms over</p>

    <p class="calibre1">his stove in his hermitage at Walden; that man's saliva never runs. There is</p>

    <p class="calibre1">something of the eunuchoid aesthete about him. He is too pure to be fun.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">But a similar insensibility afflicts even those whose business it is to discuss</p>

    <p class="calibre1">culinary matters. As recently as 1943 an eminent American gourmet in a book</p>

    <p class="calibre1">about food declared that there were two schools when it came to preparing</p>

    <p class="calibre1">fresh mushrooms for the table - those who peeled them and those who didn't.1</p>

    <p class="calibre1">For the Russians, how irrelevant is this 'either-or' dichotomy as a key to the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">culinary possibilities of the multitudinous world of the mushrooms! It is as</p>

    <p class="calibre1">though a critic of music should say that when it comes to making music, there</p>

    <p class="calibre1">are two schools of performers - those who stand and those who sit. Whenever</p>

    <p class="calibre1">there is discussion of Russian cooking, it is easy, by a few discreet inquiries about</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, to discover those who know whereof they speak.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Ihe herbals of old served as botany books, medical books, and cookbooks;</p>

    <p class="calibre1">they were not composed as contributions to the <i class="calibre4">belles lettres.</i> It might be thought</p>

    <p class="calibre1">that in the flood-tide of English literature, the poets with their heightened</p>

    <p class="calibre1">insight would have shown themselves aware of the sensuous beauty of the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushroom world. Not at all. On this subject the English poets missed their</p>

    <p class="calibre1">chance to be emancipators. Chaucer and Milton ignore the mushrooms, and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">so I think does Wordsworth, the poet of nature and humble things. Thomas</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Gray seems to have overlooked those that adorned his country churchyards.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Robert Burns brings them in, but only once, in his verses to William Creech,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and they serve merely to turn a rime:</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">Now gawkies, tawpies, gowks, and fools. . .</p>

    <p class="calibre1">May sprout like simmer puddock stools;</p>

    <p class="calibre1">'puddock' meaning toads.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">Shakespere refers perfunctorily to mushrooms once, in <i class="calibre4">The Tempest,</i> and in</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Troilus and Cressida</i> a character dismisses another with 'Toadstool!' as an epithet.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Indeed, for Shakespere the two words serve little use beyond swelling his</p>

    <p class="calibre1">already immense vocabulary count. Apparently 'toadstool' was an accepted</p>

    <p class="calibre1">term of abuse in the lyth century: William Penn in the hot flush of his then</p>

    <p class="calibre1">recent religious conversion denounced the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford as 'Thou</p>

    <p class="calibre1">poor mushroom!' - a form of address that a Russian would surely misconstrue</p>

    <p class="calibre1">as a term of endearment.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">In the 18th century the British continued to belabor the poor fungal tribe with</p>

    <p class="calibre1">a cold, unrelenting hate marvelous to see. Tobias Smollett in 1757 produced in</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Drury Lane an extravaganza called <i class="calibre4">The Reprisal; or, the Tars of Old England,</i> a</p>

    <p class="calibre1">feeble satire on patriotism and the conventional ideas about the French. The</p>

    <p class="calibre1">villain is the commanding officer of a French frigate, on whose ship the action</p>

    <p class="calibre1">is laid. He is a "musty, vain, French martinet", a ridiculous cad, and he carries</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the name of Monsieur le Marquis de Champignon!</p>

    <p class="calibre1">For this aspersion on mushrooms Smollett was to be repaid in kind, and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">with interest. He published his famous <i class="calibre4">Travels through France and Italy</i> in</p>

    <p class="calibre1">1766, a narrative memorable for its angry comments on everything that the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">irascible Scottish physician saw and experienced. The critics took him to task</p>

    <p class="calibre1">especially for his inability to perceive any artistic virtue in the Pantheon or the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Medicean Venus. Two years later, almost as a riposte to Smollett's book, Lau-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">rence Sterne brought out his sensationally successful <i class="calibre4">Sentimental journey,</i> and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">there near the beginning he pays his compliments to Smelfungus, the pseudonym</p>

    <p class="calibre1">that he bestows on Smollett and that Smollett to his dying day never lived down.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The name is a key to the Englishman's attitude toward mushrooms: knowing</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Smollett as we do and Sterne's feelings about him, we discover what fungi</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and their smell meant for them and for Sterne's popular following. The earthy</p>

    <p class="calibre1">smell of decaying leaves and compost heap, of dank mushrooms growing in</p>

    <p class="calibre1">rich clusters, the smell that the French call 1'odeur du terreau, is pleasing to all</p>

    <p class="calibre1">who love simple and genuine things. Moreover, the mushroom tribe in fact</p>

    <p class="calibre1">offers the widest range of smells, not just one and that one foul. Indeed, as</p>

    <p class="calibre1">connoisseurs know, each species breathes its individual olfactory signature.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">There was of course a phonetic echo of Smollett's name in Sterne's insulting</p>

    <p class="calibre1">epithet, the kind of punning suggestion that Sterne loved.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Here, then, is salacious Sterne on Smollett:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The learned <i class="calibre4">Smelfungus</i> travelled from Boulogne to Paris - from Paris to Rome - and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">so on-but he set out with the spleen and jaundice, and every object he pass'd by was</p>

    <p class="calibre1">discoloured or distorted -. He wrote an account of them, but 'twas nothing but the account</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of his miserable feelings.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">I met Smelfungus in the grand portico of the Pantheon - he was just coming out of it -</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">'Tis nothing but a huge cock-pit,</i> said he - I wish you had said nothing worse of the Venus</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of Medicis, replied I - for in passing through Florence, I had heard he had fallen foul upon</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the goddess, and used her worse than a common strumpet, without the least provocation</p>

    <p class="calibre1">in nature.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">I popp'd upon Smelfungus again at Turin, in his return home; and a sad tale of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">sorrowful adventures had he to tell, "wherein he spoke of moving accidents by flood and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">field, and of the cannibals which each other eat: the Anthropophagi" - he had been flea'd</p>

    <p class="calibre1">alive, and bedeviled, and used worse than St. Bartholomew, at every stage he had come at --</p>

    <p class="calibre1">I'll tell it, cried Smelfungus, to the world. You had better tell it, said I, to your</p>

    <p class="calibre1">physician.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">In his next paragraph Sterne takes another traveler to task, some Croesus</p>

    <p class="calibre1">whom he dubs Mundungus, a word, now fallen into disuse, that meant 'offal',</p>

    <p class="calibre1">'refuse', 'filth'. A few years later, in the lySo's, Sterne's Smelfungus and Mun-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">dungus turn up again, in a satirical poem, <i class="calibre4">The Children of Thespis,</i> by 'Anthony</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Pasquin', the pen-name of a shady journalist named John Williams. He too</p>

    <p class="calibre1">vents psychopathic loathing on the inoffensive fungi:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Thus scarceness gives value to dirt and mundungus,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">And dignifies that Nature meant as a fungus.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">But fungus and filth have their uses and buyers,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Hence oceans of urine are purchas'd by dyers;</p>

    <p class="calibre1">And lawyers, who liv'd but to generate strife,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">May serve when they're dead for th'Anatomist's knife.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Let not the squeamish reader shrink from the stench of Sterne's Smelfungus:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">it curls upward from the very viscera of the Englishman's mycophobia. Contrast</p>

    <p class="calibre1">that smell, if you please, with the Russian's scale of values. On August 22, 1851,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Alexej Konstantinovich Tolstoy penned a letter1 from the country to the young</p>

    <p class="calibre1">woman whom he later married and his subject was the odor of mushrooms:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">I have just returned from the forest where I went gathering mushrooms and found</p>

    <p class="calibre1">many. Once you and I discussed how odors evoke the memory of things forgotten for</p>

    <p class="calibre1">many a year. For me the smells of the forest possess this faculty more than any others,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">but perhaps this is only because I passed my whole childhood in the woods. Just now I</p>

    <p class="calibre1">smelled a <i class="calibre4">ryzhik,</i> and as in a flash of lightning I saw my whole childhood, in all its</p>

    <p class="calibre1">details, up to the age of seven. The vision came and was gone in a thousandth part of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">a second. Each kind of mushroom has its own odor, but always it brings back to us</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the past . ..</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The common English names for the wild plants are rich in poetry, and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">perhaps no English poet of standing has made use of a wider variety of such</p>

    <p class="calibre1">names than John Clare, the farm-laborer who passed most of his adult life</p>

    <p class="calibre1">within the confines of a lunatic asylum. Yet in the two volumes of poor Clare's</p>

    <p class="calibre1">published poems I have discovered only one casual reference to 'mushroom</p>

    <p class="calibre1">buttons'. True, most of his verses still lie unpublished, and we must not exclude</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the possibility that this observant and original rustic poet somewhere paid</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">I. See his collected works, <i class="calibre4">Sobranie Sochinenii Izdanie,</i> St. Petersburg, 1908, edited by A. F. Marks, vol. iv, p. 37.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">fitting obeisance to the mushroom world. Possibly his learned editors, in mak-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ing their selections, rejected some eloquent paean to the fungi, considering</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the mere choice of such an outlandish theme sure evidence of a weak mind</p>

    <p class="calibre1">wrestling with an access of lunacy.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">On those rare occasions when the great English poets deign to pay serious</p>

    <p class="calibre1">attention to mushrooms, they habitually link these lovely creatures with death</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and decay. Keats refers to the 'cold mushrooms' in <i class="calibre4">Endymion,</i> and how</p>

    <p class="calibre1">deathly cold he makes them sound! Browning in <i class="calibre4">Paracelsus</i> strikes the same</p>

    <p class="calibre1">distressing mortuary note:</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">. . . as in the autumn woods</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Where tall trees used to flourish, from their roots</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Springs up a fungous brood sickly and pale, Chill</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushrooms coloured like a corpse's cheek.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">Tennyson in <i class="calibre4">Gareth andLynette</i> is as unpleasant about mushrooms as so decorous</p>

    <p class="calibre1">a poet knows how to be. The beautiful Lynette believes that Sir Gareth, the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">knight assigned to champion her cause, is a mere kitchen scullion, and she</p>

    <p class="calibre1">vents her contempt for him:</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">. .. She thereat, as one That</p>

    <p class="calibre1">smells a foul-flesh'd agaric in the holt, And deems</p>

    <p class="calibre1">it carrion of some woodland thing, Or shrew or</p>

    <p class="calibre1">weasel, nipt her slender nose With petulant thumb</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and finger, shrilling, 'Hence!'</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">'agaric' meaning a gilled mushroom. How clear in this recurring image of the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">famous poets is the echo of that folk detestation which the herbalists first re-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">corded ! Keats and Browning and Tennyson may have recalled Edmund Spen-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ser's lines, when in <i class="calibre4">The Shepheardes Calendar,</i> to heighten the sense of winter's</p>

    <p class="calibre1">gloom, he forces mushrooms to grow, contrary to nature, in cold dark Decem-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ber. Of course living fungi can sometimes be found in mid-winter but no</p>

    <p class="calibre1">observant person would think of associating the whole rich panoply of the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushroom world with the dying year. Spenser is contrasting the winter scene</p>

    <p class="calibre1">with summer:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Where I was wont to seeke the honey Bee</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Working her formall rowmes in Wexen frame:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The grieslie Todestool growne there mought I see</p>

    <p class="calibre1">And loathed Paddocks lording on the same. And</p>

    <p class="calibre1">where the chaunting birds luld me asleepe, The</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ghastlie Owle her grievous ynne doth keepe.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">If Spenser is fantastical, just listen to Shelley. In a strange and disturbing poem</p>

    <p class="calibre1">entitled 'The Sensitive Plant', wherein he, exactly like Spenser, contrasts the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">beauty of a summer garden with its desolate winter state, he also does violence</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to nature by associating early winter with the growth of loathed weeds and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">fungi. England's poets of the romantic period have long been praised for their</p>

    <p class="calibre1">close attention to nature, but in the light of these stanzas of Shelley's, one is</p>

    <p class="calibre1">tempted to ask how far their observations went. Did they merely know more</p>

    <p class="calibre1">than their predecessors? However that may be, Shelley in this poem was so</p>

    <p class="calibre1">successful in inspiring disgust that his widow in 1839 took it upon herself to</p>

    <p class="calibre1">suppress one of the stanzas, which we print below in italics, and it was not</p>

    <p class="calibre1">restored to the canon of his works for almost a century. That long-suppressed</p>

    <p class="calibre1">stanza exhales the triple distillate of the Englishman's loathing for toadstools:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">it is the supreme literary expression of this violent Anglo-Saxon prejudice.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Ariel, who at other times had caught in flight the skylark's ecstasy and divined</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the secret of the wild West Wind and breathed the magic spirit of Night,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">here chooses to plumb the abysses of physical revulsion, and in the very climax</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of his frenzy, the imagination of this Englishman calls forth rotting mush-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">rooms! Yes, and rotting mushrooms make him think of rotting human flesh!</p>

    <p class="calibre1">How bizarre for a Russian is this association of ideas that is forever recurring</p>

    <p class="calibre1">in the English poets!</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Between the time of the wind and the snow,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">All loathliest weeds began to grow,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Like the water-snake's belly and the toad's back.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">And thistles, and nettles, and darnels rank, And</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the dock, and henbane, and hemlock dank,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Stretch'd out its long and hollow shank, And</p>

    <p class="calibre1">stifled the air till the dead wind stank.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">And plants, at whose name the verse feels loath,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Prickly, and pulpous, and blistering, and blue,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Livid, and starred with a lurid dew.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">And agarics and fungi, with mildew and mould,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Started like mist from the wet ground cold; Pale,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">fleshy, as if the decaying dead With a spirit of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">growth had been animated!</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Their moss rotted off them, flake by flake, Till the</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">thick stalk stuck like a murderer s stake, Where rags</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">of loose flesh yet tremble on high, Inspecting the</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">winds</b> that wander by.</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1">Spawn, weeds, and filth, a leprous scum,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Made the running rivulet thick and dumb,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">And at its outlet, flags huge as stakes</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Dammed it up with roots knotted like watersnakes</p>

    <p class="calibre1">And hour by hour, when the air was still, The</p>

    <p class="calibre1">vapours arose, which have strength to kill: -At morn</p>

    <p class="calibre1">they were seen, at noon they were felt, At night they</p>

    <p class="calibre1">were darkness no star could melt.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">Emily Dickinson, though dead, has become a major poet of our times, having</p>

    <p class="calibre1">emerged like a nova in our literary sky long after she herself had sunk back into</p>

    <p class="calibre1">darkness. Her idiom has caught the fancy of the modern world, but did she do</p>

    <p class="calibre1">more than clothe old emotions in a new dress ? Among her poems is one about</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, written around 1874 and first published in 1891. It consists of five</p>

    <p class="calibre1">quatrains, of which the last distils the essence of the whole. Listen to those con-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">cluding lines, and you will hear only the old, the benighted theme:</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">Had nature any outcast face,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Could she a son contemn, Had</p>

    <p class="calibre1">nature an Iscariot, That</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushroom - it is him.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">For 'Iscariot' there is a variant that reads 'Apostate'.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">1 he mere thought of fungi seems enough to arouse loathing in an Englishman's</p>

    <p class="calibre1">breast. This revulsion is so dependable that when a novelist seeks to invoke</p>

    <p class="calibre1">horror, he need only drag in the toadstools. By this device A. Conan Doyle</p>

    <p class="calibre1">launches the story of <i class="calibre4">Sir Nigel,</i> on the eve of the Black Death, in October of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the year 1348:</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">. . . the rain had ceased at last, and a sickly autumn sun shone upon the land which was</p>

    <p class="calibre1">soaked and sodden with water. Wet and rotten leaves reeked and festered under the foul</p>

    <p class="calibre1">haze which rose from the woods. The fields were spotted with monstrous fungi of a</p>

    <p class="calibre1">size and color never matched before - scarlet and mauve and liver and black. It was as</p>

    <p class="calibre1">though the sick earth had burst into foul pustules; mildew and lichen mottled the walls,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and with that filthy crop, Death sprang also from the water-soaked earth.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">How different would be the description of such a scene by a Russian, who</p>

    <p class="calibre1">loves his moist Mother Earth, the autumn haze, the 'mushroom-rain', the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">humus rotting in the woods, and above all a splendid crop of monstrous</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushrooms! The Russian reader would put imperious questions to Conan</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Doyle. Would he please describe those mushrooms more satisfactorily. Were</p>

    <p class="calibre1">there four kinds each of a single color, or were all the specimens exhibiting</p>

    <p class="calibre1">all four colors? Precisely what species are we dealing with? Were not most</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of them edible or even delectable ? Why did not the English countryfolk turn</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to and gather and preserve them, by drying or pickling, to fortify their larder</p>

    <p class="calibre1">for the winter, the better to stand off any perils that the season might bring? . . .</p>

    <p class="calibre1">'Foul pustules', forsooth!</p>

    <p class="calibre1">In the whole rich world of English literature, I have happened on only two</p>

    <p class="calibre1">references to mushrooms that express an affection for the 'earthie excrescences'</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of the unfriendly herbalist, the 'corpse's cheek' of the poet. The writers of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">these lines were never famous and are now almost forgotten. The first was</p>

    <p class="calibre1">William Parkes, the author of one little book, <i class="calibre4">The Curtaine-Draiver of the</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">World,</i> published in 1612 in London. His reference to mushrooms is slight,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">but who that loves them will ever forget this vignette, truly observed, of the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushrooms clustered around the trunk of a cedar tree:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">. . . that Caedar . . .</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Under whose girdle, nay beneath whose knee,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The little Mesrumes louingly agree, [p. 20]</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The second was a cobbler named James Woodhouse who in 1787 penned</p>

    <p class="calibre1">an autumnal ode, to be found in a volume entitled <i class="calibre4">Norbury Park,</i> in which</p>

    <p class="calibre1">he first described the common field mushrooms which</p>

    <p class="calibre1">proudly spread their bonnets blythe, With</p>

    <p class="calibre1">coverings form'd of silk and snow And lin'd</p>

    <p class="calibre1">with brightening pink below.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">He then goes on to the 'toadstools', in whose forms and hues this Englishman</p>

    <p class="calibre1">concedes that he finds 'some solace'. Their</p>

    <p class="calibre1">tapering stems, robust, or light, Like</p>

    <p class="calibre1">columns catch the searching sight; Like fair</p>

    <p class="calibre1">umbrellas, furl'd, or spread, Display their many-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">colour'd head; Grey, purple, yellow, white, or</p>

    <p class="calibre1">brown, Shap'd like War's shield, or Prelate's</p>

    <p class="calibre1">crown —</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Like Freedom's cap, or Friar's cowl, Or</p>

    <p class="calibre1">China's bright inverted bowl -And</p>

    <p class="calibre1">while their broadening disks unfold Gay</p>

    <p class="calibre1">silvery gills, or nets of gold, Beneath</p>

    <p class="calibre1">their shady, curtain'd cove, Perform all</p>

    <p class="calibre1">offices of love.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">Whatever their failings as poetry, these verses reveal an independent mind,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">an observant eye, and a sympathetic heart.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">It is said that there are counties in England, notably in the Midlands, where</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the rhodopaxillus nudus is regularly gathered and offered in the market-places</p>

    <p class="calibre1">under the lovely name of blewits or blue-caps. The country-folk concerned</p>

    <p class="calibre1">with this humble harvest must possess some knowledge of wild mushrooms</p>

    <p class="calibre1">handed down from long ago. They might see the humor, invisible to most</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of their compatriots, in the following episode as told to me by Eric Whittle, an</p>

    <p class="calibre1">understanding English friend: "One day one of our lady audit assistants came</p>

    <p class="calibre1">in with a bag of what I identified afterwards as ceps, which she had bought</p>

    <p class="calibre1">from a hawker. She observed that they were unusual mushrooms but the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">hawker had said they were edible. After a discussion amongst my colleagues</p>

    <p class="calibre1">they were thrown into the dustbin. For my part I was a new member of the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Staff and my opinion was not asked." (The French <i class="calibre4">cepe</i> is often called in English</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the 'edible boletus', a heavy and unappetizing name, and a misleading one,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">implying as it does that all other boleti are inedible. My friend in his anecdote</p>

    <p class="calibre1">has wisely rendered <i class="calibre4">'cepe'</i> as 'cep', an example that our book follows.)</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Robert Graves has passed on to me another anecdote. During the recent war</p>

    <p class="calibre1">against Germany a Soho restaurateur called Bozzini went gathering ceps in</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Epping Forest near a secret site of the War Office. When charged with spying</p>

    <p class="calibre1">he said, "I'm an innocent mushroom collector." "Show me the mushrooms!",</p>

    <p class="calibre1">replied the policeman. Bozzini produced a suitcase full. "That proves you're</p>

    <p class="calibre1">a spy," said the constable. "Them's toadstools!"</p>

    <p class="calibre1">In 1943, when England was beset by mortal enemies, John Ramsbottom, the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">English mycologist, tried to augment and diversify the spare menu of his</p>

    <p class="calibre1">countrymen by a series of sensible lectures on the edibility of many wild fungi.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">EDIBLE TOADSTOOLS was the caption used by the great <i class="calibre4">Times</i> on September 29,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">1943, in reporting one of these talks. Could a more uninviting headline be</p>

    <p class="calibre1">devised; Things that are merely edible may be scarcely palatable, and toadstools</p>

    <p class="calibre1">by the innermost meaning of the word are unfit for the table. Had a Russian</p>

    <p class="calibre1">been charged with editing that news item, he would have enticed his readers</p>

    <p class="calibre1">with some such headline as WILD MUSHROOMS IN FINE COOKERY.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-58_2.jpg" /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">For almost four centuries the Russians and the English-speaking world have</p>

    <p class="calibre1">been eyeing each other, and at one point or another, on one level or another,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">intermingling. Yet among all the many commentaries on Russia published</p>

    <p class="calibre1">in the course of that long association, I know of only four that draw attention</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to the Russian passion for mushrooms. The earliest was by an English traveler,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">word-list of Richard James,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">1619, citing five kinds of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushrooms without English</p>

    <p class="calibre1">equivalents:</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ryzhik, guba, gruzd',</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">volonitsa, grib</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1">Bodleian, ms. James 43*</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Richard James, who in 1619, while visiting Muscovy, composed an extensive</p>

    <p class="calibre1">glossary of the Russian language, representing the Russian sounds by a system</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of transliteration of his own devising. He translated all of the Russian words</p>

    <p class="calibre1">into English, but when he came to the various kinds of mushrooms, he had</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to admit defeat: he lists five words and gives no translation! His glossary has</p>

    <p class="calibre1">never been published in full: the manuscript lies in the Bodleian Library.<br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">From 1660 to 1669 the Tsar Alexei maintained at his court an English phy-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">sician, Samuel Collins, whose valuable little book, <i class="calibre4">The Present State of Russia,</i> ap-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">peared in London anonymously in 1671. The author, unfortunately, died before</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the manuscript was completed, and the concluding chapter, entirely devoted</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to Russian mushrooms, appears to have suffered peculiarly from the ministra-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">tions of an unhappy literary executor. The text of this chapter is a mixture of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">scientific pretensions and fancy, and the illustrations are quaint aberrations.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Of a different order are the observations of an English clergyman, William</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Coxe, who embarked on a tour of Eastern Europe in 1773 and who in 1784</p>

    <p class="calibre1">brought out in three volumes his <i class="calibre4">Travels into Poland, Russia, Sweden and Denmark.</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1">He was an honest, laborious, and careful observer, whose pedestrian mentality</p>

    <p class="calibre1">saved him from tincturing his observations with fancy. In the opening chapter</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of Book IV he describes the condition of the Russian peasants as he saw them.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">He brings in the mushrooms, and both for this reason and because the whole</p>

    <p class="calibre1">tenor of his favorable comments about the muzhiks runs counter to the pre-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">conceptions of the West on this subject,! shall quote the passage with its context:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The peasants are well clothed, comfortably lodged, and seem to enjoy plenty of whole-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">some food. Their rye-bread, whose blackness at first disgusts the eye, and whose sourness</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the taste of a delicate traveller, agrees very well with the appetite; as I became reconciled</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to it from use, I found it at all times no unpleasant morsel, and, when seasoned with hunger,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">it was quite delicious: they render this bread more palatable by stuffing it with onions</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and groats, carrots or green corn, and seasoning it with sweet oil. The other articles of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">their food I have enumerated on a former occasion; in this place I shall only observe that</p>

    <p class="calibre1">mushrooms are so exceedingly common in these regions, as to form a very essential part</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of their provisions. I seldom enter a cottage without seeing great abundance of them, and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">in passing through the markets, I was often astonished at the prodigious quantity exposed</p>

    <p class="calibre1">for sale: thek variety was no less remarkable than their number; they were of many</p>

    <p class="calibre1">colours, amongst which I particularly noticed white, black, brown, yellow, green, and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">pink. The common drink of the peasants is quass, a fermented liquor, somewhat like sweet-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">wort, made by pouring warm water on rye or barley-meal; and deemed an excellent anti-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">scorbutic. They are extremely fond of whiskey, a spiritous liquor distilled from malt,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">which the poorest can occasionally command, and which their inclination often leads them</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to use to great excess.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The worthy Archdeacon Coxe seems not to have asked himself the reason</p>

    <p class="calibre1">for the abundance of mushrooms in the peasants' fare, whether it was owing</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to a greater abundance of fungi in the woods and fields of Russia, or simply</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to the habitual gathering of a normal crop. There is no reason to suppose that</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Russia produces more mushrooms than the United States or England.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Almost forty years after Mr. Coxe published his <i class="calibre4">Travels,</i> another English</p>

    <p class="calibre1">physician, Dr. Robert Lyall, brought out in 1823 a volume entitled <i class="calibre4">The Char-</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">acter of the Russians,</i> in which he dwelt at length on the Russians' addiction</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to mushrooms. He even undertook to record the common names used by</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the Russians and to identify them.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The knowledge of edible mushrooms [said Dr. Lyall], like a tradition, has been handed</p>

    <p class="calibre1">down, in Russia, from parent to child, through a series of ages; and the discrimination of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">these, from the hurtful or poisonous mushrooms, is learned by practice, in the years of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">infancy and youth... Indeed [he goes on], mushroom-gathering or hunting forms a great</p>

    <p class="calibre1">part of the occupation of the Russian peasants, boys and girls, as well as of the women at</p>

    <p class="calibre1">times, and is an amusement, in the country, of the nobility, males and females, old and</p>

    <p class="calibre1">young, who make short excursions to the woods in tbe neighborhood of their estates,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and spend a few hours in selecting one of the greatest delicacies of the epicures.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">With a rare perception of the realities of Muscovite life, Dr. Lyall continued:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Besides tbe enormous quantities of mushrooms which are brought fresh to market</p>

    <p class="calibre1">during the summer months, and which are immediately bought up, the better sorts by</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the nobility, the inferior kinds by the lower classes and the peasantry, a great abundance</p>

    <p class="calibre1">is preserved by the peasants in the country, who, after retaining a quantity sufficient for</p>

    <p class="calibre1">their own consumption, bring the surplus to town. They are brought throughout the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">whole year, in a dried state on strings, in cart-loads, and sold in all the provision markets,...</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and in all the small grocery-shops in the city. Sometimes even salted and pickled mushrooms</p>

    <p class="calibre1">may be bought.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">After a courageous effort to identify the various kinds of mushrooms, Dr.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Lyall discusses mushroom cookery:</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Mushrooms are eaten fried, boiled or pickled, while their season endures, by all</p>

    <p class="calibre1">classes. . . . They are fried on hot ashes, or in a frying-pan; they are boiled alone; they</p>

    <p class="calibre1">are boiled with <i class="calibre4">shchi</i> or cabbage soup; they are roasted with butter alone, or oftener with</p>

    <p class="calibre1">butter and <i class="calibre4">smetana</i> or sour cream. They also enter into the composition of some puddings</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and pies. The latter are generally eaten with soup or with <i class="calibre4">shchi.</i> Mushrooms are often</p>

    <p class="calibre1">served up with beef-steak, or roast beef sliced, either alone or mixed with potatoes, carrots,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">turnips, cabbage, asparagus, &amp;c., and sauce. They are excellent when prepared with cutlets</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and rich sauce, duly seasoned.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Transfixed with apprehension, the Western world seems today in a horrid</p>

    <p class="calibre1">trance, stop-watch in hand, as it gazes on Russia. It is wholesome to read the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">many fine books about Russia that were written in less anxious times, when</p>

    <p class="calibre1">authors and readers were relaxed, and when there were opportunities for deli-</p>

    <p class="calibre1">berate observation.</p>
