  <section>
    <p><span class="initial">T</span>HERE is no doubt about it: from, earliest times the English have had little use for mushrooms. The Crete Herball of 1526, a translation from the French, voiced the hostility of both peoples:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Fungi ben mussherons&hellip; There be two maners of them; one maner is deedly and sleeth them that eateth of them and be called tode stooles, and the other dooth not. They that be not deedly haue a grosse gleymy [slimy] moysture that is dysobedyent to nature and dygestyon, and be peryllous and dredfull to eate &amp; therefore it is good to eschew them.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the 16th century scientific thought had hardly begun to shake itself loose from folk-beliefs of unfathomed antiquity, and compilations such as The Crete Herball are a treasury of such beliefs. The printing press, fresh on the scene, captured and preserved for us the common content of men&rsquo;s minds at that moment in history when the Western World was beginning its slide into the modern era of big changes. And in the case of mushrooms, let us here salute a singular example of the tenacity with which even a great people sometimes clings to its primitive notions. For that naive division of the mushrooms between the &lsquo;two maners of them&rsquo;, the one deadly and the other not, and even these
    latter to be avoided &mdash; that elemental antipathy, captured for us in the text
    of the first comprehensive English herbal, has carried on with undiminished
    vigor through four centuries more, down to the present day. Learned mycologists write treatises and preach an enlightened gospel, but what do all their
    knowledge and all their cautious advice weigh? Small cliques of amateurs
    exist, but the public is not stirred. In a recent elaborate American work on
    mushrooms the author<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp2-fn1" id="cp2-r1">[1]</a></sup> brings himself to write a chapter on &lsquo;mycophagy&rsquo;, but confesses that he himself almost never lets mushrooms enter his mouth! Not thus does one inspire appetite in others. The repugnance for &lsquo;toadstools&rsquo; is sometimes an aggressive thing. I have seen the English governess, her charges
    in tow, advance on the enemy (a lovely and innocent russula, as it happened),
    kick it over, and with shudder and grimace crush it with the heel of her big,
    low-heeled shoe; turning then to the children, she shepherded them away
    from the unclean thing. Thus by an unspoken lesson this creature unwittingly
    seared their young minds with the branding iron of an ancient curse. Where
    she and her tribe see, in the words of the herbalist, a slimy toadstool, a Russian
    beholds &lsquo;the fat of the earth&rsquo;.</p>

    <p>As the 16th century drew to a close, in 1597, John Gerarde brought out his
    famous <i>Herball or General! Historie of Plantes,</i> an immense and delightful book.
    What he says of mushrooms may differ little in substance from <i>The Crete Herball</i>, but his opulent manner of expressing the same thing deserves the accolade of the reader&rsquo;s attention. The Englishman is venturesome in most things save food, and never before Gerarde nor since has that peculiar dietary conservatism of the race received more elegant and curious endorsement:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Many wantons that dwell neere the sea, and haue fish at will, are for change of diet to
      feede vpon the birds of the mountaines; and such as dwell vpon the hils or champion
      grounds, do long after sea-fish; many that haue plenty of both, doe hunger after the
      earthie excrescences, called mushrums; whereof some are very venemous and full of
      poison; others not so noisome; and neither of them very wholesome meate &hellip;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Master Gerarde then proceeds to describe one kind that is not bad and straight-way a dozen that he condemns, saying about a certain species that grows in
    &ldquo;mossie and shadowie woods&rdquo; that he does &ldquo;the more briefly passe them ouer,
    not purposing to vse many words about such fruitlesse matters&rdquo;. Finally he
    comes to his sweeping and memorable conclusions:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Galen amrmeth that they are all very colde and moist, and therefore do approoch vnto a
        venemous and murthering facultie; and ingender a clammie, pituitous, and colde nutriment
        if they be eaten.</p>
      <p>To conclude, fewe of them are good to be eaten; and most of them do suffocate and
        strangle the eater. Therefore I giue my simple aduice vnto those that loue such a strange
        and newefangled meates, to beware of licking honie among thornes, least the sweetenes
        of the one do not countervaile the sharpnes and pricking of the other.</p>
      <span class="pull-right">[pp. 1384-6 of first edition]</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A few years after Gerarde, in 1609, Sir Michael Scott said his say about mushrooms in <i>The Philosophers banquet</i>, and here and now we give to his words new wings:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&hellip; Sow-beard<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp2-fn2" id="cp2-r2">[2]</a></sup> or Mushrome, according to Rasis [the Arabian physician] is cold and
        grosse, and being taken raw ingenders flegme, and the chollike, and windinesse in the
        guts; neither is it to be eaten but with hot sauce or meate, but the red are not to be eaten
        at all. The Todestoole is much worse then the Mushrome: for it hath choaked and killed
        many that haue taken it, and the best that it doth, is to breed flegme in the body in
        aboundance &hellip; [Verso of folio 36, wrongly numbered 33]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>These famous herbalists whom I have quoted were leaning on the authority
    of Dioscorides, Galen, and Rhazes, but they elaborated richly on their sources,
    going far beyond the Greek and Arabic writers in maligning the mushroom
    tribe, and invoking the oracles only to clothe with their authority the loathing of
    the English, which they undertook to express in their full-bodied prose.</p>

    <p>Half a century after Gerarde it was still possible for a well-born and educated
    Englishman to reach man&rsquo;s estate without having heard of truffles. John Evelyn
    at the age of 24 made their acquaintance in France. On September 28, 1644,
    he found himself in Vienne, a day&rsquo;s journey by river from Lyons, and there,
    as he says in his diary, he &ldquo;supped and lay, having amongst other dainties, a
    dish of truffles, which is a certain earth-nut, found out by a hog trained to it,
    and for which those animals are sold at a great price. <i>It is in truth an incomparable meat.&rdquo;</i> (The emphasis is mine.)</p>

    <p>The Englishman in Evelyn was being diluted by travel. His hospitality to
    strange and newfangled meats found no echo in his countryman Jeremy Taylor,
    who in 1650-1, in his <i>Holy Living and Dying,</i> strikes the less liberal note:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Fly from all occasions, temptations, loosenesses of company, balls and revellings,
        indecent mixtures of wanton dancings, idle talk, private society with strange women,
        starings upon a beauteous face, the company of women that are singers, amorous gestures,
        garish and wanton dresses, feasts and liberty, banquets and perfumes, wine and strong
        drinks, which are made to persecute chastity; some of these being the very prologues to
        lust, and the most innocent of them being like condited [seasoned] and pickled mushrooms,
        which, if carefully corrected and seldom tasted, may be harmless, but can never do good.
        [Chap. 2, &lsquo;On Christian Sobriety&rsquo;, Sec. in, &lsquo;Remedies against Uncleanness&rsquo;]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It was Jeremy Taylor&rsquo;s privilege to believe in the mortification of the flesh, but why did he vent his spleen on the humble mushroom? I hope to show on a later page that he and the herbalists were voicing, unbeknownst to themselves, a pre-Christian tabu shared by all the peoples who dwell on the shores of the North Sea. The passage about the condited and pickled mushrooms follows hard on another that perhaps my readers will thank me for recalling.
   The stern author is listing his remedies against &lsquo;uncleanness&rsquo;, and here is what he recommends about food in general:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>A spare diet, and a thin coarse table, seldom refreshment, frequent fasts, not violent,
          and interrupted with returns to ordinary feeding, but constantly little, unpleasant, of
          wholesome but sparing nourishment: for by such cutting off the provisions of victual,
          we shall weaken the strengths of our enemy.</p>
      </blockquote> 


    <p>Is it uncharitable to venture the opinion that this exhortation to consume
    unpleasant food, from Jeremy Taylor&rsquo;s day even unto now, has been more
    honour&rsquo;d by his countrymen in the observance than the breach?</p>

    <p>Apparently the Stuarts on recovering the throne of England brought back
    with them from across the Channel an appetite for the mushroom world.
    How else shall we explain that before the end of the century the Englishman
    was commonly referring to the good earthy &lsquo;trubs&rsquo;? A little later both truffles
    and morels began to figure in the cookbooks. For example, Patrick Lamb,
    who was for &ldquo;near fifty years&rdquo; master-cook to Charles II, James II, William and
    Mary, and Queen Anne, in his <i>Royal Cookery or the Compleat Court-Cook</i>
    (London, 1726) includes in his menus mushrooms (which he fails to identify),
    morels, and truffles. In the extracts filling five volumes that have been published
    of Parson James Woodforde&rsquo;s prodigious diary, he refers repeatedly to pickled
    mushrooms, to truffles, to morels. Toward the end of the i8th century they
    had become a regular feature of this country clergyman&rsquo;s fare, brought to
    his door by the folk who had gathered them. Gilbert White in his <i>Observations on Vegetables</i> reports that a truffle-hunter had called on him &ldquo;having in his
    pocket several large truffles&rdquo; found in the neighborhood of Selborne; the man
    was offering them to him at half a crown a pound. White speaks casually
    of the dogs that the truffle-hunter was using to smell out the truffles. It is clear
    that truffle hunting was no novelty for him. One might have expected to
    find the gentlemen of England in that urbane century relishing the table deli-
    cacies familiar to the French and Italians; and since they were also steeped in
    the classics, they must have known of the addiction of the epicures of ancient
    Rome to mushrooms. But it is startling now to discover from the casual
    observations of two rural clergymen that the English rustics in their time
    were gathering morels and truffles for the market. In the whole of the
    English-speaking world today, does there survive a single truffle-hunter e
    (Truffles grow in America also, but few pay attention to them, rarely even
    the mycologists. They are one of the New World's still untapped resources.)
    That strange false dawn of mycophagy which marked England's i8th century
    even attained expression in art when Thomas Gainsborough painted his <i>Mushroom Girl,</i> a sample of bucolic sentimentality typical of its time and milieu.
    Is not this the only occasion in the history of English art when a painter of the
    first rank has acknowledged the existence of the fungal world? And in this case
    the basket filled with field mushrooms is only a detail in the composition,
    an excuse for a title. There exists in a private collection a second work by
    Gainsborough with the same title, a wholly different composition, showing a
    child, close up, as she reaches out for mushrooms growing in a field.</p>

    <p>Having once taken hold, why did this Arcadian pursuit, so noble in its simplicity, die out? Morels and truffles added variety to the Englishman's fare, but
    they were destined to vanish from his table in the course of the strange decay
    that overcame the English cuisine in the glorious Victorian era. In 1847 the
    mycologist Badham was saying of mushrooms that &ldquo;England is the only country
    in Europe where this important and savoury food is, from ignorance or prejudice, left to perish ungathered.&rdquo;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp2-fn3" id="cp2-r3">[3]</a></sup> Half a century later,in 1891, another mycologist
    who bore the arresting name of Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, in a delightful treatise
    on the edible fungi pointed out that &ldquo;in the time of our grandfathers it was
    almost universally believed that our islands produced but one kind of fungus
    which was edible.&rdquo;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp2-fn4" id="cp2-r4">[4]</a></sup> His words implied a growth in enlightenment in his own
    lifetime that few other observers have detected either then or since his day.
    Apart from occasional remarks in the writings of mycologists, the English
    have paid little attention to their blindspot concerning mushrooms. So far as
    I know, even among the mycologists only one has done justice to the subject,
    inveighing against his countrymen's prejudice &mdash; William Delisle Hay, who published <i>An Elementary Text-book of British Fungi</i> in London in 1887. His voice
    crying in the solitudes deserves to be recalled. Speaking of the fungi near the
    beginning of his book, he says:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
    <p>Among this vast family of plants. . . there is but one kind that Englishmen con-
    descend to regard with favour. All the rest are lumped together in one sweeping con-
    demnation. They are looked upon as vegetable vermin, only made to be destroyed. No
    eye can see their beauties; their office is unknown; their varieties are not regarded; they are
    hardly allowed a place among nature's lawful children, but are considered something
    abnormal, worthless, and inexplicable. By precept and example children are taught from
    earliest infancy to despise, loathe, and avoid all kinds of 'toadstools'. The individual who
    desires to engage in the study of them must boldly face a good deal of scorn. He is
    laughed at for his strange taste among the better classes, and is actually regarded as a sort
    of idiot among the lower orders. No fad or hobby is esteemed so contemptible as that of
    'fungus-hunter' or 'toadstool-eater'.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This popular sentiment, which we may coin the word 'fungophobia' to express, is very</p>

    <p>curious. If it were human - that is, universal - one would be inclined to set it down as an</p>

    <p>instinct, and to reverence it accordingly. But it is not human - it is merely British. It is so</p>

    <p>deep and intense a prejudice that it amounts to a national superstition. Fungophobia is</p>

    <p>merely a form of ignorance, of course; but its power over the British mind is so immense,</p>

    <p>that the mycologist, anxious to impart the knowledge he has gleaned to others, often meets</p>

    <p>with scarcely credence or respect. The superstition strikes deep. He who would write or</p>

    <p>lecture about Fungi can scarce find readers or hearers. The English scientist investigates</p>

    <p>every domain of nature, but leaves this one coldly alone. The English medical man</p>

    <p>disdains to inquire into the chemical constitution of Fungi, and is indifferent to and</p>

    <p>unknowing of their relations in regard to medicine, toxicology, diet, or hygiene. It is</p>

    <p>surely high time that English intelligence should rise superior to this peculiar phase of</p>

    <p>ignorance. . . .</p>

    <p>It is a striking instance of the confused popular notions of Fungi in England, that hardly</p>

    <p>any species have or ever had colloquial English names. They are all 'toadstools', and</p>

    <p>therefore are thought unworthy of individual baptism. Can anything more fully de-</p>

    <p>monstrate the existence of that deep-rooted prejudice called here 'fungophobia'; . . . In</p>

    <p>the countries of the Continent the greater number of species have each their particular</p>

    <p>local names. Even the Redskin of America and the Maori of New Zealand have specific</p>

    <p>names for their common Fungi. Only we prejudiced Britons have none.</p>

    <p>More than six decades have passed since the above lines were penned, and</p>

    <p>though the English-speaking world has produced numbers of good mycologists</p>

    <p>since then, the substance of the indictment is as true today as when William</p>

    <p>Delisle Hay raised his voice in protest.</p>

    <p>Hay could have cited Charles Darwin to illustrate his point. This observant</p>

    <p>and knowledgeable scientist, in that supreme book of travel, his diary of the</p>

    <p>voyage of H. M. S. BEAGLE, remarked in the entry for June i, 1834, that the</p>

    <p>natives of Tierra del Fuego relied on a certain arboreal fungus (a species of the</p>

    <p>genus cyttaria) for an important part of their diet; and then, almost as though</p>

    <p>to supply me with a singularly happy illustration for my argument, our learned</p>

    <p>young man showed the limitations of his learning. "At the present time," said</p>

    <p>Charles Darwin in 1834, "I think Tierra del Fuego is the only country in the</p>

    <p>world where a cryptogamic plant [i.e., a fungus] affords a staple article of</p>

    <p>food." The young Charles Darwin knew more about the Fuegians than about</p>

    <p>the northern Slavs and Catalans.</p>

    <p>As to mycophagy, Darwin revealed a strange lapse in knowledge that amount-</p>

    <p>ed to a failure of perception. In him the mycophobia of the English was a mild</p>

    <p>affliction, a recessive trait. Sometimes this racial infirmity erupts with terrifying</p>

    <p>ferocity. Let the reader consider the following quotation from Mrs. Gwen</p>

    <p>Raverat's <i>Period Piece,</i> a book of Victorian reminiscences published in 1953.</p>

    <p>Here we learn what mushroom gathering a 1'anglaise can sometimes mean, to</p>

    <p>what mad purpose the gentle art of mushroom knowing may be perverted:</p>

    <p>In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular THE</p>

    <p>STINKHORN, though in Latin it bears a grosser name [the phallus impudicus, of course].</p>

    <p>The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt</p>

    <p>Etty's great invention: armed with a basket, and a pointed stick, and wearing a special</p>

    <p>hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and</p>

    <p>there, her nostrils twitching, when she caught a whiff of her prey; then at last, with a</p>

    <p>deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her bas-</p>

    <p>ket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest</p>

    <p>secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; <i>because of the morals of the maids.</i></p>

    <p>[pp.135-6]</p>

    <p>Who was Aunt Etty ? She was Charles Darwin's daughter!</p>

    <p>In all the enchanted pages about England's rural life that W. H. Hudson</p>

    <p>gave to the world around the turn of the present century, there are scarcely</p>

    <p>a half dozen references to mushrooms. Once he conveys in a sentence or two</p>

    <p>the magic spell cast on the perceptive beholder when he first discovers a 'fairy-</p>

    <p>ring' - those meadow mushrooms that ofttimes grow in perfect circles, the</p>

    <p>circles expanding by tiny stages each year through decades and even perhaps</p>

    <p>centuries. Elsewhere Hudson speaks of his having gathered mushrooms, but</p>

    <p>from the colorless reference it seems clear that he was speaking only of the</p>

    <p>ordinary field mushroom. Thus even Hudson, with ah1 his sensibility to nature,</p>

    <p>never opened his eyes to the mushroom world.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp2-fn5" id="cp2-r5">[5]</a></sup></p>

    <p>Thoreau did somewhat better. His allusions in <i>Walden</i> are trifling, but in his</p>

    <p>superb <i>Journals</i> he speaks of the fungi time and again. In passages of luminous</p>

    <p>beauty he vibrates to their visual appeal: suddenly he is off with a theme like</p>

    <p>this: "The most interesting domes I behold are not those of Oriental temples and</p>

    <p>palaces, but of the toadstools." He ponders over and over again on the strangeness</p>

    <p>of these lowly organisms. He philosophizes, and with his teetotaler's bias not</p>

    <p>always happily: "The life of a wine-bibber is like that of a fungus..." In all that</p>

    <p>Thoreau says of the mushrooms, for a Russian something is lacking. He views</p>

    <p>the mushrooms as he contemplates the stars, without touching or smelling or</p>

    <p>tasting them. Not once does he convey to the reader a carnal sensation. Somehow</p>

    <p><br /></p>


    <p><br /></p>

    <p>we cannot picture Thoreau greedily stirring a stew of savory mushrooms over</p>

    <p>his stove in his hermitage at Walden; that man's saliva never runs. There is</p>

    <p>something of the eunuchoid aesthete about him. He is too pure to be fun.</p>

    <p>But a similar insensibility afflicts even those whose business it is to discuss</p>

    <p>culinary matters. As recently as 1943 an eminent American gourmet in a book</p>

    <p>about food declared that there were two schools when it came to preparing</p>

    <p>fresh mushrooms for the table - those who peeled them and those who didn't.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp2-fn6" id="cp2-r6">[6]</a></sup></p>

    <p>For the Russians, how irrelevant is this 'either-or' dichotomy as a key to the</p>

    <p>culinary possibilities of the multitudinous world of the mushrooms! It is as</p>

    <p>though a critic of music should say that when it comes to making music, there</p>

    <p>are two schools of performers - those who stand and those who sit. Whenever</p>

    <p>there is discussion of Russian cooking, it is easy, by a few discreet inquiries about</p>

    <p>mushrooms, to discover those who know whereof they speak.</p>

    <p>Ihe herbals of old served as botany books, medical books, and cookbooks;</p>

    <p>they were not composed as contributions to the <i>belles lettres.</i> It might be thought</p>

    <p>that in the flood-tide of English literature, the poets with their heightened</p>

    <p>insight would have shown themselves aware of the sensuous beauty of the</p>

    <p>mushroom world. Not at all. On this subject the English poets missed their</p>

    <p>chance to be emancipators. Chaucer and Milton ignore the mushrooms, and</p>

    <p>so I think does Wordsworth, the poet of nature and humble things. Thomas</p>

    <p>Gray seems to have overlooked those that adorned his country churchyards.</p>

    <p>Robert Burns brings them in, but only once, in his verses to William Creech,</p>

    <p>and they serve merely to turn a rime:</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>Now gawkies, tawpies, gowks, and fools. . .</p>

    <p>May sprout like simmer puddock stools;</p>

    <p>'puddock' meaning toads.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>Shakespere refers perfunctorily to mushrooms once, in <i>The Tempest,</i> and in</p>

    <p><i>Troilus and Cressida</i> a character dismisses another with 'Toadstool!' as an epithet.</p>

    <p>Indeed, for Shakespere the two words serve little use beyond swelling his</p>

    <p>already immense vocabulary count. Apparently 'toadstool' was an accepted</p>

    <p>term of abuse in the lyth century: William Penn in the hot flush of his then</p>

    <p>recent religious conversion denounced the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford as 'Thou</p>

    <p>poor mushroom!' - a form of address that a Russian would surely misconstrue</p>

    <p>as a term of endearment.</p>

    <p><br /></p>


    <p><br /></p>

    <p>In the 18th century the British continued to belabor the poor fungal tribe with</p>

    <p>a cold, unrelenting hate marvelous to see. Tobias Smollett in 1757 produced in</p>

    <p>Drury Lane an extravaganza called <i>The Reprisal; or, the Tars of Old England,</i> a</p>

    <p>feeble satire on patriotism and the conventional ideas about the French. The</p>

    <p>villain is the commanding officer of a French frigate, on whose ship the action</p>

    <p>is laid. He is a "musty, vain, French martinet", a ridiculous cad, and he carries</p>

    <p>the name of Monsieur le Marquis de Champignon!</p>

    <p>For this aspersion on mushrooms Smollett was to be repaid in kind, and</p>

    <p>with interest. He published his famous <i>Travels through France and Italy</i> in</p>

    <p>1766, a narrative memorable for its angry comments on everything that the</p>

    <p>irascible Scottish physician saw and experienced. The critics took him to task</p>

    <p>especially for his inability to perceive any artistic virtue in the Pantheon or the</p>

    <p>Medicean Venus. Two years later, almost as a riposte to Smollett's book, Lau-</p>

    <p>rence Sterne brought out his sensationally successful <i>Sentimental journey,</i> and</p>

    <p>there near the beginning he pays his compliments to Smelfungus, the pseudonym</p>

    <p>that he bestows on Smollett and that Smollett to his dying day never lived down.</p>

    <p>The name is a key to the Englishman's attitude toward mushrooms: knowing</p>

    <p>Smollett as we do and Sterne's feelings about him, we discover what fungi</p>

    <p>and their smell meant for them and for Sterne's popular following. The earthy</p>

    <p>smell of decaying leaves and compost heap, of dank mushrooms growing in</p>

    <p>rich clusters, the smell that the French call 1'odeur du terreau, is pleasing to all</p>

    <p>who love simple and genuine things. Moreover, the mushroom tribe in fact</p>

    <p>offers the widest range of smells, not just one and that one foul. Indeed, as</p>

    <p>connoisseurs know, each species breathes its individual olfactory signature.</p>

    <p>There was of course a phonetic echo of Smollett's name in Sterne's insulting</p>

    <p>epithet, the kind of punning suggestion that Sterne loved.</p>

    <p>Here, then, is salacious Sterne on Smollett:</p>

    <p>The learned <i>Smelfungus</i> travelled from Boulogne to Paris - from Paris to Rome - and</p>

    <p>so on-but he set out with the spleen and jaundice, and every object he pass'd by was</p>

    <p>discoloured or distorted -. He wrote an account of them, but 'twas nothing but the account</p>

    <p>of his miserable feelings.</p>

    <p>I met Smelfungus in the grand portico of the Pantheon - he was just coming out of it -</p>

    <p><i>'Tis nothing but a huge cock-pit,</i> said he - I wish you had said nothing worse of the Venus</p>

    <p>of Medicis, replied I - for in passing through Florence, I had heard he had fallen foul upon</p>

    <p>the goddess, and used her worse than a common strumpet, without the least provocation</p>

    <p>in nature.</p>

    <p>I popp'd upon Smelfungus again at Turin, in his return home; and a sad tale of</p>

    <p>sorrowful adventures had he to tell, "wherein he spoke of moving accidents by flood and</p>

    <p>field, and of the cannibals which each other eat: the Anthropophagi" - he had been flea'd</p>

    <p>alive, and bedeviled, and used worse than St. Bartholomew, at every stage he had come at --</p>

    <p>I'll tell it, cried Smelfungus, to the world. You had better tell it, said I, to your</p>

    <p>physician.</p>

    <p>In his next paragraph Sterne takes another traveler to task, some Croesus</p>

    <p>whom he dubs Mundungus, a word, now fallen into disuse, that meant 'offal',</p>

    <p>'refuse', 'filth'. A few years later, in the lySo's, Sterne's Smelfungus and Mun-</p>

    <p>dungus turn up again, in a satirical poem, <i>The Children of Thespis,</i> by 'Anthony</p>

    <p>Pasquin', the pen-name of a shady journalist named John Williams. He too</p>

    <p>vents psychopathic loathing on the inoffensive fungi:</p>

    <p>Thus scarceness gives value to dirt and mundungus,</p>

    <p>And dignifies that Nature meant as a fungus.</p>

    <p>But fungus and filth have their uses and buyers,</p>

    <p>Hence oceans of urine are purchas'd by dyers;</p>

    <p>And lawyers, who liv'd but to generate strife,</p>

    <p>May serve when they're dead for th'Anatomist's knife.</p>

    <p>Let not the squeamish reader shrink from the stench of Sterne's Smelfungus:</p>

    <p>it curls upward from the very viscera of the Englishman's mycophobia. Contrast</p>

    <p>that smell, if you please, with the Russian's scale of values. On August 22, 1851,</p>

    <p>Alexej Konstantinovich Tolstoy penned a letter<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp2-fn7" id="cp2-r7">[7]</a></sup> from the country to the young</p>

    <p>woman whom he later married and his subject was the odor of mushrooms:</p>

    <p>I have just returned from the forest where I went gathering mushrooms and found</p>

    <p>many. Once you and I discussed how odors evoke the memory of things forgotten for</p>

    <p>many a year. For me the smells of the forest possess this faculty more than any others,</p>

    <p>but perhaps this is only because I passed my whole childhood in the woods. Just now I</p>

    <p>smelled a <i>ryzhik,</i> and as in a flash of lightning I saw my whole childhood, in all its</p>

    <p>details, up to the age of seven. The vision came and was gone in a thousandth part of</p>

    <p>a second. Each kind of mushroom has its own odor, but always it brings back to us</p>

    <p>the past . ..</p>

    <p>The common English names for the wild plants are rich in poetry, and</p>

    <p>perhaps no English poet of standing has made use of a wider variety of such</p>

    <p>names than John Clare, the farm-laborer who passed most of his adult life</p>

    <p>within the confines of a lunatic asylum. Yet in the two volumes of poor Clare's</p>

    <p>published poems I have discovered only one casual reference to 'mushroom</p>

    <p>buttons'. True, most of his verses still lie unpublished, and we must not exclude</p>

    <p>the possibility that this observant and original rustic poet somewhere paid</p>

    <p><br /></p>


    <p><br /></p>

    <p>fitting obeisance to the mushroom world. Possibly his learned editors, in mak-</p>

    <p>ing their selections, rejected some eloquent paean to the fungi, considering</p>

    <p>the mere choice of such an outlandish theme sure evidence of a weak mind</p>

    <p>wrestling with an access of lunacy.</p>

    <p>On those rare occasions when the great English poets deign to pay serious</p>

    <p>attention to mushrooms, they habitually link these lovely creatures with death</p>

    <p>and decay. Keats refers to the 'cold mushrooms' in <i>Endymion,</i> and how</p>

    <p>deathly cold he makes them sound! Browning in <i>Paracelsus</i> strikes the same</p>

    <p>distressing mortuary note:</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>. . . as in the autumn woods</p>

    <p>Where tall trees used to flourish, from their roots</p>

    <p>Springs up a fungous brood sickly and pale, Chill</p>

    <p>mushrooms coloured like a corpse's cheek.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>Tennyson in <i>Gareth andLynette</i> is as unpleasant about mushrooms as so decorous</p>

    <p>a poet knows how to be. The beautiful Lynette believes that Sir Gareth, the</p>

    <p>knight assigned to champion her cause, is a mere kitchen scullion, and she</p>

    <p>vents her contempt for him:</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>. .. She thereat, as one That</p>

    <p>smells a foul-flesh'd agaric in the holt, And deems</p>

    <p>it carrion of some woodland thing, Or shrew or</p>

    <p>weasel, nipt her slender nose With petulant thumb</p>

    <p>and finger, shrilling, 'Hence!'</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>'agaric' meaning a gilled mushroom. How clear in this recurring image of the</p>

    <p>famous poets is the echo of that folk detestation which the herbalists first re-</p>

    <p>corded ! Keats and Browning and Tennyson may have recalled Edmund Spen-</p>

    <p>ser's lines, when in <i>The Shepheardes Calendar,</i> to heighten the sense of winter's</p>

    <p>gloom, he forces mushrooms to grow, contrary to nature, in cold dark Decem-</p>

    <p>ber. Of course living fungi can sometimes be found in mid-winter but no</p>

    <p>observant person would think of associating the whole rich panoply of the</p>

    <p>mushroom world with the dying year. Spenser is contrasting the winter scene</p>

    <p>with summer:</p>

    <p>Where I was wont to seeke the honey Bee</p>

    <p>Working her formall rowmes in Wexen frame:</p>

    <p>The grieslie Todestool growne there mought I see</p>

    <p>And loathed Paddocks lording on the same. And</p>

    <p>where the chaunting birds luld me asleepe, The</p>

    <p>ghastlie Owle her grievous ynne doth keepe.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>If Spenser is fantastical, just listen to Shelley. In a strange and disturbing poem</p>

    <p>entitled 'The Sensitive Plant', wherein he, exactly like Spenser, contrasts the</p>

    <p>beauty of a summer garden with its desolate winter state, he also does violence</p>

    <p>to nature by associating early winter with the growth of loathed weeds and</p>

    <p>fungi. England's poets of the romantic period have long been praised for their</p>

    <p>close attention to nature, but in the light of these stanzas of Shelley's, one is</p>

    <p>tempted to ask how far their observations went. Did they merely know more</p>

    <p>than their predecessors? However that may be, Shelley in this poem was so</p>

    <p>successful in inspiring disgust that his widow in 1839 took it upon herself to</p>

    <p>suppress one of the stanzas, which we print below in italics, and it was not</p>

    <p>restored to the canon of his works for almost a century. That long-suppressed</p>

    <p>stanza exhales the triple distillate of the Englishman's loathing for toadstools:</p>

    <p>it is the supreme literary expression of this violent Anglo-Saxon prejudice.</p>

    <p>Ariel, who at other times had caught in flight the skylark's ecstasy and divined</p>

    <p>the secret of the wild West Wind and breathed the magic spirit of Night,</p>

    <p>here chooses to plumb the abysses of physical revulsion, and in the very climax</p>

    <p>of his frenzy, the imagination of this Englishman calls forth rotting mush-</p>

    <p>rooms! Yes, and rotting mushrooms make him think of rotting human flesh!</p>

    <p>How bizarre for a Russian is this association of ideas that is forever recurring</p>

    <p>in the English poets!</p>

    <p>Between the time of the wind and the snow,</p>

    <p>All loathliest weeds began to grow,</p>

    <p>Whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck,</p>

    <p>Like the water-snake's belly and the toad's back.</p>

    <p>And thistles, and nettles, and darnels rank, And</p>

    <p>the dock, and henbane, and hemlock dank,</p>

    <p>Stretch'd out its long and hollow shank, And</p>

    <p>stifled the air till the dead wind stank.</p>

    <p>And plants, at whose name the verse feels loath,</p>

    <p>Filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth,</p>

    <p>Prickly, and pulpous, and blistering, and blue,</p>

    <p>Livid, and starred with a lurid dew.</p>

    <p>And agarics and fungi, with mildew and mould,</p>

    <p>Started like mist from the wet ground cold; Pale,</p>

    <p>fleshy, as if the decaying dead With a spirit of</p>

    <p>growth had been animated!</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p><i>Their moss rotted off them, flake by flake, Till the</i></p>

    <p><i>thick stalk stuck like a murderer s stake, Where rags</i></p>

    <p><i>of loose flesh yet tremble on high, Inspecting the</i></p>

    <p><i><b class="calibre5">winds</b> that wander by.</i></p>

    <p>Spawn, weeds, and filth, a leprous scum,</p>

    <p>Made the running rivulet thick and dumb,</p>

    <p>And at its outlet, flags huge as stakes</p>

    <p>Dammed it up with roots knotted like watersnakes</p>

    <p>And hour by hour, when the air was still, The</p>

    <p>vapours arose, which have strength to kill: -At morn</p>

    <p>they were seen, at noon they were felt, At night they</p>

    <p>were darkness no star could melt.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>Emily Dickinson, though dead, has become a major poet of our times, having</p>

    <p>emerged like a nova in our literary sky long after she herself had sunk back into</p>

    <p>darkness. Her idiom has caught the fancy of the modern world, but did she do</p>

    <p>more than clothe old emotions in a new dress ? Among her poems is one about</p>

    <p>mushrooms, written around 1874 and first published in 1891. It consists of five</p>

    <p>quatrains, of which the last distils the essence of the whole. Listen to those con-</p>

    <p>cluding lines, and you will hear only the old, the benighted theme:</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>Had nature any outcast face,</p>

    <p>Could she a son contemn, Had</p>

    <p>nature an Iscariot, That</p>

    <p>mushroom - it is him.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>For 'Iscariot' there is a variant that reads 'Apostate'.</p>

    <p>1 he mere thought of fungi seems enough to arouse loathing in an Englishman's</p>

    <p>breast. This revulsion is so dependable that when a novelist seeks to invoke</p>

    <p>horror, he need only drag in the toadstools. By this device A. Conan Doyle</p>

    <p>launches the story of <i>Sir Nigel,</i> on the eve of the Black Death, in October of</p>

    <p>the year 1348:</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>. . . the rain had ceased at last, and a sickly autumn sun shone upon the land which was</p>

    <p>soaked and sodden with water. Wet and rotten leaves reeked and festered under the foul</p>

    <p>haze which rose from the woods. The fields were spotted with monstrous fungi of a</p>

    <p>size and color never matched before - scarlet and mauve and liver and black. It was as</p>

    <p>though the sick earth had burst into foul pustules; mildew and lichen mottled the walls,</p>

    <p>and with that filthy crop, Death sprang also from the water-soaked earth.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>How different would be the description of such a scene by a Russian, who</p>

    <p>loves his moist Mother Earth, the autumn haze, the 'mushroom-rain', the</p>

    <p>humus rotting in the woods, and above all a splendid crop of monstrous</p>

    <p>mushrooms! The Russian reader would put imperious questions to Conan</p>

    <p>Doyle. Would he please describe those mushrooms more satisfactorily. Were</p>

    <p>there four kinds each of a single color, or were all the specimens exhibiting</p>

    <p>all four colors? Precisely what species are we dealing with? Were not most</p>

    <p>of them edible or even delectable ? Why did not the English countryfolk turn</p>

    <p>to and gather and preserve them, by drying or pickling, to fortify their larder</p>

    <p>for the winter, the better to stand off any perils that the season might bring? . . .</p>

    <p>'Foul pustules', forsooth!</p>

    <p>In the whole rich world of English literature, I have happened on only two</p>

    <p>references to mushrooms that express an affection for the 'earthie excrescences'</p>

    <p>of the unfriendly herbalist, the 'corpse's cheek' of the poet. The writers of</p>

    <p>these lines were never famous and are now almost forgotten. The first was</p>

    <p>William Parkes, the author of one little book, <i>The Curtaine-Draiver of the</i></p>

    <p><i>World,</i> published in 1612 in London. His reference to mushrooms is slight,</p>

    <p>but who that loves them will ever forget this vignette, truly observed, of the</p>

    <p>mushrooms clustered around the trunk of a cedar tree:</p>

    <p>. . . that Caedar . . .</p>

    <p>Under whose girdle, nay beneath whose knee,</p>

    <p>The little Mesrumes louingly agree, [p. 20]</p>

    <p>The second was a cobbler named James Woodhouse who in 1787 penned</p>

    <p>an autumnal ode, to be found in a volume entitled <i>Norbury Park,</i> in which</p>

    <p>he first described the common field mushrooms which</p>

    <p>proudly spread their bonnets blythe, With</p>

    <p>coverings form'd of silk and snow And lin'd</p>

    <p>with brightening pink below.</p>

    <p>He then goes on to the 'toadstools', in whose forms and hues this Englishman</p>

    <p>concedes that he finds 'some solace'. Their</p>

    <p>tapering stems, robust, or light, Like</p>

    <p>columns catch the searching sight; Like fair</p>

    <p>umbrellas, furl'd, or spread, Display their many-</p>

    <p>colour'd head; Grey, purple, yellow, white, or</p>

    <p>brown, Shap'd like War's shield, or Prelate's</p>

    <p>crown —</p>

    <p>Like Freedom's cap, or Friar's cowl, Or</p>

    <p>China's bright inverted bowl -And</p>

    <p>while their broadening disks unfold Gay</p>

    <p>silvery gills, or nets of gold, Beneath</p>

    <p>their shady, curtain'd cove, Perform all</p>

    <p>offices of love.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>Whatever their failings as poetry, these verses reveal an independent mind,</p>

    <p>an observant eye, and a sympathetic heart.</p>

    <p>It is said that there are counties in England, notably in the Midlands, where</p>

    <p>the rhodopaxillus nudus is regularly gathered and offered in the market-places</p>

    <p>under the lovely name of blewits or blue-caps. The country-folk concerned</p>

    <p>with this humble harvest must possess some knowledge of wild mushrooms</p>

    <p>handed down from long ago. They might see the humor, invisible to most</p>

    <p>of their compatriots, in the following episode as told to me by Eric Whittle, an</p>

    <p>understanding English friend: "One day one of our lady audit assistants came</p>

    <p>in with a bag of what I identified afterwards as ceps, which she had bought</p>

    <p>from a hawker. She observed that they were unusual mushrooms but the</p>

    <p>hawker had said they were edible. After a discussion amongst my colleagues</p>

    <p>they were thrown into the dustbin. For my part I was a new member of the</p>

    <p>Staff and my opinion was not asked." (The French <i>cepe</i> is often called in English</p>

    <p>the 'edible boletus', a heavy and unappetizing name, and a misleading one,</p>

    <p>implying as it does that all other boleti are inedible. My friend in his anecdote</p>

    <p>has wisely rendered <i>'cepe'</i> as 'cep', an example that our book follows.)</p>

    <p>Robert Graves has passed on to me another anecdote. During the recent war</p>

    <p>against Germany a Soho restaurateur called Bozzini went gathering ceps in</p>

    <p>Epping Forest near a secret site of the War Office. When charged with spying</p>

    <p>he said, "I'm an innocent mushroom collector." "Show me the mushrooms!",</p>

    <p>replied the policeman. Bozzini produced a suitcase full. "That proves you're</p>

    <p>a spy," said the constable. "Them's toadstools!"</p>

    <p>In 1943, when England was beset by mortal enemies, John Ramsbottom, the</p>

    <p>English mycologist, tried to augment and diversify the spare menu of his</p>

    <p>countrymen by a series of sensible lectures on the edibility of many wild fungi.</p>

    <p>EDIBLE TOADSTOOLS was the caption used by the great <i>Times</i> on September 29,</p>

    <p>1943, in reporting one of these talks. Could a more uninviting headline be</p>

    <p>devised; Things that are merely edible may be scarcely palatable, and toadstools</p>

    <p>by the innermost meaning of the word are unfit for the table. Had a Russian</p>

    <p>been charged with editing that news item, he would have enticed his readers</p>

    <p>with some such headline as WILD MUSHROOMS IN FINE COOKERY.</p>

    <p><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-58_2.jpg" /></p>

    <p>For almost four centuries the Russians and the English-speaking world have</p>

    <p>been eyeing each other, and at one point or another, on one level or another,</p>

    <p>intermingling. Yet among all the many commentaries on Russia published</p>

    <p>in the course of that long association, I know of only four that draw attention</p>

    <p>to the Russian passion for mushrooms. The earliest was by an English traveler,</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p><i>Fig. i</i></p>

    <p>EARLIEST REFERENCE TO</p>

    <p>RUSSIAN FUNGI IN ENGLISH</p>

    <p>Page from Russian-English</p>

    <p>word-list of Richard James,</p>

    <p>1619, citing five kinds of</p>

    <p>mushrooms without English</p>

    <p>equivalents:</p>

    <p><i>ryzhik, guba, gruzd',</i></p>

    <p><i>volonitsa, grib</i></p>

    <p>Bodleian, ms. James 43*</p>

    <p>Richard James, who in 1619, while visiting Muscovy, composed an extensive</p>

    <p>glossary of the Russian language, representing the Russian sounds by a system</p>

    <p>of transliteration of his own devising. He translated all of the Russian words</p>

    <p>into English, but when he came to the various kinds of mushrooms, he had</p>

    <p>to admit defeat: he lists five words and gives no translation! His glossary has</p>

    <p>never been published in full: the manuscript lies in the Bodleian Library.<br /></p>

    <p>From 1660 to 1669 the Tsar Alexei maintained at his court an English phy-</p>

    <p>sician, Samuel Collins, whose valuable little book, <i>The Present State of Russia,</i> ap-</p>

    <p>peared in London anonymously in 1671. The author, unfortunately, died before</p>

    <p>the manuscript was completed, and the concluding chapter, entirely devoted</p>

    <p>to Russian mushrooms, appears to have suffered peculiarly from the ministra-</p>

    <p>tions of an unhappy literary executor. The text of this chapter is a mixture of</p>

    <p>scientific pretensions and fancy, and the illustrations are quaint aberrations.</p>

    <p>Of a different order are the observations of an English clergyman, William</p>

    <p>Coxe, who embarked on a tour of Eastern Europe in 1773 and who in 1784</p>

    <p>brought out in three volumes his <i>Travels into Poland, Russia, Sweden and Denmark.</i></p>

    <p>He was an honest, laborious, and careful observer, whose pedestrian mentality</p>

    <p>saved him from tincturing his observations with fancy. In the opening chapter</p>

    <p>of Book IV he describes the condition of the Russian peasants as he saw them.</p>

    <p>He brings in the mushrooms, and both for this reason and because the whole</p>

    <p>tenor of his favorable comments about the muzhiks runs counter to the pre-</p>

    <p>conceptions of the West on this subject,! shall quote the passage with its context:</p>

    <p>The peasants are well clothed, comfortably lodged, and seem to enjoy plenty of whole-</p>

    <p>some food. Their rye-bread, whose blackness at first disgusts the eye, and whose sourness</p>

    <p>the taste of a delicate traveller, agrees very well with the appetite; as I became reconciled</p>

    <p>to it from use, I found it at all times no unpleasant morsel, and, when seasoned with hunger,</p>

    <p>it was quite delicious: they render this bread more palatable by stuffing it with onions</p>

    <p>and groats, carrots or green corn, and seasoning it with sweet oil. The other articles of</p>

    <p>their food I have enumerated on a former occasion; in this place I shall only observe that</p>

    <p>mushrooms are so exceedingly common in these regions, as to form a very essential part</p>

    <p>of their provisions. I seldom enter a cottage without seeing great abundance of them, and</p>

    <p>in passing through the markets, I was often astonished at the prodigious quantity exposed</p>

    <p>for sale: thek variety was no less remarkable than their number; they were of many</p>

    <p>colours, amongst which I particularly noticed white, black, brown, yellow, green, and</p>

    <p>pink. The common drink of the peasants is quass, a fermented liquor, somewhat like sweet-</p>

    <p>wort, made by pouring warm water on rye or barley-meal; and deemed an excellent anti-</p>

    <p>scorbutic. They are extremely fond of whiskey, a spiritous liquor distilled from malt,</p>

    <p>which the poorest can occasionally command, and which their inclination often leads them</p>

    <p>to use to great excess.</p>

    <p>The worthy Archdeacon Coxe seems not to have asked himself the reason</p>

    <p>for the abundance of mushrooms in the peasants' fare, whether it was owing</p>

    <p>to a greater abundance of fungi in the woods and fields of Russia, or simply</p>

    <p>to the habitual gathering of a normal crop. There is no reason to suppose that</p>

    <p>Russia produces more mushrooms than the United States or England.</p>

    <p>Almost forty years after Mr. Coxe published his <i>Travels,</i> another English</p>

    <p>physician, Dr. Robert Lyall, brought out in 1823 a volume entitled <i>The Char-</i></p>

    <p><i>acter of the Russians,</i> in which he dwelt at length on the Russians' addiction</p>

    <p>to mushrooms. He even undertook to record the common names used by</p>

    <p>the Russians and to identify them.</p>

    <p>The knowledge of edible mushrooms [said Dr. Lyall], like a tradition, has been handed</p>

    <p>down, in Russia, from parent to child, through a series of ages; and the discrimination of</p>

    <p>these, from the hurtful or poisonous mushrooms, is learned by practice, in the years of</p>

    <p>infancy and youth... Indeed [he goes on], mushroom-gathering or hunting forms a great</p>

    <p>part of the occupation of the Russian peasants, boys and girls, as well as of the women at</p>

    <p>times, and is an amusement, in the country, of the nobility, males and females, old and</p>

    <p>young, who make short excursions to the woods in tbe neighborhood of their estates,</p>

    <p>and spend a few hours in selecting one of the greatest delicacies of the epicures.</p>

    <p>With a rare perception of the realities of Muscovite life, Dr. Lyall continued:</p>

    <p>Besides tbe enormous quantities of mushrooms which are brought fresh to market</p>

    <p>during the summer months, and which are immediately bought up, the better sorts by</p>

    <p>the nobility, the inferior kinds by the lower classes and the peasantry, a great abundance</p>

    <p>is preserved by the peasants in the country, who, after retaining a quantity sufficient for</p>

    <p>their own consumption, bring the surplus to town. They are brought throughout the</p>

    <p>whole year, in a dried state on strings, in cart-loads, and sold in all the provision markets,...</p>

    <p>and in all the small grocery-shops in the city. Sometimes even salted and pickled mushrooms</p>

    <p>may be bought.</p>

    <p>After a courageous effort to identify the various kinds of mushrooms, Dr.</p>

    <p>Lyall discusses mushroom cookery:</p>

    <p>Mushrooms are eaten fried, boiled or pickled, while their season endures, by all</p>

    <p>classes. . . . They are fried on hot ashes, or in a frying-pan; they are boiled alone; they</p>

    <p>are boiled with <i>shchi</i> or cabbage soup; they are roasted with butter alone, or oftener with</p>

    <p>butter and <i>smetana</i> or sour cream. They also enter into the composition of some puddings</p>

    <p>and pies. The latter are generally eaten with soup or with <i>shchi.</i> Mushrooms are often</p>

    <p>served up with beef-steak, or roast beef sliced, either alone or mixed with potatoes, carrots,</p>

    <p>turnips, cabbage, asparagus, &amp;c., and sauce. They are excellent when prepared with cutlets</p>

    <p>and rich sauce, duly seasoned.</p>

    <p>Transfixed with apprehension, the Western world seems today in a horrid</p>

    <p>trance, stop-watch in hand, as it gazes on Russia. It is wholesome to read the</p>

    <p>many fine books about Russia that were written in less anxious times, when</p>

    <p>authors and readers were relaxed, and when there were opportunities for deli-</p>

    <p>berate observation.</p>

Smith in his Mushrooms in their Natural Habitats (Sawyer's Inc., Portland, Oregon, 1949) says as he engages in a lengthy discussion of mycophagy, pp. 121-2: "It is impossible for me to discuss the edibility of even the highly recommended species authoritatively from my own experience since I seldom eat them myself".

      <a href="#cp2-r2">[2]</a> Sow-beard = sow-bread; unreported in the Oxford Dictionary in this sense of mushrooms, but familiar as a name for the cyclamen. In Latin <i>tuber</i> meant both &lsquo;truffle&rsquo; and &lsquo;cyclamen&rsquo;, and in Giuseppe Baretti&rsquo;s Italian&ndash;English dictionary, 1832, <i>tartufo</i> is translated by &lsquo;sow-bread, a kind of mushroom growing underground&rsquo;. The addiction of pigs, especially sows, to underground fungi justified the use of this name for truffles.</p>
