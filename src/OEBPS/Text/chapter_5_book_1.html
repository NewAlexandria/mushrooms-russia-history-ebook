      The sinister mark of the toad is not confined to the English fungal vocabulary.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      You will find it in Norwegian and Danish, though not in Swedish; in Low
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      German, Dutch, and Frisian; in Breton, Welsh, and Irish. The romance lan-
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      guages know it not, except for traces in French. Nor does it survive in standard
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      High German, though it lingers on in High German dialects. Thus the citadel
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      of the 'toadstool' is in the ring of peoples who dwell around the shores of the
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      North Sea, a gigantic and evil Fairy Ring, as it were, embracing fringes of the
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Teutonic peoples and the surviving Celts, along with the French. (The Bretons,
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      let it be remembered, emigrated from Britain to their present home across
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      the Channel in the fifth and sixth centuries after Christ, and are thus remote
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      heirs, folkwise, of old Britain.)
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Not all of these peoples use the figure of the toad's stool. The Norwegians
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      and Danes speak of the toad's hat; the Low Germans, of the frog's stool; the
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Dutch say toad's stool; and the Frisians refer to an old fungus as a toad's hide.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      The Irish term is the frog's pouch; the Welsh, toad's cheese; the Bretons,
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      toad's cap, but by the addition of a single initial sibilant, their term becomes
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      toad's stool, and this is a recognized variant in their language. Here are the
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      words in these tongues: in Norwegian and Danish, paddehat; in Low German,
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      poggenstohl; in Dutch, paddestoel; in Frisian, poddehud; in Irish, bolg losgainn, with
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      bolg meaning pouch; in Welsh, caws llyffant, with caws meaning cheese; in
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Breton, kabell tousec, and also skabell tousec. The Pennsylvania Dutch speak a
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      dialect of High German that comes down from the language of the Palatinate in
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      the i8th century, and in Pennsylvania Dutch we find both toad's stool and
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      toad's foot: grottestuhl and grottefuss. We know that toad's bread, pain de crapault,
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      was used for wild fungi in i6th century France, and this same expression has
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      been reported in modern times in the Calvados region of Normandy. The
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      amanita muscaria, with its red cap flecked by warts, is called crapaudin in some
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      parts of France and this word in the form grapaoudin has been reported as far

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      south as the Herault, on the Mediterranean.1

      Rapports avec la Linguistiaue et le Folklore, by Eugene Rolland, Paris, 1914; vol. XI, pp. 129 ff.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      All these words, in varying degrees, exhale a bad odor. They designate wild
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      fungi that the speaker considers, rightly or wrongly, inedible and dangerous.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      The English toadstool, freighted with evil, is typical of the class. In the dia-
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      lects of England there are numerous variants, and these are interesting because
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      they echo the figures of speech that are current in our list of foreign words.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Thus we find toadcheese or taddecheese, toad's bread, toad's cap or toadskep,
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      and toad's meat. For the toad itself there is an ancient variant, pad or paddock,
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      which gives us paddock-stool and puddock-stool. This 'pad' is the same word
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      for toad that the Dutch and Frisians, the Norwegians and Danes, use. This
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      is the witches' word in the opening scene of Macbeth:
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Padock calls anon: faire is foule, and foule is faire,
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Hover through the fogge and filthie ayre.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Here in our argument we interrupt its course for a necessary diversion.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Today civilized men have a kindly feeling for the toad. Lewis Carroll and
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Kenneth Grahame have planted the seeds of their benign influence in the minds
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      of successive generations of well brought up English-speaking children. The
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Victorians were inclined to foster sympathy for the whole animal world.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      (Was this because the industrial revolution released increasing numbers of men
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      from slavery to the soil, from intimate conflict with cantankerous nature?)
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      As for the toad, there has been an additional influence: men of science have
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      undertaken to show that it is the farmer's friend.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Far different was the repute of the toad in times past. There was no other
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      member of the animal kingdom that inspired such revulsion and fear. Chaucer
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      spoke of the 'foule tode', and Spenser of the loathly and venomous toad. 'A
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      pad in the straw' was what our ancestors said when they meant 'a nigger in
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      the woodpile'. (Now that this last phrase is banned in polite society and perhaps
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      vanishing, why not revive the earlier expression?) Shakespere reveled in the
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      toad as a potent term of abuse. In Richard III the toad is a recurring theme,
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      as is fitting for a play about a king described as:
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      That bottel'd Spider, that foule bunch-back'd Toad.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Among all of Shakespere's many references to the toad, there is not one that is
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      neutral, much less friendly. Edgar in King Lear denounces Edmund as 'a most
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      toad-spotted traitor'; and the witches in Macbeth, when they concoct their
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      hellish brew, give to the toad pride of place in the cauldron:
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      Toad, that under cold stone Days
    </div>

    <div>
      <br />
    </div>

    <div>
      and nights hast thirty-one
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1">Swelter'd venom sleeping got, Boil</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thou first i' the charmed pot.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Not only were toads venomous: to the medieval mind they were also a symbol</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of lechery, as were warts and moles, with which toads were supposed to be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">covered. We shall return to this matter of lechery; for the present we only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">direct the reader's attention to the visual use of the toad in this sense by Hierony-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mus Bosch, in his <i class="calibre4">Seven Deadly Sins,</i> of which we reproduce the pertinent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">detail in Plate xm.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The evil repute of the toad is not yet dead. There are English circles where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Toad!' flung in anger would be a fighting insult now. The derivative 'toady'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">brings to mind the sycophantic and hypocritical squat of the creature, with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its upturned watchful eyes. The bad name of the toad survives among un-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tutored countryfolk in England and the United States, where farmers cling to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the belief that the spittle of toads is poisonous, and that warts will grow on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the skin where a toad has touched. French peasants down to recent times, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perhaps even now, put toads to death by methods shocking for their cruelty,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">methods that reveal an ingenuity in torture ordinarily reserved by man for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his fellow-men.1 The venom-spitting toad in all his horrible lineaments was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">painted for us by Hieronymus Bosch in a detail of his <i class="calibre4">Judgment Day.</i> Summoned</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from his grave, a nude Cardinal (his worldly office proclaimed by his hat)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is floating away to everlasting damnation as a squatting toad directs a shaft of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his deadly saliva at the passing corpse.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Toads were closely linked with witchcraft. In France all witches harbored</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toads as their familiars, and this was common in England and Scotland too.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In 1591, trials held in North Berwick elicited from the members of certain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">witches' covens clear testimony that they had tried to murder King James VI</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Scotland, and that one of their plans had been to drop toad's venom on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his head or body, and to smear his small clothes with it.2 Presumably the poison</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was to invade the person of the king through abrasions of the skin, which in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">those days of absent hygiene and parasitic insects were taken for granted. From</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the contemporary records of this case we learn that 'to drop a toad' was the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">idiom used at that time for the milking of a toad's venom - a meaning of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">verb 'to drop' that the Oxford Dictionary fails to record - and in one of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">accounts of the trial we even learn the details of the method used. Here is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">paraphrase of the testimony of Agnis Tompson, a defendant, as published in</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Newes from Scotland Declaring the Damnable Lif and death of Dr. Fian,</i> printed in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">London for William Wright in 1591:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She confessed that she took a blacke Toade, and did hang the same up by the heeles,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">three dales, and collected and gathered the venome as it dropped and fell from it in an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Oister shell, and kept the same venome close couered, untill she should obtaine any parte</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or peece of foule [soiled] linnen cloth, that had appertained to the Kings Maiestie, as shirt,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">handkercher, napkin or any other thing which she practised to obtaine by meanes of one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">John Kers, who being attendant in his Maiesties Chamber, desired him for olde acquain-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tance betweene them, to helpe her to one or a peece of such a cloth as is aforesaide, which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thing the said John Kers denyed to helpe her too, saying he could not help her too it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And the said Agnis Tompson by her depositions since her apprehension saith, that if she</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had obtained any one peece of linnen cloth which the King had worne and fouled, she had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bewitched him to death, and put him to such extraordinary paines, as if he had beene lying</p>

  <p class="calibre1">upon sharp thornes and endes of Needles.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It comes as a shock to modern man to learn that his ancestors considered the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">common toad venomous as the adder. It comes as a double shock to him when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he learns that these ancestors were probably right, and that on this subject</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they were better informed than he is. The toad has no fangs and cannot bite.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But on his coarse skin are scattered numerous glands that look like warts or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pustules; and when the creature is frightened or in pain, these glands exude</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a milky fluid, which is powerfully toxic. Hidden inside the skin, invisible to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the naked eye, is another set of glands, which lubricate the skin with a slimy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mucoid secretion, easily perceived by the human hand but perhaps not poison-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ous. The witches who kept toads as their familiars knew the wicked properties</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the toad's milky secretion, and it is a fair surmise that the singular tortures</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reserved for toads by some countryfolk were originally devised to milk the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toads of their deadly drops. The venom of the toad cannot penetrate healthy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">human skin, but takes hold of any mucous membrane, and if swallowed or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">absorbed through an abrasion of the skin, might well be lethal. Among those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who work with toads, it is common knowledge that their secretions, if acci-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dentally brought into contact with the eyelid, cause an acute burning irritation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(The inflamed swelling of the sebaceous gland at the margin of the eyelid,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">commonly known in English as a stye, is called in vulgar Dutch <i class="calibre4">paddescheet,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">'toad's excrement', even when no toad is involved.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the 15th century Chronicle of St. Albans there is an account of the death</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of King John of England that possesses extraordinary interest both for its own</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sake and for the role played in it by a toad. History relates that the King in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the year 1216 was making his way north with his retinue, dogged by his enemies</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and ill. In crossing the Wash he lost much of his baggage train, to his great</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sorrow, and after lying at the Cistercian monastery at Swineshead, he progressed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">some distance beyond to the castle at Newark-on-Trent, where he died on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">October 19, on "the morrow after St. Luke's Day". The Chronicle of St. Albans</p>

  <p class="calibre1">says that his death was precipitated by a draught of poisoned ale served to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">him at Swineshead. Though perhaps the scribe was only giving currency to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">malicious canard, this scarcely affects the interest of his narrative for us, because</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he was writing what he and his contemporary readers were ready to accept,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the role in the affair that he assigns to a toad conformed to common beliefs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and probably to esoteric knowledge. The provocation that the scribe reports</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the alleged regicide is curious. The King swore a great oath, says the chro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nicler, that if he was spared another six months, the loaf of bread then worth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a ha'penny would be selling at 20 shillings! A modern reader may be excused</p>

  <p class="calibre1">if this passage conjures up for him the specter of runaway inflation, but for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chronicler and his public it meant famine and panic in the market place. Why</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should King John have foreseen famine and panic as the inevitable sequel to his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">own survival &gt; And why should the chronicler, as well as the monk of Swines-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1483, more than 250 years after the event, by the chronicler of St. Albans:1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Kyng came by the Abbey of Swynesheade, and there hee abode two dayes; And as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he sate at mete, he axed a Monke of the house, How moche that loof was worth that was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sette before hym uppon the table &gt; And the Monke said, That the loof was worth but an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That 'great toad' found in the garden at Swineshead could only have been the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">common toad of western Europe, bufo vulgaris. This is the same toad that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">George Ripley, a writer on alchemy, saw in a vision late in the I5th century,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and commemorated in curious verse. His short poem, which we reproduce as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it first appeared in print, eloquently expresses medieval man's repugnance for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the toad, and reveals how intimate Ripley and his circle must have been with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the toad's milky exudate and its fearsome virtue.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our quotations concerning the toad go back to the Middle Ages and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Renaissance, but the ideas therein expressed lived on until recent times. One</p>

  <p class="calibre1">William Northcote, for many years a surgeon in His Majesty's Navy, published</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in London in 1770 a serious medical work, <i class="calibre4">The Marine Practice of Physic and</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Surgery,</i> a reference book for use on ships. In it there is a chapter on poisons,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and coming to the toad, Mr. Northcote has surprising things to say:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The toad is full of venom, and the very centre and repository of terrestrial poisons...</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they discharge their venom on herbs (particularly strawberries) by pissing, spitting, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vomiting; this is not only pernicious by getting into the body, but by being sprinkled on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the skin, unless washed off immediately with urine and salt.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When a person is infected, his skin turns yellow, his body swells universally, his lips</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and tongue grow black, and a stammering supervenes; he is seized with an asthmatic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shortness of breath, vomiting, cold sweats, convulsions, fainting, and at length with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">death, if not timely remedied, [p. 421]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mr. Northcote is guilty of patent absurdities, but the fact remains that we can-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not deny for sure his clinical description of the victims of toad poisoning, for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">modern medical records offer us no histories of such cases. This seasoned practi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tioner of the 18th century was closer than we, chronologically, to the era when</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;"><br /></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">men knew the properties of the toad's venom, and his account of the symptoms</span><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">is the only one emanating from a medical pen known to us. It stands thus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">uncorroborated and unchallenged, a wisp of dubious expert testimony in what</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would otherwise be a scientific vacuum.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1 here exists an additional body of evidence of a different order testifying</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the toad's sinister grip on the popular imagination in times gone by. Men</p>

  <p class="calibre1">take refuge in euphemisms when they talk about things that move them pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">foundly. People 'pass away' rather than 'die', and Satan becomes the 'Evil</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One'. Abhorred creatures are called out of their names, or else their names</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are subjected to irregular distortions in sound.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the languages of Europe few creatures can compete with the toad for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evasive nomenclature. The measure of this tabu lies in the number of etymologi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cally unrelated words for it, not to speak of the variety of dialectical variants</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for each word. Here are a few of the important ones: in Latin <i class="calibre4">bufo,</i> and in Italian,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">rospo</i> and <i class="calibre4">botta;</i> in Spanish, <i class="calibre4">sapo</i> and <i class="calibre4">escuerzo;</i> in French, <i class="calibre4">crapaud</i> and <i class="calibre4">hot;</i> in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">German, <i class="calibre4">Krote;</i> in Russian, <i class="calibre4">zhaba;</i> around the North Sea, <i class="calibre4">padde;</i> and in English,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'toad'. An abundance of diverse names like this makes difficulties for the philolo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gist, who has more to show for his efforts when he goes coursing through the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indo-European languages after words like 'wolf and 'fox', words that turn up in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">more or less regular mutations in various languages. Some of the words for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'toad' defeat the philologists completely. Take 'toad' itself. It exists in several</p>

  <p class="calibre1">variations in English, of which 'tad', as in 'tadpole', is the most important.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is genetically related to the three-syllabled variants in Anglo-Saxon, <i class="calibre4">tadie</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">and <i class="calibre4">tadije.</i> There the trail is lost: no remoter ancestry is known for the word,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and it has no kin in other tongues.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We believe that all, or almost all, of the words for 'toad' in Europe can be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">explained, if we look for the figures of speech that are latent in them by focus-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing our attention on the creature itself. Instead of attacking the 'toad' problem</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by frontal assault, let us approach by a postern gate, viz., through the Celtic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">languages. We know the words for 'toad' in five Celtic languages, and, as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">befits a creature veiled by tabu, the five words appear to be unrelated to each</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other. From ancient Gaul <i class="calibre4">craxantus2</i> survives in a single citation. In Cornish the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. In the second century before Christ an Ionian Greek, Nikander of Colophon, composed a metrical essay</p>

  <p class="calibre1">entitled <i class="calibre4">Alexiphartnaca</i> on poisons and their antidotes, and in lines 567-594 he discusses toad poisoning. His</p>

  <p class="calibre1">observations are obscure, perhaps deliberately so, but in tone they are not far removed from Mr. Northcote's.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As we go to press we learn that Howard F. Fabing, M. D., of Cincinnati, has been giving intravenous in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">jections of bufotenine, the toxic agent secreted by the epidermal glands of the toad, to volunteers in the Ohio</p>

  <p class="calibre1">State Penitentiary.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. See <i class="calibre4">Franzosisches Etymologisches Worterbuch,</i> by Walther von Wartburg.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">toad was <i class="calibre4">croinoc</i> or <i class="calibre4">cronec,</i> and this meant 'the skin' or 'the hide', from <i class="calibre4">croin,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning skin. The Cornishman referred to the toad by its skin, covered as it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is with pustules, and notorious for the way the creature blows itself up with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">air like a sac when making its eerie call. In Welsh the toad is the <i class="calibre4">llyffant;</i> this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">appears to mean 'the slimy one,' with obvious reference to the slippery secretions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the skin. The common toad does not exist in Ireland, and the only toad</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reported there is the bufo calamita, known in English as the natterjack. Its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">range in Ireland is so limited that almost no natives have ever seen a toad:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the natterjack has been found in historic times only over an area of some twenty</p>

  <p class="calibre1">square miles, around Castlemaine Harbor at the head of Dingle Bay in Kerry.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The expression for 'toad' in Irish is 'the poisonous frog' - <i class="calibre4">losgann nimhe;</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">since the word for frog - <i class="calibre4">losgann -</i> means 'the burning one', we arrive ultimately</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at 'the poisonous burning one' - a doubled reference to the toxic, stinging</p>

  <p class="calibre1">secretion of the pustules.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now we turn to the Breton language, and here perhaps we discover a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">loose end to Ariadne's thread, a possible clue to our problem. The word for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toad in Breton is <i class="calibre4">tousec.</i> It comes from the Latin <i class="calibre4">toxicum,</i> and therefore means</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'the poisonous one'. On an earlier page we said that the standard word for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'toadstool' in Breton is <i class="calibre4">kabell tousec,</i> wherein <i class="calibre4">kabell</i> (from the Low Latin <i class="calibre4">cappa</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">and <i class="calibre4">capello]</i> means 'cap'. When the early Bretons spoke of the toadstool as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4">kabell tousec,</i> the term meant to them 'the poison cap', as well as the toad's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cap; and the variant <i class="calibre4">skabell tousec</i> could have meant 'the poison stool' as well</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the toad's stool.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Britain, the island that the Bretons had left behind, are we surprised to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover that the Anglo-Saxon word <i class="calibre4">tosca</i> meant toad ? It is, we submit, identical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the Breton word, offspring of <i class="calibre4">toxicum,</i> and another example of'the poisonous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one'. We have mentioned the English name for the bufo calami ta - the nat-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terjack. We believe that the root of this word is to be found in the Anglo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Saxon word for poison <i class="calibre4">-ator;</i> a word that as 'etter' survived in English for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">centuries, and still circulates in dialect, to designate the venom of a reptile, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the corrupt matter that oozes from a suppurating ulcer or abscess. An 'attercop'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is an old word for a (supposedly poisonous) spider. In modern Dutch <i class="calibre4">etter</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">still means pus. If we are right, what we now call 'a natterjack' was once 'an at-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terjack', the shuttling V being a well known linguistic quirk. The jack' is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">simply the same element that we find in the jumping-jack'. The 'atterjack'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is then a 'poison jack', and an Anglo-Saxon rendering of the Latinism <i class="calibre4">tosca.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Let us pause on <i class="calibre4">tosca,</i> that long forgotten word for the toad. It had a doublet</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. See <i class="calibre4">Lexique Etymologique du Breton Modcrne,</i> by Victor Henry, Rermes, 1900; p. 268.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Anglo-Saxon, <i class="calibre4">taxe,</i> which survives in a single citation. The alternation in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vowels reminds us of 'toad' and 'tad', and also of a parallel in Latin: <i class="calibre4">toxicum</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning 'poison' and <i class="calibre4">taxus,</i> 'yew'. In antiquity the yew was notorious as a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">poisonous tree, and the adjective <i class="calibre4">taxicus</i> was popularly associated with <i class="calibre4">toxicum.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Greek TO^OV meant 'bow' and 'arrow' and 'bow-and-arrows'. Philologists</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are inclined to deny a link between the Greek and the Latin words, and even</p>

  <p class="calibre1">between the Latin words themselves, but concede that the problem is unclear.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Until we know more about the role of bows and poisoned arrows in early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">magic and myth, it is well to suspend judgment. Bows were made of yew,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and arrow-heads were smeared with poison, perhaps from yew. Robert Graves</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has pointed out1 that arrow-heads were sometimes knapped with double tangs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to resemble the yew. The making of such arrow-heads demanded far more</p>

  <p class="calibre1">patience and skill than the simple willow-leaf and elder-leaf points, and would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be less effective in hunting or fighting. They must have been ceremonial in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">function and were undoubtedly bathed in <i class="calibre4">mana.</i> As we look back in recorded</p>

  <p class="calibre1">history, our 'toad' or 'tad' emerges from the Anglo-Saxon world as the ven-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">omous helpmeet of sorcerers. The very name of the creature, <i class="calibre4">tousec</i> or <i class="calibre4">tosca</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">or <i class="calibre4">taxe,</i> is redolent with poison, potent with <i class="calibre4">mana.</i> Down through the Middle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ages and into modern times the toad was still freighted with this primitive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cargo of evil. <i class="calibre4">Tosca</i> and <i class="calibre4">taxe</i> may have contributed to the shaping of our words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'toad' and 'tad'. As we said before, the etymology of 'toad' is unknown. We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must consider the possibility that, by steps that may forever remain obscure,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Anglo-Saxon words come down to us in 'toad' and 'tad' by lineal descent.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The irregular mutation of <i class="calibre4">-sc-</i> and <i class="calibre4">-x-</i> into 'd' could have been a euphemistic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">substitution.2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If 'toad' descends etymologically to us from <i class="calibre4">toxicum,</i> then in English as in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Breton tongue a 'toadstool' in its ultimate meaning is a 'poison stool', and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">idea of poison, rather than the toad, may have been dominant in the minds of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">those who first applied this term to the wild fungi in the Anglo-Saxon world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In any case, whatever the etymology, the cultural soil in which 'toad' had its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beginnings explains that aura of abhorrence which bathes the word to this</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. See his <i class="calibre4">White Goddess, a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth,</i> Creative Age Press, New York, 1948, footnote</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on p. 320; also p. 38.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. If Latin <i class="calibre4">-x-</i> became <i class="calibre4">-s-</i> in <i class="calibre4">tosca,</i> then the Anglo-Saxon word results from the omission of the middle syllable,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">toxicum</i> becoming <i class="calibre4">tos'ca.</i> But if <i class="calibre4">-x-</i> by phonetic transposition became <i class="calibre4">-sc-</i> we arrive directly at <i class="calibre4">tosca</i> by the ero</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sion of the last syllable. If <i class="calibre4">taxe</i> or a hypothetical <i class="calibre4">toxe</i> became by euphemistic mutation <i class="calibre4">tadse</i> or <i class="calibre4">todse,</i> the evolu</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion into 'toad' or 'tad' is easy, the sibilant being lost by a popular back-formation of an erroneous singular; cf.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'toad's stool' which becomes 'toad-stool'; also 'pea', 'asset', 'shay', 'sherry', 'cherry', etc., all of which have lost</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the sibilant with which they originally ended. The mutation of 'c' into 't' is not altogether conjectural. In the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Anglo-Saxon dictionary of Joseph Bosworth and T. Northcote Toller, under <i class="calibre4">tosca,</i> we find a quotation in which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the plural of <i class="calibre4">tosca</i> appears with 't', - <i class="calibre4">tostan.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">day in the English language. We discover why the Oxford Dictionary fails to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">satisfy us when it dismisses the problem of the toadstool by calling it a 'fanciful'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">term. We realize why the headline in <i class="calibre4">The Times,</i> EDIBLE TOADSTOOLS, shocks us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as a contradiction in terms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have already observed that the Irish word for 'frog' is the 'burning one'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here again the reference is to the secretion of the epidermal glands of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amphibian, the secretion that stings when it comes into touch with a mucous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">membrane. This Irish word has its parallels in certain of the Germanic languages.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Old High German the verb 'to burn' was <i class="calibre4">zusken,</i> and by regular mutation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of sounds this explains the Danish word for the toad, <i class="calibre4">tudse,</i> in which today</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the letter <i class="calibre4">d</i> is silent. In Swedish the corresponding word is <i class="calibre4">tossa,</i> with dialect-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ical variants <i class="calibre4">tosk</i> and <i class="calibre4">tusk;</i> and there also survives a citation from 1652 in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">form <i class="calibre4">tadza,</i> pronounced perhaps as 'totsa' would be in English. In all these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words the toad is called the 'burning one', as the frog is in Irish. These words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">find their semantic parallel in the vulgar Dutch term <i class="calibre4">paddescheet,</i> the stye with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its burning sting, to which we called attention earlier. In Greek the word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for toad, eppOvo?, is usually explained as meaning 'the brown one', but brown</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is the burnt color, and Professor Andre Martinet has suggested that cpptivoc;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">may refer to burning rather than to the color.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We know that the secretion of toads was used by the practitioners of witchcraft.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We know that in ancient Rome the lethal properties of the wild fungus known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the deadly amanita or destroying angel or death cup were familiar to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">practitioners of venomy, as we choose to call the art of murder by poison. But</p>

  <p class="calibre1">no positive evidence survives, so far as we know, to show that in the practice</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of witchcraft the secrets of the fungi were utilized; no evidence, that is, beyond</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'toadstool' itself, this humble folkword with its secret message. Does the absence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of positive evidence mean that the toadstool was not used in the practices of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Old Religion, or that the secret was successfully kept? For the present we leave</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the answer to the reader.</p>
