  <p class="calibre1">It might seem that by now we had exhausted the erotic imagery of the fungal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world, wherein fire, mucus, noses, candles, and mushrooms dance together in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">throbbing surrealist fandango, the whole obscene performance conducted inside</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the uterine envelope of the primeval&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">gamba.</i>&nbsp;But not so. We have yet to speak</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of truffles.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Greeks used various words for underground fungi, but we think we can</p>

  <p class="calibre1">prove that the ύδνον was our truffle. In the Morgan codex of Dioscorides there</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is a miniature accompanying the section on the ύδνον that gives us our earliest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pictorial representation of a&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tuber</i>&nbsp;buried in the earth, and an excellent repre-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sentation it is.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The truffle in Latin was the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tuber,</i>&nbsp;which took the form of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tufer</i>&nbsp;in an Oscan or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Umbrian dialect. The Romans knew various kinds of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tuber.</i>&nbsp;The most esteemed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were from Africa, and were probably not true truffles but an underground fungus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known to science today by the name of terfezia. From the Latin word came the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">truffe,</i>&nbsp;the Spanish&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">trufa,</i>&nbsp;and the English 'truffle'. From a form supposed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to have been&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">terrae tufer</i>&nbsp;the Italians arrived at the modern&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tartufo</i>&nbsp;and a dimi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nutive&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tartuffola.</i>&nbsp;The surprising thing is that this last word turns up in German</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the name for the potato,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Kartoffel,</i>&nbsp;and from there spread eastward throughout</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Slavic lands, until today half of Europe calls the potato by the word that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">originally meant 'truffle'! In our view the explanation for this curious trans-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fer of meaning lies in the preoccupation with aphrodisiacs of i6th century</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Europe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Ponce de Leon embarked on his quest for the Fountain of Youth,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he was bent on discovering a sensational aphrodisiac of lasting virtue. What a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">prize would be his if he could present to the Old World a miraculous bath to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">supersede all the amatory prescriptions in traditional use! Among those traditional</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inciters to venery none enjoyed higher esteem than truffles, and indeed this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reputation of theirs survives into our own times. No pages in Brillant-Savarin's</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Physiologic du Gout</i>&nbsp;are more delightful than those devoted to a judicial weighing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the evidence in this matter of truffles and love. There are many kinds of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">subterranean fungi, of which some are entitled to be called truffles; and of these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">true truffles, a few species are esteemed by gourmets. In Spanish,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">trufa</i>&nbsp;is the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name given to a truffle of high culinary worth. There are two other terms used</p>

  <p class="calibre1">generally for the underground fungi:&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">turma</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">criadilla de tierra.</i>&nbsp;These are both</p>

  <p class="calibre1">interesting, expressing as they do the aphrodisiacal virtue attributed to the whole</p>

  <p class="calibre1">166</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SECRETS OF THE TRUFFLE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tribe of underground fungi.&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Turma</i>&nbsp;in Catalan means 'testicle', and in Spanish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it means both 'testicle' and 'truffle'. It is an old word, probably of pre-Roman</p>

  <p class="calibre1">origin, coming down from the same Indo-European root 'tu' that gives to Latin</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tuber</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tumor,</i>&nbsp;the idea of organic swelling being inherent in them ah1.&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Cria-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">dilla</i>&nbsp;is the standard word in Spanish for 'testicle'. It is the word used for lamb's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fries, the French&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">amourette.</i>&nbsp;The Spaniards' words for the truffle reveal the precious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">virtue that these earthy growths were supposed to possess.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Immediately after the Spaniards fell on America in the idth century, they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discovered in the New World first the sweet potato1 and then the potato, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">batata</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">papa.</i>&nbsp;They found the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">batata</i>&nbsp;in the Antilles, probably in Hispa-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">niola: the word first appears in 1516, a borrowing from the Taino Indians who</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were then living in the Greater Antilles and Bahamas. (Their name should he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pronounced in three syllables, as though written 'Taino'.) The Tainos deserved</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a kinder fate than was theirs: they and their language are now dead these many</p>

  <p class="calibre1">generations, and few today know even the tribal name of these first victims of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the invaders from Europe. The Tainos possessed a tongue belonging to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Arawakan family of Indian languages, which were spoken by tribes scattered at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the time of the Conquest all the way from Florida and the Bahamas on the north</p>

  <p class="calibre1">through the Greater Antilles and across the tropical belt of South America as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">far south as what is now known as Matto Grosso. These Tainos of the Islands</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were a gentle folk: they seemed to lend verisimilitude to the medieval dreams</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a Golden Age, and gave impetus to the notion of the Noble Savage that was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">destined to captivate intelligent men in the Age of Reason. The blameless Taino</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cultivated sweet potatoes and maize, smoked tobacco, slept in a hammock,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and plied the sea ways in long 'canoas'. The Spaniards remarked on the unifor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mity of the Taino language throughout the various Islands - clearly in the Taino</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world the sea was a highway to speed communications and not an insulating</p>

  <p class="calibre1">barrier. Today even scholars often confuse the winsome Tainos with their fero-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cious enemies, known variously in the idth century as the Caribs or Calibs or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Canibs, a race of savage warriors who when the Spaniards arrived had already</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seized the Lesser Antilles and were harassing the Tainos on the larger islands.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Europeans quickly overwhelmed them both. But all unawares, by a natural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">filtering of the Indian vocabularies, the world distinguishes to this day between</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these two lost and almost forgotten peoples. From the language of the Tainos</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we possess a legacy of five common and friendly words: potato, maize, tobacco,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hammock, and canoe. From the Canibs came our 'cannibals', and the bestial</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. We are familiar with the evidence indicating prior knowledge of the sweet potato in Polynesia, which has</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stirred up discussions that do not concern us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Caliban whom Shakespere placed in the still-vex'd Bermoothes was the liter-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ary scion of the Calibs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Tainos certainly did not attribute aphrodisiacal powers to the <i class="calibre4">batata</i> or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sweet potato. They could not have been under illusions about this humble</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vegetable, so commonplace for them. But the Spaniards, obsessed by the idea of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">aphrodisiacs, were quick to discover in the <i class="calibre4">batata</i> a new and more potent truffle.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(Were they under a temptation to hold the novel food to blame for their excesses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the native womenfolk?) A few years later they discovered the white potato</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Andean highlands, the <i class="calibre4">papa</i> as it was called in Quechua, the language of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Inca and his people. Now the story repeats itself: Agustin de Zarate, in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">classic account of the conquest of Peru, published in 1555, informs his readers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the white potato is like the <i class="calibre4">turma de tierra,</i> 'earth's testicle', the truffle of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">precious virtue:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">... y los indios comen unas rakes que llaman <i class="calibre4">papas,</i> que son de hechura y aun casi</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sabor de turmas de tierra. . . [BOOK, in, Chap. 12]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This work was promptly translated by Thomas Nicholas and published in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">London in 1581. Since truffles were unknown to the English, we were eager</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to see how the excellent Nicholas met his difficulty in rendering the sentence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where they are mentioned:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">... The Indians of this province eateth certaine Rootes called <i class="calibre4">Papas,</i> whiche are verie</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like bothe in makynge and taste Turnepes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How the humble turnip is here exalted, and the truffle humbled! Were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffles ever so grossly maligned before or since?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Shortly after the batata, the Spaniards brought back from the New World</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the white potato, and from Spain it reached Italy before 1588, where it was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">called <i class="calibre4">taratouffli,</i> the Italian word for 'truffles', a translation of the Spanish name</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but without the strong erotic association of <i class="calibre4">turmas.</i> Quickly thereafter it ap-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peared in the Low Countries, Switzerland, and Germany, and then in France.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It arrived in England after the sweet potato but before the end of the century.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The two vegetables became deeply entangled in verbal confusion. In Spanish-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speaking America the white potato is widely known to this day as the <i class="calibre4">papa,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">a name clothed with all the rights of chronological and topographical primacy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But this word took no hold in Europe and batata served for both vegetables,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">finally in England attaching itself for good to the wrong plant. The Spaniards</p>

  <p class="calibre1">compounded the confusion by also bestowing on the new vegetables their own</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name for truffles. To this day in some parts of Colombia potatoes are <i class="calibre4">turmas</i> or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SECRETS OF THE TRUFFLE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'testicles', and in Spain they were known as <i class="calibre4">criadillas</i> and <i class="calibre4">trufas.</i> In the dialect</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Aragon <i class="calibre4">trufa</i> has been reported in the form <i class="calibre4">triunfa -</i> a popular malformation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that suggests the amorous triumph assured to the hopeful consumer <i class="calibre4">of criadillas.1</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">For a time potatoes remained a rarity, priced high in keeping with the virtue</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attributed to them. Their appearance in England points up a curious cultural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phenomenon. Reaching England by way of Spain, both kinds of potatoes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">while in transit assumed like changelings the amatory reputation of the truffle.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thus it came about that England took delivery of America's gifts with a Spanish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">billing, never suspecting that the humble vegetables from the New World</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were now sailing on a false invoice, their genuine virtues lost from view in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the resplendent aura befitting a newly discovered and miraculous aphrodisiac.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The craze for aphrodisiacs seized England too. Falstaff in <i class="calibre4">The Merry Wives</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">of Windsor</i> invokes them. "Let the skie raine Potatoes", he exclaims, and "haile</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kissing-Comfits, and snow Eringoes", these latter being the candied root of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sea-holly, known to science as the eryngium maritimum. Caviar in Elizabethan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times was yet another erotic stimulant, as Sir John Harington, godson of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Queen, reminds us in his unabashed epigram 'Against an Old Letcher':</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Since thy third cariage of the French infection</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Priapus hath in thee found no erection: Yet eatst</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thou Ringoes, and potato Rootes, And Gaueare</p>

  <p class="calibre1">[caviar], but it litle bootes. Besides at thy beds-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">heads', a bottle lately found, Of Liquor that a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quart cost twenty pound.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For shame, if not more grace, yet shew more wit,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Surcease, now sinne leaues thee, to follow it. Some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">smile, I sigh, to see they madness such That that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which stands not stands thee in so much.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those 'potatoes' in Shakespere were certainly sweet potatoes; in Harington,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we are not sure.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For almost a thousand years after the fall of Rome, there seems to be no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mention of truffles in surviving documents.2 In the I3th century Albertus Magnus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. We are indebted to Professor Juan Corominas for the etymology of <i class="calibre4">turma.</i> For the early usage of names for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">potatoes and sweet potatoes, there is a beautiful monograph by Pedro Henriquez Urefia, <i class="calibre4">Para la Historia de los</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Indigenismos,</i> published by the Institute de Filologia, under the auspices of the Facultad de Filosofia y Letras of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the University of Buenos Aires, 1938, to which Professor Yakov Malkiel called our attention. See also entry</p>

  <p class="calibre1">under <i class="calibre4">Criadilla</i> in C. Torres Fornes' <i class="calibre4">Sobre Voces Aragonesas usadas en Segorbe,</i> Valencia, 1903. But neither Henri</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quez Urefia nor Torres Fornes mentions the erotic theme injected into the potato nomenclature by the Spaniards.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The early references to the potato in the herbals are fully discussed by Redcliffe N. Salaman in his <i class="calibre4">History</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">and Social Influence of the Potato,</i> Cambridge University Press, 1949.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. We except of course the references in copies of the ancient authors. The reference in the <i class="calibre4">Etymologies</i> of St.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Isidore of Seville is no more than a repetition of ancient sources.</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_74">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">speaks of them in <i class="calibre4">De <b class="calibre5">Vegetabilibus,</b></i> but hesitantly and vaguely, and without</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reference to aphrodisiacal properties. This vagueness seems not to have been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">accidental. In the <i class="calibre4">Hortus Sanitatis,</i> printed in Mainz in 1491, the artist who made</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the woodcuts showed more courage than discretion when he illustrated the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">section on the <i class="calibre4">tuber.</i> Never has there been a more grievous misrepresentation</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Fig. 10</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mainz, 1491.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a fungus. We know not whether Albertus Magnus and he had never seen a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffle, or whether, knowing truffles, they failed to identify them with the Latin</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tuber.</i> In the earliest of printed cookbooks, <i class="calibre4">De Honesta Voluptate,</i> published in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Rome in the middle 1470'$ and attributed to Bartolomeo de' Sacchi called</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Platina, there is a short section on truffles. The author speaks of those that come</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from Africa and the Near East, and then he refers to the species that sensual men</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of fashion consume to whet their appetite for love-making. With an amusing lack</p>

  <p class="calibre1">170</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SECRETS OF THE TRUFFLE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of humor he goes on to observe that if this is done for procreation, it is praise-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">worthy, but if for debauchery, as is the case (he says) with many idle and in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">temperate persons, it is to be altogether despised. No trace of scepticism diluted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the faith of this author in the peculiar virtue attributed to truffles. Doubtless</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there are earlier references to these as aphrodisiacs, but we have not come</p>

  <p class="calibre1">upon them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By the i6th century the fashion for truffles was at its height. They reached this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peak of esteem at the moment when potatoes arrived from the Andes, via Spain.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The two were confused in Spain, as we have seen, and it is hardly surprising</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to find that they came to be confused in France, Italy, and Germany. <i class="calibre4">Tartufi</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">bianchi</i> has been an alternative designation for potatoes in Italy down to recent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times, a use of <i class="calibre4">tartufo</i> that is facilitated by the supremacy in Italy of a white</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffle, the tuber magnatum. This is the truffle that in Italian restaurants is com-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">monly served raw, in thinnest slices. It suggests the flavor of garlic, but unlike</p>

  <p class="calibre1">garlic does not repeat itself. Across the Alps in the Dauphine, the peasants in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their patois have been reported in modern times as using the term <i class="calibre4">triffe niere</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">to designate both the truffle and a kind of potato with a purplish flesh.1 In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Germany there is a common fungus, with white flesh, about five inches in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">diameter, that grows either half-buried or just under the ground in oak forests.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is aromatic and edible, and mycologists know it as the choiromyces meandri-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">formis - the meandering pig-fungus. It looks like a potato, and the initial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">confusion between the familiar fungus and the novel potato must have con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tributed to the permanent hold of the word <i class="calibre4">Kartoffel</i> in Germany, whence it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">spread with the potato in due course to Scandinavia and the Slavic lands. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">turn the Russians carried the word across Siberia and to the Eskimos of Alaska,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where in various dialects of the Eskimo language we find the potato of the Andes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">called by names that reach straight back to the <i class="calibre4">tuber</i> of Pliny: <i class="calibre4">kaltu:jilaq</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">kaltu:Jaq</i> and <i class="calibre4">kaltuvaq</i> and <i class="calibre4">kaltu:xaq?</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">That initial confusion of potatoes with truffles which began in Spain in Re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">naissance times has never completely died. Van Sterbeeck surprises and amuses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the modern reader when in his <i class="calibre4">Theatrum Fungorum,</i> a work exclusively dealing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with fungi published in 1675, he devotes a section to potatoes and other members</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the nightshade family! If the reader will examine again the frontispiece to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Van Sterbeeck's book, which we reproduce on Plate XXVIII, he will discover</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among all the mushrooms one basket that is spilling potatoes on the ground. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. See <i class="calibre4">La Truffe,</i> by Adolphe Chatin, Paris, 1892, pp. 303 ff.</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_75">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Russia down into the present century the Old Believers of the Moscow region</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were still rejecting potatoes, which they would spurn as <i class="calibre4">sobach'i mude,</i> dog's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">testicles; this was recorded in 1915 by Roman Jakobson in the neighborhood</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Vereja. We discover the same associations lingering on in certain metaphors</p>

  <p class="calibre1">current in Spanish America, but here we arrive at the inner meaning only by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a series of transitions. The Spaniards thought truffles were aphrodisiacs, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they considered sweet potatoes, the <i class="calibre4">batatas</i> of the Antilles, a superior truffle.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The word <i class="calibre4">batata</i> never spread much on the American mainland, where sweet</p>

  <p class="calibre1">potatoes came to be called <i class="calibre4">camotes,</i> the name for the vegetable in Nahuatl, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">language of the Aztecs. Today in many parts of Spanish-speaking America</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">camote</i> is a metaphor used for 'being in love'. It also means a lie or exaggeration,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and thus recalls the disillusion of those who relied on the virtue attributed to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sweet potato.1 Finally, the old error, fossilized, persists to this day in circles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where one might least expect it: botanists and mycologists use the word 'tuber'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for both potatoes and truffles, thus embalming in their unhappy nomenclature</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the hoary blunder.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is a tradition that the vogue of the truffle in France and Italy came from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spain during the Renaissance, and that it attained its exalted place on the tables</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the mighty in the reign of Francois I. It certainly soared to new renown in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the 16th century, but the survival in France and Italy of the local names derived</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the Latin <i class="calibre4">tuber</i> is evidence that on humbler and less articulate levels the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffle had not been wholly forgotten in the silent centuries reaching back to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Roman times. In Paris, however, the truffle was adorning only the most aristo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cratic tables down almost to the French Revolution, Brillat-Savarin asserts</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">revival of the truffle is quite recent. . . One can even say that the present generation has</p>

  <p class="calibre1">almost witnessed it. Toward 1780 truffles were rare in Paris, to be found, and then in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">small quantities, only at the Hotel des Americains and the Hotel de la Provence. A turkey</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stuffed with truffles was a luxury to be found only on the tables of the great, or in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">homes of kept women . . . At the moment when I write these lines [1825] one can say</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the glory of the truffle has reached its apogee.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With the rise of the bourgeoisie following the French Revolution, new layers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of society acquired a taste for the delicacy and by their demand for it brought</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about an immense increase in the harvest. In the i6th century various kinds of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffles had competed for favor in France, but by Brillat-Savarin's time the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tuber melanosporum of Perigord had established its primacy and become perhaps</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. The metaphorical meanings of <i class="calibre4">camote</i> are cited by Hennquez Urefia in his monograph to which we acknow-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ledged our indebtedness in a footnote on page 169, but he does not try to explain those meanings.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">172</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SECRETS OF THE TRUFFLE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the supreme delight of the haute cuisine. Meanwhile that other tuber, the potato,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thanks to the ingenious and bold promotion of the famous Antoine-Augustin</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Parmentier, had finally, in the lyyo's, gained acceptance as a worthy food for a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gentleman's table in France.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The reputation of the truffle as an erotic stimulant has an elusive history. This</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reputation was certainly endemic in Spain, expressing itself as it did in the names</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">criadilla</i> and <i class="calibre4">turma.</i> The culture of the Iberian peninsula is strong in archaic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">traits, and this would suggest that the peculiar repute of the truffle goes back</p>

  <p class="calibre1">far. We have not arrived at the indigenous names for the truffle in the other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Indo-European languages, such as those of India. In the Sind, as an example,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there is a fungus that in Sindhi is called <i class="calibre4">saitan jo pelo,</i> Satan's testicles. But we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">know not its identity: is it a truffle?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps the Spaniards in their century of great influence were responsible for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">spreading the belief that truffles were aphrodisiacs. This is a tempting hypothesis.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yet there is certain subtle evidence suggesting that an indigenous tradition of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same kind prevailed in Central Europe, notably in Germany and Bohemia.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For centuries the hunting of the stag in Europe was the noblest expression of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the chase. This stag was the male of the red deer. Norman Douglas in <i class="calibre4">Paneros</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">has pointed out that the genitalia of the stag were coveted as precious inciters to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">venery. Now here is an interesting fact that Douglas did not know: there exists</p>

  <p class="calibre1">an underground fungus distinct from the truffle that is called in German the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Hirschtruffel -</i> the stag's truffles. In English botanical works already a century</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ago it was called 'hart's truffle', and also 'hart's balls' and 'deer balls'. The cor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">responding names in French and Spanish are <i class="calibre4">truffe du cerfznd criadilla de ciervo.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have no evidence that these words circulated outside the covers of books:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they could be bookish renderings of the German term. One should look for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">such terms in the vocabulary peculiar to traffickers in aphrodisiacs and their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clientele, and source materials for this dubious area of cultural activity have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eluded us. We suspect that our hart's truffles would be found therein. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scientist's name for this genus of fungus is a scientist's neo-Greek rendering</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the German name: elaphomyces.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As to the ripe age of the German name there can be no doubt. Before 1544</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Valerius Cordus, in his <i class="calibre4">Adnotationes,</i> commented most curiously on the stag's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffle. Truffles were thought to be earth's testicles and aphrodisiacs, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stag's testicles were also aphrodisiacs. From this it was only a step to suppose that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the underground fungi were generated from the spilled seed of stags! Here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is a pretty illustration of the way men's minds work by false analogies, taking</p>

  <p class="calibre1">figures of speech literally. But this is not all. Why were these underground fungi</p>

  <p class="calibre1">173</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_161"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_76">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">related to the genitalia of stags and no other animals &gt; We believe that beneath</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the surface of the words of Valerius Cordus we detect a further punning analogy,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a foolish confusion caused by homonyms, and yet a confusion possessing a certain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">extraordinary iridescence.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There are two words spelled Venery' in English. One of them is derived</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from 'Venus' and means sexual lust. The other is derived from the Latin <i class="calibre4">venari,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning 'to hunt'. In sound these two words run parallel to each other through-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out the Romance languages and medieval Latin. Indeed, when we go back</p>

  <p class="calibre1">behind Latin, we discover that both words, Venus and <i class="calibre4">venari,</i> descend from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same root, a root cousin to the English verb 'to win'. He who pursues and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">brings down the game is engaged in the same order of activity as he who brings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">down a mate. 'Venery' in its application to the chase relates to the noblest kind</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of hunting, the coursing of the stag. And this leads us to suggest the play on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words that probably explains the kinship of truffles to stags. The aphrodisiacal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffles in the earth are earth's testicles, fruit of the stag's truffles, and both are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shot through with venery. Venery in both senses loomed large in the conscious-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ness of the 16th century European. We suggest that this common denominator</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the homonyms, albeit unexpressed in the text of Valerius Cordus, was in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">back of his mind, consciously or unconsciously, as he wrote out his quaint</p>

  <p class="calibre1">observations about hart's truffles:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pharmacopolse etiam in suis OfEcinis Fungos habent, quos Boletos et Fungos ceruinos</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vocant. Ferunt eos in sylvis ex semine cervorum enasci, et propterea Venerem stimulare:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sed falsum hoc est. Inueni enim hos Ceruinos fungos in prseruptissimis montium syluis,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quo ne Damae et Rupicaprse quidem peruenire possent, nedum cerui. Nee verisimile est</p>

  <p class="calibre1">eos venerem stimulare, cum frigidum, pituitosum, crudum, et malignum succum in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">humane corpore gignant. Quae enim Venerem accendere debent, contrarias facultates</p>

  <p class="calibre1">et qualitates habere necesse est.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Apothecaries, in fact, have in their establishments fungi which they call boleti and stag</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungi. They say that these originate in the woods from the seed of stags, and hence</p>

  <p class="calibre1">excite the sexual impulse; but this is false. For I have found these stag fungi in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">densest mountain groves, which not even fallow deer and chamois could reach, not to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mention stags. Nor is it likely that they excite the sexual urge, as they engender cold,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phlegmy, raw, and evil humor in the human body. Things that are to inflame the sexual</p>

  <p class="calibre1">impulses must have opposite faculties and characteristics.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Cordus, who was German, was writing this passage shortly before 1544, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">year of his premature death. His text does not suggest that the lust-inciting virtue</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attributed to the fungi was a novelty for him, nor foreign in inspiration. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was clearly challenging a tradition native to his German world. But Cordus,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the stags in the mountain groves. Did not the erotic names for the truffles refer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rather to the Horned God of the pagan world? In 1920 the Abbe Breuil and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Count Begouen published1 a prehistoric design that they had discovered engraved</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the walls in the innermost recess of the Caverne des Trois Freres, at Montes-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quieu-Avantes, Ariege. It represented a man costumed for a primitive religious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rite. On his head he wore antlers. The upper part of his face was owlish, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lower part covered by a long beard. The skin of a wild beast, perhaps a stag,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is swung over his body. His hands are in a clawing posture. A horse's tail pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">trudes from the rear. He could easily be the remote progenitor of the Robin</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Goodfellow illustrated on page 83. The ancient artist leaves the beholder in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">no doubt concerning the importance that he attributes to <i class="calibre4">las criadillas de ciervo,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the hart's truffles. By this interpretation the aphrodisiacal metaphor suddenly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">takes on a pulsating vitality, and the two meanings of 'venery' coalesce. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">horns of Robin Goodfellow and of the god of the prehistoric cave also appear</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in a new light. Our ancestors never tired of their jokes about the cuckold's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">horns - the symbols of his humiliation. R. Lowe Thompson in his <i class="calibre4">History</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">of the Devil,</i> published in New York in 1929, suggested that originally these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">horns were the horns of the 'Satan' who ofEciated at the rites of the witches'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coven. Certainly this interpretation quickens a stale figure of speech, and gives</p>

  <p class="calibre1">added piquancy to the priapism of Robin Goodfellow.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vv e might now call a halt to our discussion of fungal aphrodisiacs, were it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not for a singular phenomenon that we discover in the Czech language. Alone</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among the Slavs, the Czechs pay attention, by native tradition, to the world of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffles. For the underground fungi they possess two words, both native. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">true truffle is <i class="calibre4">lanyz,</i> and the hart's truffle is <i class="calibre4">thejelenka.</i> The name of the true truffle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">comes from <i class="calibre4">Ian,</i> the word that designates the roe or hind of the red deer. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name of the hart's truffle comes <i class="calibre4">faomjelen,</i> which designates the stag. A peculiar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">aspect of these words is the shift in genders that takes place:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MASCULINE FEMININE</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">jelen</i> (stag)</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Ian</i> (hind)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">176</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SECRETS OF THE TRUFFLE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">What lies behind this criss-crossing of genders ? In some medieval Czech text</p>

  <p class="calibre1">someone may discover the answer, perhaps in a manuscript dealing with love</p>

  <p class="calibre1">philtres. Meanwhile we suggest as a working hypothesis that the hart's truffle,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">jelenka,</i> was prescribed for women, and the hind's truffle, <i class="calibre4">lanyz,</i> for men. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">addition to the hart's truffle, <i class="calibre4">jelenka</i> is the Czech name for the mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known as the phallus impudicus, and a related name, <i class="calibre4">jelenice,</i> is used for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hydnum imbricatum, a species that by its shape is also erotically suggestive.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The <i class="calibre4">Czech jelenka</i> in its fungal application is semantically and mycologically</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a precise equivalent of the German <i class="calibre4">Hirschbrunst,</i> 'hart's rut', showing that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Czechs and Germans shared a faith in the aphrodisiacal virtues of the phallus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">impudicus <i class="calibre4">(Hirschbrunst iiber der Erde)</i> and the hart's truffles <i class="calibre4">(Hirschbrunst unter der</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Erde).</i> J. G. Gleditsch in his <i class="calibre4">Methodus Fungorum</i> (1753) wrote condescendingly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Moravian peasant girls who used certain dried phalloidaceae to cure</p>

  <p class="calibre1">warts and corns, according to him without success; and how these fungi, air-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dried or smoked, were thought to stimulate venery in dogs and horses. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">added that rustics used them even on themselves. Mrs. Ulehlova-Tilschova in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">her book on Czech folk food, <i class="calibre4">Ceska strava lidovd,</i> has lately reported an East</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Moravian name for true truffles, <i class="calibre4">barant vajca,</i> 'lamb's fries' or testicles.1 Later in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same work she calls attention to the important role played by fungi in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ritual dinner on Christmas eve in Bohemia, when the mushrooms are served</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in a soup or as gravy or mixed with cereal. The precise meaning of the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms consumed on this annual occasion survives in men's memories in southern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bohemia, near Tabor, where the mushrooms are served with millet and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dish is called <i class="calibre4">kuba</i> or <i class="calibre4">manas.</i> The word <i class="calibre4">ntanas</i> means a lusty male, and he who eats</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the dish is imbued with extra virility for the coming year.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">John Parkinson, obviously relying on Central European sources, published</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in his <i class="calibre4">Theatrum Botanicum2</i> in 1640 certain curious facts about the use of hart's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffles or elaphomyces as aphrodisiacs and in medication:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">These be not eaten in the same manner as the former [true truffles], that is for meate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or food, but as a medicament being cut into peeces, and dryed upon strings put through</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them to be used upon occasion: while they are fresh they have a strong and evill sent,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which they lose in the drying, and are used either alone one dramme and a halfe in pouther,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">taken with sweete wine or with other things as provoke venery, as also to increase milke</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. See pp. 54-5 for this and other examples of the rich popular terminology for fungi in Czech; for the references</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the mushrooms served on Christmas Eve see pp. 345 ff. In standard Czech <i class="calibre4">barani vajca</i> would be <i class="calibre4">beranl vejce.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. Parkinson in this work offers us the first reference in English to truffles, which he calls 'Spanish trubbes'. 'Trub'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would suggest a Spanish form <i class="calibre4">truba,</i> which has never been reported. Parkinson cites a passage in Athenaeus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as authority for the aphrodisiacal virtue of truffles, but we have not found it. The ancients probably held such a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">belief, but we know of not a single reference in ancient writers to fungi as aphrodisiacs, in spite of the phallic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">symbolism of the μύκης.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rdere our story of the truffle would end, had not Moliere by a stroke of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">genius created the character of Tartuffe. By the criterion of price, by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">prestige of its <i class="calibre4">parfum,</i> by its erotic associations, the truffle holds a position of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">primacy in the fungal world. To all these distinctions it adds literary immortality:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Tartuffe hypocrisy finds its supreme artistic incarnation. In Tartuffe's fungal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name the truffle was woven into the very warp and woof of Europe's cultural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tapestry.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">What led Moliere to 'Tartuffe' ? This is not a French family name: the nearest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">approach to it is 'Truffier', which might be rendered 'Truffleman'. At first</p>

  <p class="calibre1">blush truffles do not suggest hypocrisy. Moliere's choice was brilliant. But why</p>

  <p class="calibre1">does it ring so true, and how did he arrive at it &gt;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Scholars have applied themselves to this problem, but with meager results.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">More than a century ago Francois Genin diverted into a fresh channel the flow</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of speculation on this subject. He announced that Moliere had not invented the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name, but had borrowed it ready-made from the Italians. He had discovered a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">line in the lengthy iyth century poem, <i class="calibre4">II Malmantik,</i> by Lorenzo Lippi, wherein</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one of the characters is called <i class="calibre4">il mal tartufo.</i> These words are to be found in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Canto xi, stanza 47. They refer to a dwarf, by name Batistone, whose behavior</p>

  <p class="calibre1">makes him ridiculous and gets him into trouble. However, whatever his faults,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the misshapen little man was no hypocrite and therefore no true precursor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Tartuffe. Moreover, Lippi's work came from the press only in 1676, seven</p>

  <p class="calibre1">years after <i class="calibre4">Tartujfe</i> was first presented on the stage, and we should have to assume</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that Moliere read it in manuscript, which he could have done but for which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there is no evidence. Genin made a virtue of this chronological difficulty, ob-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. For summaries of the discussions, see <i class="calibre4">Grand Dictionnaire Universe!</i> (Larousse) under 'Tartufe'; also the note</p>

  <p class="calibre1">serving that here was proof of Mohere's alertness to everything affecting his art!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Carrying Genin's line of inquiry further, Max J. Wolff in 1916 improved</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the citation in Lippi's poem.1 In a play by Giambattista della Porta, <i class="calibre4">L'Astro-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">logo,</i> dating from 1606, <i class="calibre4">tartufo</i> occurs in a curious context. One of the characters</p>

  <p class="calibre1">surfers from amnesia. In Act iv: 7 he is asked whether he is a horse, or an ox,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or an ass, and finally, " <i class="calibre4">Sei tu tartufo?",</i> to which the unhappy man replies,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"Sto fresco",</i> which is to say, "I'm in for it now." However, here again no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one knows what double meaning this <i class="calibre4">tartufo</i> conveyed to the early 17th century</p>

  <p class="calibre1">audience; but it was certainly unrelated to hypocrisy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Della Porta superseded Lippi in the quest for Tartuffe's progenitor, and recently</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rated against the warden of his church, Nicolas Vivian:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tu n'es qu'un tartuffe, qu'un butor, qu'une happelourde.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">You're nothing but a <i class="calibre4">tartuffe,</i> a lout, a paste-jewel.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Butor</i> means a bittern, but metaphorically it means a churl, lout, clodhopper,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">oaf, dolt. What did this angry priest mean by <i class="calibre4">tartuffe</i> 2 If <i class="calibre4">butor</i> was a synonym,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he meant what Lippi may have meant by <i class="calibre4">tartujo -</i> a dunce, with bad manners</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to boot. If <i class="calibre4">happelourde</i> developed the sense, then pretense and hypocrisy begin</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to appear. In Mohere's 'Tartuffe' there might be an echo of the colloquialism</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that survives for us in Antoine Fusy's diatribe. But Tartuffe was no dunce,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and anyway the question still stands for us: why should hypocrisy have attached</p>

  <p class="calibre1">itself to the truffle?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have pursued the thread of scholarly research from Genin to Wolff,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and from Wolff to Rebelliau, from Lippi to Della Porta to Fusy, from one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dubious clue to another. This evidence is relevant but secondary, and suggests</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a fallacious analogy with the philologist's quest for the etymon of a word. Surely</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the problem calls for different handling. We have to do with a creative mind in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the act of choosing a name for a great dramatic character.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But before we venture our own comments on the origins of 'Tartuffe' let</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us return for a moment to Genin. In the course of his discussion of Lippi's</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tartufo,</i> he suggested that the Italian word corresponded to the use of <i class="calibre4">fungus</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">as an epithet in ancient Rome. He recalled a character in a play by Plautus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who, when he discovered how he had been hoodwinked, exclaimed:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. See <i class="calibre4">Archiv fur das Studium der neueren Sprachen und Literaturen,</i> vol. 134, p. 148.</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_79">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Adeon' me fuisse fungum est qui illi crederem.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Was I such a fungus as to believe him!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">an exclamation that Genin rendered in French: Ai-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">je etc assez <i class="calibre4">cornichon . . .</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then Genin made a remarkable observation: for the Latin use <i class="calibre4">of fungus</i> as an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">epithet signifying stupidity, said he, the French substitute <i class="calibre4">cornichon, melon,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">citrouille —</i> names of gourds. Thus it comes about that Genin discovered a com-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mon denominator between fungi and gourds in their metaphorical use, and so</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he furnishes startling circumstantial evidence in support of our thesis, developed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on pages 127 ff., of a deepseated association in men's minds between gourds and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungi.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is another passage in Plautus that leaves no doubt as to the meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">of fungus</i> in contexts such as we are discussing. Act v of <i class="calibre4">Bacchides</i> opens with it,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nicobulus senex bursting upon the stage with these verses:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Quicumque ubi ubi sunt, qui fuerunt quique futuri sunt posthac</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stulti, stolidi, fatui, fungi, bardi, blenni, buccones,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">solus ego omnis longe antideo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stultitia et moribus indoctis.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of all the fools, chumps, dolts, <i class="calibre4">fungi,</i> oafs, drivelers, and mouth-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing idiots, wherever or whenever - single-handed I top the lot</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of them in folly and clumsy behavior!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Genin could have cited parallel examples in English - Shakespere's 'toadstool'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as an epithet, and Sir William Perm's 'mushroom'. We will go further and make</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bold to suggest that the perfect translation of <i class="calibre4">fungus</i> as Plautus used it is the col-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">loquial 'gump', a humble word that in a wide variety of forms circulates in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">England, Scotland, Ireland, and America. Its wide use and many forms testify</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to its long lineage. In Wright's <i class="calibre4">English Dialect Dictionary</i> we find gump(h),</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gomf, gamp, gamf, gaump, gawmp. We find also sumf and sumph. All these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">connote human stupidity. As we have seen, words etymologically identical to</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">fungus</i> are the Slavic <i class="calibre4">gamba,</i> German <i class="calibre4">Schwamm,</i> and the English 'swamp'; there</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is another cognate in English - 'sump', a water-filled trap or excavation. Are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not 'gump' and 'sumph' etymologically the progeny of the same verbal family?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Plautus' <i class="calibre4">Bacchides</i> are <i class="calibre4">not fungi</i> simple 'gumps'?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But however fascinating for mycophiles and ethno-mycologists these fungi</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Plautus and ancient Rome are, what have they to do with truffles, hypocrisy,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Tartuffe ? Was not Genin pursuing the wrong scent - barking up the tree</p>

  <p class="calibre1">180</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SECRETS OF THE TRUFFLE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where Sterne's Smelfungus grows, rather than grubbing for the habitat of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mohere's truffle?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The creative mind in literature is often made manifest in the selection of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">names for the characters. Dickens is famous for his names. Take Tulkinghorn</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in <i class="calibre4">Bleak House:</i> who has not had the misfortune of meeting his replica in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">legal profession? The syllables of that name, savored singly or together, suggest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by homonymic echo other words and ideas that become a harmonious composite</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the repugnant human being to whom Dickens introduces us. When Tristram</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Shandy's father sought out the treatises on 'long noses' that would help him in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coping with his infant's problem, Sterne characteristically devised names faintly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">smelling of his salacious theme: Prignitz, Scroderus, Parseus, not to speak of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Evening Conferences</i> of Bouchet - names of such subtle craftsmanship that only</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the attentive reader catches the message, and then only if he is already familiar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with Sterne's prurient nose. The art of devising names for fictitious characters</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lies in choosing sounds that suggest the sense without declaring it baldly, sounds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that reach out like antennae to catch meanings and emotional associations which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of themselves go far toward evoking the character whose acquaintance the reader</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is invited to make. Shakespere's Caliban and Ariel, by an alchemy of phonetic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and semantic echoes, offer in their names a foretaste of their roles, and those roles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in turn fulfill, richly amplify, and clinch the names, until names and character</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so thoroughly and unforgettably interpenetrate each other that they are one.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Moliere alone could tell us how he hit on 'Tartuffe', and he failed to do so.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This leaves the field open for others to suggest some of the associations that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must have lain in his mind, and in particular to explain how the idea of hypocrisy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">emerged from the truffle.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Truffles live out their lives in the dark, dank, cold underground, a fit habitat</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for repugnant things. The truffle of France is almost black, like the sombre</p>

  <p class="calibre1">habit and soul of Tartuffe. He was a lecher, and in the iyth century truffles were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the supreme aphrodisiac of France. The big, congested nose that we associate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with gluttony and wine-bibbing is today in France <i class="calibre4">une bonne truffe:</i> Tartuffe never</p>

  <p class="calibre1">missed a chance to gorge himself at others' tables. There may even have been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a Germanic influence in Tartuffe: the German name for the Devil, <i class="calibre4">der Teufel,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">gave to French the oath <i class="calibre4">tarteifle,</i> recorded in Larousse. If this was known in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Moliere's time, the phonetic echo would have been felicitous.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Underlying all these, however, was another idea - fraud. In Old French</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">truffe</i> and <i class="calibre4">truffer</i> meant 'fraud' and 'to defraud'. <i class="calibre4">Truffa</i> in Italian and <i class="calibre4">trufa</i> in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spanish signify 'swindle' to this day, and the parallel <i class="calibre4">truhdn,</i> meaning 'scoundrel',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has had a long and vigorous history in the Iberian peninsula. These various forms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">181</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_169"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_80">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">of the same word turned up in Middle English as the verb 'to truffle' and 'to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">trifle', as when one speaks of trifling with a girl's affections. In Scottish cant 'to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truff' has meant 'to befool' since before A.D. 1500, somewhat before the 'Auld</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alliance' with France. There is no evidence that Chaucer was conscious of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">existence of truffles, but he knew the word in its derived meaning, for in</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Canterbury Tales</i> his Parson defines the sin of idleness as:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the thurrok [i .e., bilge, or sump, or sink] of alle wikked and vileyns thoghtes,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and of alle jangles, trufles, and of all ordure, [line 715]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wherein jangles, trufles' mean idle chatter and deceits.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">All of those words stem back to the Low Latin <i class="calibre4">truffactor,</i> a swindler. There is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">also the Italian <i class="calibre4">truaare,</i> the French <i class="calibre4">troauer,</i> which give to English the verb</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'truck', meaning 'trade'. Equally striking is the Italian <i class="calibre4">trafficare,</i> the French</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">trajiquer.</i> The unpleasant flavor of these words survives in some contexts in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English 'traffic', but, as befits a nation of shopkeepers, with diminished intensity.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Traffic' and 'truck' are sometimes synonyms, as when the righteous man</p>

  <p class="calibre1">declares he will have no traffic (or truck) with yonder early prowling, base</p>

  <p class="calibre1">informing, sly, litigious, plaguy knave. The origin of <i class="calibre4">truccare</i> and <i class="calibre4">trafficare</i> has</p>

  <p class="calibre1">remained obscure. We suggest that they are related to <i class="calibre4">truffactor,</i> and that they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and <i class="calibre4">truffactor</i> itself are all secondary meanings originally derived from the Latin</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tuber, tufer,</i> the word for the truffle. The truffle-dealer was a notorious tradesman,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and he became a by-word. If we are right, the verbal progeny of the truffle,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the figurative sense, arrived in English in the I3th century, almost four</p>

  <p class="calibre1">centuries before the Englishman came to know the truffle that was the origin</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the word.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Oxford Dictionary in tracing the history of 'trifle' points out that some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">philologists have suggested an association with the truffle, but adds that no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one has ever proposed a semantic connection. We believe that we can supply</p>

  <p class="calibre1">such a connection. There is a reason why truffles are associated in some regions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with fraud to this day, and why 'truffle' at an early date became a colloquial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">metaphor signifying fraud. This reason is one that neither philologists nor pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fessional mycolo gists are best attuned to catch.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When truffles are for sale in the market places of the Mediterranean, <i class="calibre4">caveat</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">emptor!</i> The truffle dealer is even now a by-word among his fellows. He mixes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dirt with his truffles to add to their weight. He includes truffles in bad condition.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He sells inferior species for the best. He adds swarthy fungi that are not truffles.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Truffles, in short, are merchandise that lends itself to fraud. They call for unusual</p>

  <p class="calibre1">experience in the buyer who would avoid deception. In Adolphe Chatin's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">182</p>

  <p class="calibre1">THE SECRETS OF THE TRUFFLE</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">La Truffe,</i> already cited, the author devotes a whole chapter to frauds habitually</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perpetrated in the retailing of truffles. He reports that in the Dauphine, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Provence, and Perigord, where <i class="calibre4">triffe</i> means 'truffle', the ordinary locutions for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">calling a man a swindler are "Tes un trrrier" and "Tes un trurfaire". Every</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffle fancier teaches his disciples in the first lesson to be on their guard against</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these perils of the truffle traffic, lest haply they be (as one might say) trifled with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and <i class="calibre4">truffled.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">This proverbial dishonesty of the truffle merchant has escaped the notice of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the philologists who have wrestled with our cluster of words. It supplies the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">link that the Oxford Dictionary found wanting. It plumbs in depth, back through</p>

  <p class="calibre1">centuries, the mores of the small-town market-places of Italy, the Provence,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Spain. It supplies the background of double-dealing that appealed to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Moliere when he hit on the doublet 'Tartuffe' for the name of his character.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To have used 'Truffe' or 'Truffier' would have been crudely blunt and a flaw.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Italian <i class="calibre4">tartufo</i> never took to itself the secondary meaning of fraud. By</p>

  <p class="calibre1">resorting to it Moliere was achieving his purpose - hitting on a name that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evoked a penumbra of subtle associations, none obvious but all of them of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kind to conjure up the villainy of his hero; associations that are felt rather</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than thought out, a <i class="calibre4">parfum</i> so elusive that it works its influence and passes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">undetected. All words are enveloped in such a penumbra, which no lexicogra-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pher can pin down, and the essence of great writing is the art of utilizing to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the full these emanations, which after all express the most intimate emotions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of men in communion with one another.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In 1836 there appeared in Paris a book entitled <i class="calibre4">De la Truffe,</i> the authorship</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of which is attributed on the title page to 'MM. Moynier', about whose identity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we have discovered nothing further. Early in that book the reader is told how</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Moliere came to choose the name 'Tartuffe'. The episode is believable and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rings true, but there is no way to verify it. All of the influences and 'sources'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that scholars laboriously unravel and dissect and ticket are here synthesized</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for Moliere in a flash, and the <i class="calibre4">tuber</i> of the Romans, the <i class="calibre4">turma</i> of the Spaniards, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">trujfe</i> of the French rises from the crucible of the playwright's mind sublimated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and transfigured, imbued as by magic with the immortal attributes of Tartuffe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For Moliere's Tartuffe possesses an eternal vitality, of an order far different from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and superior to that other tawdry lure of eternal youth which spurred on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ponce de Leon and his companions, beguiled as they were by childish illusions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about <i class="calibre4">batatas</i> and miraculous fountains, doomed as they were in this world,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like Tantalus in another, to an endless round of recurring hope and recurring</p>

  <p class="calibre1">frustration.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here then is the genesis of 'Tartuffe', as related by MM. Moynier: The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">authors begin by informing their readers that the story is told to them by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Superior of a congregation of Capuchin friars who in 1826 were still</p>

  <p class="calibre1">living in Aix-en-Provence. The Father Superior explains that from earliest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">days the truffle was known to the members of his order, and also its renown as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">an aphrodisiac. In the course of time, he says, it came about that on a particular</p>

  <p class="calibre1">occasion Moliere was observing one of the worthy fathers consuming some</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffles. Moliere was struck by the rotundity of the friar's face and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vermillion coloring of his cheeks, as he sat there ingesting the truffles at his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">superior's board. He was swathed and muffled in an enormous woollen</p>

  <p class="calibre1">habit, and the garment even seemed to envelop a goodly part of the table over</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which he was hunched. He was a picture of deep meditation. As he savored his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffles, the holy man appeared to be either in a state of ecstatic contemplation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">before a vision of the Blessed Virgin, or else relishing in deep, long draughts</p>

  <p class="calibre1">certain intimate internal pleasures artfully contrived. "What do you call this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thing ?", said Moliere to him. "A truffle, my dear Sir," replied the contemplative.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then said Moliere to himself: " Of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">truffe</i>&nbsp;I shall make Tartuffe, and thou, poor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fellow, shalt be he."</p>
