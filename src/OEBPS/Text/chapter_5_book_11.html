            <p><span class="initial">I</span>t might seem that by now we had exhausted the erotic imagery of the fungal world, wherein fire, mucus, noses, candles, and mushrooms dance together in a throbbing surrealist fandango, the whole obscene performance conducted inside the uterine envelope of the primeval&nbsp;<i>gamba.</i>&nbsp;But not so. We have yet to speak of truffles.</p>

        <p>The Greeks used various words for underground fungi, but we think we can prove that the ύδνον was our truffle. In the Morgan codex of Dioscorides there is a miniature accompanying the section on the ύδνον that gives us our earliest pictorial representation of a&nbsp;<i>tuber</i>&nbsp;buried in the earth, and an excellent representation it is.</p>

        <p>The truffle in Latin was the&nbsp;<i>tuber,</i>&nbsp;which took the form of&nbsp;<i>tufer</i>&nbsp;in an Oscan or Umbrian dialect. The Romans knew various kinds of&nbsp;<i>tuber.</i>&nbsp;The most esteemed were from Africa, and were probably not true truffles but an underground fungus known to science today by the name of terfezia. From the Latin word came the French&nbsp;<i>truffe,</i>&nbsp;the Spanish&nbsp;<i>trufa,</i>&nbsp;and the English &lsquo;truffle&rsquo;. From a form supposed to have been&nbsp;<i>terrae tufer</i>&nbsp;the Italians arrived at the modern&nbsp;<i>tartufo</i>&nbsp;and a diminutive&nbsp;<i>tartuffola.</i>&nbsp;The surprising thing is that this last word turns up in German as the name for the potato,&nbsp;<i>Kartoffel,</i>&nbsp;and from there spread eastward throughout the Slavic lands, until today half of Europe calls the potato by the word that originally meant &lsquo;truffle&rsquo;! In our view the explanation for this curious transfer of meaning lies in the preoccupation with aphrodisiacs of 16<sup>th</sup> century Europe.</p>

 <p>When Ponce de Leon embarked on his quest for the Fountain of Youth, he was bent on discovering a sensational aphrodisiac of lasting virtue. What a prize would be his if he could present to the Old World a miraculous bath to supersede all the amatory prescriptions in traditional use! Among those traditional inciters to venery none enjoyed higher esteem than truffles, and indeed this reputation of theirs survives into our own times. No pages in Brillant-Savarin&rsquo;s <i>Physiologic du Gout</i>&nbsp;are more delightful than those devoted to a judicial weighing of the evidence in this matter of truffles and love. There are many kinds of subterranean fungi, of which some are entitled to be called truffles; and of these true truffles, a few species are esteemed by gourmets. In Spanish,&nbsp;<i>trufa</i>&nbsp;is the name given to a truffle of high culinary worth. There are two other terms used generally for the underground fungi:&nbsp;<i>turma</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>criadilla de tierra.</i>&nbsp;These are both interesting, expressing as they do the aphrodisiacal virtue attributed to the whole tribe of underground fungi.&nbsp;<i>Turma</i>&nbsp;in Catalan means &lsquo;testicle&rsquo;, and in Spanish it means both &lsquo;testicle&rsquo; and &lsquo;truffle&rsquo;. It is an old word, probably of pre-Roman origin, coming down from the same Indo-European root &lsquo;tu&rsquo; that gives to Latin <i>tuber</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>tumor,</i>&nbsp;the idea of organic swelling being inherent in them all[1]. <i>Criadilla</i>&nbsp;is the standard word in Spanish for &lsquo;testicle&rsquo;. It is the word used for lamb&rsquo;s fries, the French&nbsp;<i>amourette.</i>&nbsp;The Spaniards&rsquo; words for the truffle reveal the precious virtue that these earthy growths were supposed to possess.</p>

 <p>Immediately after the Spaniards fell on America in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, they discovered in the New World first the sweet potato1 and then the potato, the <i>batata</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>papa.</i>&nbsp;They found the&nbsp;<i>batata</i>&nbsp;in the Antilles, probably in Hispa- niola: the word first appears in 1516, a borrowing from the Taino Indians who were then living in the Greater Antilles and Bahamas. (Their name should he pronounced in three syllables, as though written &lsquo;Taino&rsquo;.) The Tainos deserved a kinder fate than was theirs: they and their language are now dead these many generations, and few today know even the tribal name of these first victims of the invaders from Europe. The Tainos possessed a tongue belonging to the Arawakan family of Indian languages, which were spoken by tribes scattered at the time of the Conquest all the way from Florida and the Bahamas on the north through the Greater Antilles and across the tropical belt of South America as far south as what is now known as Matto Grosso. These Tainos of the Islands were a gentle folk: they seemed to lend verisimilitude to the medieval dreams of a Golden Age, and gave impetus to the notion of the Noble Savage that was destined to captivate intelligent men in the Age of Reason. The blameless Taino cultivated sweet potatoes and maize, smoked tobacco, slept in a hammock, and plied the sea ways in long &lsquo;canoas&rsquo;. The Spaniards remarked on the uniformity of the Taino language throughout the various Islands &mdash; clearly in the Taino world the sea was a highway to speed communications and not an insulating barrier. Today even scholars often confuse the winsome Tainos with their ferocious enemies, known variously in the idth century as the Caribs or Calibs or Canibs, a race of savage warriors who when the Spaniards arrived had already seized the Lesser Antilles and were harassing the Tainos on the larger islands. The Europeans quickly overwhelmed them both. But all unawares, by a natural filtering of the Indian vocabularies, the world distinguishes to this day between these two lost and almost forgotten peoples. From the language of the Tainos we possess a legacy of five common and friendly words: potato, maize, tobacco, hammock, and canoe. From the Canibs came our &lsquo;cannibals&rsquo;, and the bestial Caliban whom Shakespere placed in the still-vex&rsquo;d Bermoothes was the literary scion of the Calibs.</p>

 <p>The Tainos certainly did not attribute aphrodisiacal powers to the <i>batata</i> or sweet potato. They could not have been under illusions about this humble vegetable, so commonplace for them. But the Spaniards, obsessed by the idea of aphrodisiacs, were quick to discover in the <i>batata</i> a new and more potent truffle. (Were they under a temptation to hold the novel food to blame for their excesses with the native womenfolk?) A few years later they discovered the white potato in the Andean highlands, the <i>papa</i> as it was called in Quechua, the language of the Inca and his people. Now the story repeats itself: Agustin de Zarate, in his classic account of the conquest of Peru, published in 1555, informs his readers that the white potato is like the <i>turma de tierra,</i> &lsquo;earth&rsquo;s testicle&rsquo;, the truffle of precious virtue:</p>

 <blockquote>
     <p>&hellip;y los indios comen unas rakes que llaman <i>papas,</i> que son de hechura y aun casi sabor de turmas de tierra. . . [BOOK, in, Chap. 12]</p>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>This work was promptly translated by Thomas Nicholas and published in London in 1581. Since truffles were unknown to the English, we were eager to see how the excellent Nicholas met his difficulty in rendering the sentence where they are mentioned:</p>

 <blockquote>
     <p>&hellip;The Indians of this province eateth certaine Rootes called <i>Papas,</i> whiche are verie like bothe in makynge and taste Turnepes.</p>
 </blockquote>

 <p>How the humble turnip is here exalted, and the truffle humbled! Were truffles ever so grossly maligned before or since?</p>

 <p>Shortly after the batata, the Spaniards brought back from the New World the white potato, and from Spain it reached Italy before 1588, where it was called <i>taratouffli,</i> the Italian word for &lsquo;truffles&rsquo;, a translation of the Spanish name but without the strong erotic association of <i>turmas.</i> Quickly thereafter it appeared in the Low Countries, Switzerland, and Germany, and then in France. It arrived in England after the sweet potato but before the end of the century. The two vegetables became deeply entangled in verbal confusion. In Spanish-speaking America the white potato is widely known to this day as the <i>papa,</i> a name clothed with all the rights of chronological and topographical primacy. But this word took no hold in Europe and batata served for both vegetables, finally in England attaching itself for good to the wrong plant. The Spaniards compounded the confusion by also bestowing on the new vegetables their own name for truffles. To this day in some parts of Colombia potatoes are <i>turmas</i> or &lsquo;testicles&rsquo;, and in Spain they were known as <i>criadillas</i> and <i>trufas.</i> In the dialect of Aragon <i>trufa</i> has been reported in the form <i>triunfa -</i> a popular malformation that suggests the amorous triumph assured to the hopeful consumer <i>of criadillas.[2]</i>

     <p>For a time potatoes remained a rarity, priced high in keeping with the virtue attributed to them. Their appearance in England points up a curious cultural phenomenon. Reaching England by way of Spain, both kinds of potatoes while in transit assumed like changelings the amatory reputation of the truffle. Thus it came about that England took delivery of America&rsquo;s gifts with a Spanish billing, never suspecting that the humble vegetables from the New World were now sailing on a false invoice, their genuine virtues lost from view in the resplendent aura befitting a newly discovered and miraculous aphrodisiac.</p>

     <p>The craze for aphrodisiacs seized England too. Falstaff in <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> invokes them. "Let the skie raine Potatoes", he exclaims, and "haile kissing-Comfits, and snow Eringoes", these latter being the candied root of the sea-holly, known to science as the eryngium maritimum. Caviar in Elizabethan times was yet another erotic stimulant, as Sir John Harington, godson of the Queen, reminds us in his unabashed epigram &lsquo;Against an Old Letcher&rsquo;:</p>

     <blockquote>
         <p> Since thy third cariage of the French infection<br/>
             Priapus hath in thee found no erection: Yet eatst<br/>
             thou Ringoes, and potato Rootes, And Gaueare<br/>
             [caviar], but it litle bootes. Besides at thy beds-heads&rsquo;,<br/>
             a bottle lately found, Of Liquor that a<br/>
             quart cost twenty pound.</p>
         <p>For shame, if not more grace, yet shew more wit,<br/>
             Surcease, now sinne leaues thee, to follow it. Some<br/>
             smile, I sigh, to see they madness such That that<br/>
             which stands not stands thee in so much.</p>
     </blockquote>
     
     <p>Those &lsquo;potatoes&rsquo; in Shakespere were certainly sweet potatoes; in Harington, we are not sure.</p>

     <p>For almost a thousand years after the fall of Rome, there seems to be no mention of truffles in surviving documents.[3] In the 13<sup>th</sup> century Albertus Magnus speaks of them in <i>De Vegetabilibus</i>, but hesitantly and vaguely, and without reference to aphrodisiacal properties. This vagueness seems not to have been accidental. In the <i>Hortus Sanitatis,</i> printed in Mainz in 1491, the artist who made the woodcuts showed more courage than discretion when he illustrated the section on the <i>tuber.</i> Never has there been a more grievous misrepresentation of a fungus. We know not whether Albertus Magnus and he had never seen a truffle, or whether, knowing truffles, they failed to identify them with the Latin <i>tuber.</i> In the earliest of printed cookbooks, <i>De Honesta Voluptate,</i> published in Rome in the middle 1470&rsquo;s and attributed to Bartolomeo de&rsquo; Sacchi called Platina, there is a short section on truffles. The author speaks of those that come from Africa and the Near East, and then he refers to the species that sensual men of fashion consume to whet their appetite for love-making. With an amusing lack of humor he goes on to observe that if this is done for procreation, it is praiseworthy, but if for debauchery, as is the case (he says) with many idle and intemperate persons, it is to be altogether despised. No trace of scepticism diluted the faith of this author in the peculiar virtue attributed to truffles. Doubtless there are earlier references to these as aphrodisiacs, but we have not come upon them.</p>

     <p>By the 16<sup>th</sup> century the fashion for truffles was at its height. They reached this peak of esteem at the moment when potatoes arrived from the Andes, via Spain. The two were confused in Spain, as we have seen, and it is hardly surprising to find that they came to be confused in France, Italy, and Germany. <i>Tartufi bianchi</i> has been an alternative designation for potatoes in Italy down to recent times, a use of <i>tartufo</i> that is facilitated by the supremacy in Italy of a white truffle, the tuber magnatum. This is the truffle that in Italian restaurants is com- monly served raw, in thinnest slices. It suggests the flavor of garlic, but unlike garlic does not repeat itself. Across the Alps in the Dauphine, the peasants in their patois have been reported in modern times as using the term <i>triffe niere</i> to designate both the truffle and a kind of potato with a purplish flesh.[4] In Germany there is a common fungus, with white flesh, about five inches in diameter, that grows either half-buried or just under the ground in oak forests. It is aromatic and edible, and mycologists know it as the choiromyces meandriformis &mdash; the meandering pig-fungus. It looks like a potato, and the initial confusion between the familiar fungus and the novel potato must have contributed to the permanent hold of the word <i>Kartoffel</i> in Germany, whence it spread with the potato in due course to Scandinavia and the Slavic lands. In turn the Russians carried the word across Siberia and to the Eskimos of Alaska, where in various dialects of the Eskimo language we find the potato of the Andes called by names that reach straight back to the <i>tuber</i> of Pliny: <i>kaltu:jilaq</i> and <i>kaltu:Jaq</i> and <i>kaltuvaq</i> and <i>kaltu:xaq?</i>[5]</p>

     <p>That initial confusion of potatoes with truffles which began in Spain in Renaissance times has never completely died. Van Sterbeeck surprises and amuses the modern reader when in his <i>Theatrum Fungorum,</i> a work exclusively dealing with fungi published in 1675, he devotes a section to potatoes and other members of the nightshade family! If the reader will examine again the frontispiece to Van Sterbeeck&rsquo;s book, which we reproduce on Plate XXVIII, he will discover among all the mushrooms one basket that is spilling potatoes on the ground. In Russia down into the present century the Old Believers of the Moscow region were still rejecting potatoes, which they would spurn as <i>sobach&rsquo;i mude,</i> dog&rsquo;s testicles; this was recorded in 1915 by Roman Jakobson in the neighborhood of Vereja. We discover the same associations lingering on in certain metaphors current in Spanish America, but here we arrive at the inner meaning only by a series of transitions. The Spaniards thought truffles were aphrodisiacs, and they considered sweet potatoes, the <i>batatas</i> of the Antilles, a superior truffle. The word <i>batata</i> never spread much on the American mainland, where sweet potatoes came to be called <i>camotes,</i> the name for the vegetable in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. Today in many parts of Spanish-speaking America <i>camote</i> is a metaphor used for &lsquo;being in love&rsquo;. It also means a lie or exaggeration, and thus recalls the disillusion of those who relied on the virtue attributed to the sweet potato.[6] Finally, the old error, fossilized, persists to this day in circles where one might least expect it: botanists and mycologists use the word &lsquo;tuber&rsquo; for both potatoes and truffles, thus embalming in their unhappy nomenclature the hoary blunder.</p>

     <p>There is a tradition that the vogue of the truffle in France and Italy came from Spain during the Renaissance, and that it attained its exalted place on the tables of the mighty in the reign of Francois I. It certainly soared to new renown in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, but the survival in France and Italy of the local names derived from the Latin <i>tuber</i> is evidence that on humbler and less articulate levels the truffle had not been wholly forgotten in the silent centuries reaching back to Roman times. In Paris, however, the truffle was adorning only the most aristocratic tables down almost to the French Revolution, Brillat-Savarin asserts that the</p>

     <blockquote>
         <p>revival of the truffle is quite recent&hellip; One can even say that the present generation has almost witnessed it. Toward 1780 truffles were rare in Paris, to be found, and then in small quantities, only at the Hotel des Americains and the Hotel de la Provence. A turkey stuffed with truffles was a luxury to be found only on the tables of the great, or in the homes of kept women &hellip; At the moment when I write these lines [1825] one can say that the glory of the truffle has reached its apogee.</p>
     </blockquote>

     <p>With the rise of the bourgeoisie following the French Revolution, new layers of society acquired a taste for the delicacy and by their demand for it brought about an immense increase in the harvest. In the 16<sup>th</sup> century various kinds of truffles had competed for favor in France, but by Brillat-Savarin&rsquo;s time the tuber melanosporum of Perigord had established its primacy and become perhaps the supreme delight of the haute cuisine. Meanwhile that other tuber, the potato, thanks to the ingenious and bold promotion of the famous Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, had finally, in the lyyo&rsquo;s, gained acceptance as a worthy food for a gentleman&rsquo;s table in France.</p>

     <p>The reputation of the truffle as an erotic stimulant has an elusive history. This reputation was certainly endemic in Spain, expressing itself as it did in the names <i>criadilla</i> and <i>turma.</i> The culture of the Iberian peninsula is strong in archaic traits, and this would suggest that the peculiar repute of the truffle goes back far. We have not arrived at the indigenous names for the truffle in the other Indo-European languages, such as those of India. In the Sind, as an example, there is a fungus that in Sindhi is called <i>saitan jo pelo,</i> Satan&rsquo;s testicles. But we know not its identity: is it a truffle?</p>

     <p>Perhaps the Spaniards in their century of great influence were responsible for spreading the belief that truffles were aphrodisiacs. This is a tempting hypothesis. Yet there is certain subtle evidence suggesting that an indigenous tradition of the same kind prevailed in Central Europe, notably in Germany and Bohemia.</p>

 <p>For centuries the hunting of the stag in Europe was the noblest expression of the chase. This stag was the male of the red deer. Norman Douglas in <i>Paneros</i> has pointed out that the genitalia of the stag were coveted as precious inciters to venery. Now here is an interesting fact that Douglas did not know: there exists an underground fungus distinct from the truffle that is called in German the <i>Hirschtruffel -</i> the stag&rsquo;s truffles. In English botanical works already a century ago it was called &lsquo;hart&rsquo;s truffle&rsquo;, and also &lsquo;hart&rsquo;s balls&rsquo; and &lsquo;deer balls&rsquo;. The corresponding names in French and Spanish are <i>truffe du cerfznd criadilla de ciervo.</i> We have no evidence that these words circulated outside the covers of books: they could be bookish renderings of the German term. One should look for such terms in the vocabulary peculiar to traffickers in aphrodisiacs and their clientele, and source materials for this dubious area of cultural activity have eluded us. We suspect that our hart&rsquo;s truffles would be found therein. The scientist&rsquo;s name for this genus of fungus is a scientist&rsquo;s neo-Greek rendering of the German name: elaphomyces.</p>

 <p>As to the ripe age of the German name there can be no doubt. Before 1544 Valerius Cordus, in his <i>Adnotationes,</i> commented most curiously on the stag&rsquo;s truffle. Truffles were thought to be earth&rsquo;s testicles and aphrodisiacs, and the stag&rsquo;s testicles were also aphrodisiacs. From this it was only a step to suppose that the underground fungi were generated from the spilled seed of stags! Here is a pretty illustration of the way men&rsquo;s minds work by false analogies, taking figures of speech literally. But this is not all. Why were these underground fungi related to the genitalia of stags and no other animals &gt; We believe that beneath the surface of the words of Valerius Cordus we detect a further punning analogy, a foolish confusion caused by homonyms, and yet a confusion possessing a certain extraordinary iridescence.</p>

 <p>There are two words spelled Venery&rsquo; in English. One of them is derived from &lsquo;Venus&rsquo; and means sexual lust. The other is derived from the Latin <i>venari,</i> meaning &lsquo;to hunt&rsquo;. In sound these two words run parallel to each other through-out the Romance languages and medieval Latin. Indeed, when we go back behind Latin, we discover that both words, Venus and <i>venari,</i> descend from the same root, a root cousin to the English verb &lsquo;to win&rsquo;. He who pursues and brings down the game is engaged in the same order of activity as he who brings down a mate. &lsquo;Venery&rsquo; in its application to the chase relates to the noblest kind of hunting, the coursing of the stag. And this leads us to suggest the play on words that probably explains the kinship of truffles to stags. The aphrodisiacal truffles in the earth are earth&rsquo;s testicles, fruit of the stag&rsquo;s truffles, and both are shot through with venery. Venery in both senses loomed large in the consciousness of the 16th century European. We suggest that this common denominator of the homonyms, albeit unexpressed in the text of Valerius Cordus, was in the back of his mind, consciously or unconsciously, as he wrote out his quaint observations about hart&rsquo;s truffles:</p>

 <blockquote>
     <p> Pharmacopolse etiam in suis OfEcinis Fungos habent, quos Boletos et Fungos ceruinos vocant. Ferunt eos in sylvis ex semine cervorum enasci, et propterea Venerem stimulare: sed falsum hoc est. Inueni enim hos Ceruinos fungos in prseruptissimis montium syluis, quo ne Damae et Rupicaprse quidem peruenire possent, nedum cerui. Nee verisimile est eos venerem stimulare, cum frigidum, pituitosum, crudum, et malignum succum in humane corpore gignant. Quae enim Venerem accendere debent, contrarias facultates et qualitates habere necesse est. Apothecaries, in fact, have in their establishments fungi which they call boleti and stag fungi. They say that these originate in the woods from the seed of stags, and hence excite the sexual impulse; but this is false. For I have found these stag fungi in the densest mountain groves, which not even fallow deer and chamois could reach, not to mention stags. Nor is it likely that they excite the sexual urge, as they engender cold, phlegmy, raw, and evil humor in the human body. Things that are to inflame the sexual impulses must have opposite faculties and characteristics.</p>

  <p>Cordus, who was German, was writing this passage shortly before 1544, the year of his premature death. His text does not suggest that the lust-inciting virtue attributed to the fungi was a novelty for him, nor foreign in inspiration. He was clearly challenging a tradition native to his German world. But Cordus, steeped from his earliest years in the New Learning, was far removed from the well-springs of the primitive beliefs of his race. Perhaps he was revealing the innocence that often goes with education when he labored his point about the stags in the mountain groves. Did not the erotic names for the truffles refer rather to the Horned God of the pagan world? In 1920 the Abbe Breuil and Count Begouen published[7] a prehistoric design that they had discovered engraved on the walls in the innermost recess of the Caverne des Trois Freres, at Montesquieu-Avantes, Ariege. It represented a man costumed for a primitive religious rite. On his head he wore antlers. The upper part of his face was owlish, the lower part covered by a long beard. The skin of a wild beast, perhaps a stag, is swung over his body. His hands are in a clawing posture. A horse&rsquo;s tail protrudes from the rear. He could easily be the remote progenitor of the Robin Goodfellow illustrated on page 83. The ancient artist leaves the beholder in no doubt concerning the importance that he attributes to <i>las criadillas de ciervo,</i> the hart&rsquo;s truffles. By this interpretation the aphrodisiacal metaphor suddenly takes on a pulsating vitality, and the two meanings of &lsquo;venery&rsquo; coalesce. The horns of Robin Goodfellow and of the god of the prehistoric cave also appear in a new light. Our ancestors never tired of their jokes about the cuckold&rsquo;s horns &mdash; the symbols of his humiliation. R. Lowe Thompson in his <i>History</i> <i>of the Devil,</i> published in New York in 1929, suggested that originally these horns were the horns of the &lsquo;Satan&rsquo; who ofEciated at the rites of the witches&rsquo; coven. Certainly this interpretation quickens a stale figure of speech, and gives added piquancy to the priapism of Robin Goodfellow.</p>

  <p>We might now call a halt to our discussion of fungal aphrodisiacs, were it not for a singular phenomenon that we discover in the Czech language. Alone among the Slavs, the Czechs pay attention, by native tradition, to the world of truffles. For the underground fungi they possess two words, both native. The true truffle is <i>lanyz,</i> and the hart&rsquo;s truffle is <i>thejelenka.</i> The name of the true truffle comes from <i>Ian,</i> the word that designates the roe or hind of the red deer. The name of the hart&rsquo;s truffle comes <i>faomjelen,</i> which designates the stag. A peculiar aspect of these words is the shift in genders that takes place:</p>

  <table>
      <tr>
          <td>MASCULINE</td>
          <td>FEMININE</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><i>jelen</i> (stag)</td>
          <td><i>Ian</i> (hind)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><i>lanyz</i> (true or hind&rsquo;s truffle)</td>
          <td><i>jelenka</i> (hart&rsquo;s truffle)</td>
      </tr>
  </table>

 <p>What lies behind this criss-crossing of genders? In some medieval Czech text someone may discover the answer, perhaps in a manuscript dealing with love philtres. Meanwhile we suggest as a working hypothesis that the hart&rsquo;s truffle, <i>jelenka,</i> was prescribed for women, and the hind&rsquo;s truffle, <i>lanyz,</i> for men. In addition to the hart&rsquo;s truffle, <i>jelenka</i> is the Czech name for the mushroom known as the phallus impudicus, and a related name, <i>jelenice,</i> is used for the hydnum imbricatum, a species that by its shape is also erotically suggestive.</p>

 <p>The <i>Czech jelenka</i> in its fungal application is semantically and mycologically a precise equivalent of the German <i>Hirschbrunst,</i> &lsquo;hart&rsquo;s rut&rsquo;, showing that Czechs and Germans shared a faith in the aphrodisiacal virtues of the phallus impudicus <i>(Hirschbrunst iiber der Erde)</i> and the hart&rsquo;s truffles <i>(Hirschbrunst unter der Erde).</i> J. G. Gleditsch in his <i>Methodus Fungorum</i> (1753) wrote condescendingly of the Moravian peasant girls who used certain dried phalloidaceae to cure warts and corns, according to him without success; and how these fungi, air-dried or smoked, were thought to stimulate venery in dogs and horses. He added that rustics used them even on themselves. Mrs. Ulehlova-Tilschova in her book on Czech folk food, <i>Ceska strava lidovd,</i> has lately reported an East Moravian name for true truffles, <i>barant vajca,</i> &lsquo;lamb&rsquo;s fries&rsquo; or testicles.[8] Later in the same work she calls attention to the important role played by fungi in the ritual dinner on Christmas eve in Bohemia, when the mushrooms are served in a soup or as gravy or mixed with cereal. The precise meaning of the mushrooms consumed on this annual occasion survives in men&rsquo;s memories in southern Bohemia, near Tabor, where the mushrooms are served with millet and the dish is called <i>kuba</i> or <i>manas.</i> The word <i>ntanas</i> means a lusty male, and he who eats of the dish is imbued with extra virility for the coming year.</p>

 <p>John Parkinson, obviously relying on Central European sources, published in his <i>Theatrum Botanicum[9]</i> in 1640 certain curious facts about the use of hart&rsquo;s truffles or elaphomyces as aphrodisiacs and in medication:</p>

 <blockquote>
     <p>These be not eaten in the same manner as the former [true truffles], that is for meate or food, but as a medicament being cut into peeces, and dryed upon strings put through them to be used upon occasion: while they are fresh they have a strong and evill sent, which they lose in the drying, and are used either alone one dramme and a halfe in pouther, taken with sweete wine or with other things as provoke venery, as also to increase milke in Nourses breasts, taken in some ptisane drinke, and a little long pepper added thereto: the smoake thereof when it is burned taken underneath, helpeth women troubled with the mother, and openeth the passages when they are close: they are thought also to expell poyson, and the venome of creatures, to be taken in pure wine, and also applyed outwardly.</p>
 </blockquote>

  <p>Both Gleditsch and Parkinson were unfriendly informants repeating hearsay. Mrs. Ulehlova-Tilschova, centuries later, is at last tapping the genuine sources of folk beliefs, of which many in the intervening generations must have vanished forever. In low English the word &lsquo;hart&rsquo; preserves to this day an erotic sense, unrecorded in the dictionaries.</p>

 <p>Here our story of the truffle would end, had not Moliere by a stroke of genius created the character of Tartuffe. By the criterion of price, by the prestige of its <i>parfum,</i> by its erotic associations, the truffle holds a position of primacy in the fungal world. To all these distinctions it adds literary immortality: in Tartuffe hypocrisy finds its supreme artistic incarnation. In Tartuffe&rsquo;s fungal name the truffle was woven into the very warp and woof of Europe&rsquo;s cultural tapestry.</p>

 <p>What led Moliere to &lsquo;Tartuffe&rsquo;? This is not a French family name: the nearest approach to it is &lsquo;Truffier&rsquo;, which might be rendered &lsquo;Truffleman&rsquo;. At first blush truffles do not suggest hypocrisy. Moliere&rsquo;s choice was brilliant. But why does it ring so true, and how did he arrive at it?</p>

 <p>Scholars have applied themselves to this problem, but with meager results.[9] More than a century ago Francois Genin diverted into a fresh channel the flow of speculation on this subject. He announced that Moliere had not invented the name, but had borrowed it ready-made from the Italians. He had discovered a line in the lengthy iyth century poem, <i>II Malmantik,</i> by Lorenzo Lippi, wherein one of the characters is called <i>il mal tartufo.</i> These words are to be found in Canto xi, stanza 47. They refer to a dwarf, by name Batistone, whose behavior makes him ridiculous and gets him into trouble. However, whatever his faults, the misshapen little man was no hypocrite and therefore no true precursor of Tartuffe. Moreover, Lippi&rsquo;s work came from the press only in 1676, seven years after <i>Tartujfe</i> was first presented on the stage, and we should have to assume that Moliere read it in manuscript, which he could have done but for which there is no evidence. Genin made a virtue of this chronological difficulty, observing that here was proof of Mohere&rsquo;s alertness to everything affecting his art!</p>

 <p>Carrying Genin&rsquo;s line of inquiry further, Max J. Wolff in 1916 improved on the citation in Lippi&rsquo;s poem.[10] In a play by Giambattista della Porta, <i>L&rsquo;Astro-</i> <i>logo,</i> dating from 1606, <i>tartufo</i> occurs in a curious context. One of the characters surfers from amnesia. In Act iv: 7 he is asked whether he is a horse, or an ox, or an ass, and finally, " <i>Sei tu tartufo?",</i> to which the unhappy man replies, <i>"Sto fresco",</i> which is to say, "I&rsquo;m in for it now." However, here again no one knows what double meaning this <i>tartufo</i> conveyed to the early 17<sup>th</sup> century audience; but it was certainly unrelated to hypocrisy.</p>

 <p>Della Porta superseded Lippi in the quest for Tartuffe&rsquo;s progenitor, and recently Della Porta in his turn has had to give way before a fresh find. Our contemporary scholar Alfred Rebelliau has drawn attention to a pamphlet published in 1609 entitled <i>Le Mastigophore auauel Tout brisees les brides a veaux de maistre Ivvain</i> <i>Solanicqiie,</i> written by Antoine Fusy, a parish priest of Paris. In it he vituperated against the warden of his church, Nicolas Vivian:</p>

 <blockquote>
     <p>Tu n&rsquo;es qu&rsquo;un tartuffe, qu&rsquo;un butor, qu&rsquo;une happelourde.<br/>
         You&rsquo;re nothing but a <i>tartuffe,</i> a lout, a paste-jewel.</p>
 </blockquote>

 <p><i>Butor</i> means a bittern, but metaphorically it means a churl, lout, clodhopper, oaf, dolt. What did this angry priest mean by <i>tartuffe</i> 2 If <i>butor</i> was a synonym, he meant what Lippi may have meant by <i>tartujo -</i> a dunce, with bad manners to boot. If <i>happelourde</i> developed the sense, then pretense and hypocrisy begin to appear. In Mohere&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tartuffe&rsquo; there might be an echo of the colloquialism that survives for us in Antoine Fusy&rsquo;s diatribe. But Tartuffe was no dunce, and anyway the question still stands for us: why should hypocrisy have attached itself to the truffle?</p>

 <p>We have pursued the thread of scholarly research from Genin to Wolff, and from Wolff to Rebelliau, from Lippi to Della Porta to Fusy, from one dubious clue to another. This evidence is relevant but secondary, and suggests a fallacious analogy with the philologist&rsquo;s quest for the etymon of a word. Surely the problem calls for different handling. We have to do with a creative mind in the act of choosing a name for a great dramatic character.</p>

 <p>But before we venture our own comments on the origins of &lsquo;Tartuffe&rsquo; let us return for a moment to Genin. In the course of his discussion of Lippi&rsquo;s <i>tartufo,</i> he suggested that the Italian word corresponded to the use of <i>fungus</i> as an epithet in ancient Rome. He recalled a character in a play by Plautus who, when he discovered how he had been hoodwinked, exclaimed:</p>

 <blockquote>
     <p>Adeon&rsquo; me fuisse fungum est qui illi crederem.<br/>
         Was I such a fungus as to believe him!</p>
 </blockquote>

 <p>an exclamation that Genin rendered in French: Ai-</p>

 <blockquote>
     <p>je etc assez <i>cornichon &hellip;</i></p>
 </blockquote>

 <p>Then Genin made a remarkable observation: for the Latin use <i>of fungus</i> as an epithet signifying stupidity, said he, the French substitute <i>cornichon, melon,</i> <i>citrouille —</i> names of gourds. Thus it comes about that Genin discovered a common denominator between fungi and gourds in their metaphorical use, and so he furnishes startling circumstantial evidence in support of our thesis, developed on pages 127 ff., of a deepseated association in men&rsquo;s minds between gourds and fungi.</p>

 <p>There is another passage in Plautus that leaves no doubt as to the meaning <i>of fungus</i> in contexts such as we are discussing. Act v of <i>Bacchides</i> opens with it, Nicobulus senex bursting upon the stage with these verses:</p>

 <blockquote>
     <p>Quicumque ubi ubi sunt, qui fuerunt quique futuri sunt posthac<br/>
         stulti, stolidi, fatui, fungi, bardi, blenni, buccones,<br/>
         solus ego omnis longe antideo<br/>
         stultitia et moribus indoctis.<br/></p>

     <p>Of all the fools, chumps, dolts, <i>fungi,</i> oafs, drivelers, and mouth-<br/>
         ing idiots, wherever or whenever &mdash; single-handed I top the lot<br/>
         of them in folly and clumsy behavior!</p>
 </blockquote>

 <p>Genin could have cited parallel examples in English &mdash; Shakespere&rsquo;s &lsquo;toadstool&rsquo; as an epithet, and Sir William Perm&rsquo;s &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;. We will go further and make bold to suggest that the perfect translation of <i>fungus</i> as Plautus used it is the colloquial &lsquo;gump&rsquo;, a humble word that in a wide variety of forms circulates in England, Scotland, Ireland, and America. Its wide use and many forms testify to its long lineage. In Wright&rsquo;s <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i> we find gump(h), gomf, gamp, gamf, gaump, gawmp. We find also sumf and sumph. All these connote human stupidity. As we have seen, words etymologically identical to <i>fungus</i> are the Slavic <i>gamba,</i> German <i>Schwamm,</i> and the English &lsquo;swamp&rsquo;; there is another cognate in English &mdash; &lsquo;sump&rsquo;, a water-filled trap or excavation. Are not &lsquo;gump&rsquo; and &lsquo;sumph&rsquo; etymologically the progeny of the same verbal family? In Plautus&rsquo; <i>Bacchides</i> are <i>not fungi</i> simple &lsquo;gumps&rsquo;?</p>

 <p>But however fascinating for mycophiles and ethno-mycologists these fungi of Plautus and ancient Rome are, what have they to do with truffles, hypocrisy, and Tartuffe ? Was not Genin pursuing the wrong scent &mdash; barking up the tree where Sterne&rsquo;s Smelfungus grows, rather than grubbing for the habitat of Mohere&rsquo;s truffle?</p>

 <p>The creative mind in literature is often made manifest in the selection of names for the characters. Dickens is famous for his names. Take Tulkinghorn in <i>Bleak House:</i> who has not had the misfortune of meeting his replica in the legal profession? The syllables of that name, savored singly or together, suggest by homonymic echo other words and ideas that become a harmonious composite of the repugnant human being to whom Dickens introduces us. When Tristram Shandy&rsquo;s father sought out the treatises on &lsquo;long noses&rsquo; that would help him in coping with his infant&rsquo;s problem, Sterne characteristically devised names faintly smelling of his salacious theme: Prignitz, Scroderus, Parseus, not to speak of the <i>Evening Conferences</i> of Bouchet &mdash; names of such subtle craftsmanship that only the attentive reader catches the message, and then only if he is already familiar with Sterne&rsquo;s prurient nose. The art of devising names for fictitious characters lies in choosing sounds that suggest the sense without declaring it baldly, sounds that reach out like antennae to catch meanings and emotional associations which of themselves go far toward evoking the character whose acquaintance the reader is invited to make. Shakespere&rsquo;s Caliban and Ariel, by an alchemy of phonetic and semantic echoes, offer in their names a foretaste of their roles, and those roles in turn fulfill, richly amplify, and clinch the names, until names and character so thoroughly and unforgettably interpenetrate each other that they are one.</p>
 
 <p>Moliere alone could tell us how he hit on &lsquo;Tartuffe&rsquo;, and he failed to do so. This leaves the field open for others to suggest some of the associations that must have lain in his mind, and in particular to explain how the idea of hypocrisy emerged from the truffle.</p>

 <p>Truffles live out their lives in the dark, dank, cold underground, a fit habitat for repugnant things. The truffle of France is almost black, like the sombre habit and soul of Tartuffe. He was a lecher, and in the iyth century truffles were the supreme aphrodisiac of France. The big, congested nose that we associate with gluttony and wine-bibbing is today in France <i>une bonne truffe:</i> Tartuffe never missed a chance to gorge himself at others&rsquo; tables. There may even have been a Germanic influence in Tartuffe: the German name for the Devil, <i>der Teufel,</i> gave to French the oath <i>tarteifle,</i> recorded in Larousse. If this was known in Moliere&rsquo;s time, the phonetic echo would have been felicitous.</p>

 <p>Underlying all these, however, was another idea &mdash; fraud. In Old French <i>truffe</i> and <i>truffer</i> meant &lsquo;fraud&rsquo; and &lsquo;to defraud&rsquo;. <i>Truffa</i> in Italian and <i>trufa</i> in Spanish signify &lsquo;swindle&rsquo; to this day, and the parallel <i>truhdn,</i> meaning &lsquo;scoundrel&rsquo;, has had a long and vigorous history in the Iberian peninsula. These various forms of the same word turned up in Middle English as the verb &lsquo;to truffle&rsquo; and &lsquo;to trifle&rsquo;, as when one speaks of trifling with a girl&rsquo;s affections. In Scottish cant &lsquo;to truff&rsquo; has meant &lsquo;to befool&rsquo; since before A.D. 1500, somewhat before the &lsquo;Auld Alliance&rsquo; with France. There is no evidence that Chaucer was conscious of the existence of truffles, but he knew the word in its derived meaning, for in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> his Parson defines the sin of idleness as:</p>

 <blockquote>
     <p>the thurrok [i .e., bilge, or sump, or sink] of alle wikked and vileyns thoghtes,<br/>
         and of alle jangles, trufles, and of all ordure, [line 715]</p>
 </blockquote>

 <p>wherein jangles, trufles&rsquo; mean idle chatter and deceits.</p>

 <p>All of those words stem back to the Low Latin <i>truffactor,</i> a swindler. There is also the Italian <i>truaare,</i> the French <i>troauer,</i> which give to English the verb &lsquo;truck&rsquo;, meaning &lsquo;trade&rsquo;. Equally striking is the Italian <i>trafficare,</i> the French <i>trajiquer.</i> The unpleasant flavor of these words survives in some contexts in the English &lsquo;traffic&rsquo;, but, as befits a nation of shopkeepers, with diminished intensity. &lsquo;Traffic&rsquo; and &lsquo;truck&rsquo; are sometimes synonyms, as when the righteous man declares he will have no traffic (or truck) with yonder early prowling, base informing, sly, litigious, plaguy knave. The origin of <i>truccare</i> and <i>trafficare</i> has remained obscure. We suggest that they are related to <i>truffactor,</i> and that they and <i>truffactor</i> itself are all secondary meanings originally derived from the Latin <i>tuber, tufer,</i> the word for the truffle. The truffle-dealer was a notorious tradesman, and he became a by-word. If we are right, the verbal progeny of the truffle, in the figurative sense, arrived in English in the I3th century, almost four centuries before the Englishman came to know the truffle that was the origin of the word.</p>

 <p>The Oxford Dictionary in tracing the history of &lsquo;trifle&rsquo; points out that some philologists have suggested an association with the truffle, but adds that no one has ever proposed a semantic connection. We believe that we can supply such a connection. There is a reason why truffles are associated in some regions with fraud to this day, and why &lsquo;truffle&rsquo; at an early date became a colloquial metaphor signifying fraud. This reason is one that neither philologists nor professional mycolo gists are best attuned to catch.</p>

 <p>When truffles are for sale in the market places of the Mediterranean, <i>caveat</i> <i>emptor!</i> The truffle dealer is even now a by-word among his fellows. He mixes dirt with his truffles to add to their weight. He includes truffles in bad condition. He sells inferior species for the best. He adds swarthy fungi that are not truffles. Truffles, in short, are merchandise that lends itself to fraud. They call for unusual experience in the buyer who would avoid deception. In Adolphe Chatin&rsquo;s <i>La Truffe,</i> already cited, the author devotes a whole chapter to frauds habitually perpetrated in the retailing of truffles. He reports that in the Dauphine, the Provence, and Perigord, where <i>triffe</i> means &lsquo;truffle&rsquo;, the ordinary locutions for calling a man a swindler are "Tes un trrrier" and "Tes un trurfaire". Every truffle fancier teaches his disciples in the first lesson to be on their guard against these perils of the truffle traffic, lest haply they be (as one might say) trifled with and <i>truffled.</i></p>

 <p>This proverbial dishonesty of the truffle merchant has escaped the notice of the philologists who have wrestled with our cluster of words. It supplies the link that the Oxford Dictionary found wanting. It plumbs in depth, back through centuries, the mores of the small-town market-places of Italy, the Provence, and Spain. It supplies the background of double-dealing that appealed to Moliere when he hit on the doublet &lsquo;Tartuffe&rsquo; for the name of his character. To have used &lsquo;Truffe&rsquo; or &lsquo;Truffier&rsquo; would have been crudely blunt and a flaw. The Italian <i>tartufo</i> never took to itself the secondary meaning of fraud. By resorting to it Moliere was achieving his purpose &mdash; hitting on a name that evoked a penumbra of subtle associations, none obvious but all of them of a kind to conjure up the villainy of his hero; associations that are felt rather than thought out, a <i>parfum</i> so elusive that it works its influence and passes undetected. All words are enveloped in such a penumbra, which no lexicographer can pin down, and the essence of great writing is the art of utilizing to the full these emanations, which after all express the most intimate emotions of men in communion with one another.</p>

 <p>In 1836 there appeared in Paris a book entitled <i>De la Truffe,</i> the authorship of which is attributed on the title page to &lsquo;MM. Moynier&rsquo;, about whose identity we have discovered nothing further. Early in that book the reader is told how Moliere came to choose the name &lsquo;Tartuffe&rsquo;. The episode is believable and rings true, but there is no way to verify it. All of the influences and &lsquo;sources&rsquo; that scholars laboriously unravel and dissect and ticket are here synthesized for Moliere in a flash, and the <i>tuber</i> of the Romans, the <i>turma</i> of the Spaniards, the <i>trujfe</i> of the French rises from the crucible of the playwright&rsquo;s mind sublimated and transfigured, imbued as by magic with the immortal attributes of Tartuffe. For Moliere&rsquo;s Tartuffe possesses an eternal vitality, of an order far different from and superior to that other tawdry lure of eternal youth which spurred on Ponce de Leon and his companions, beguiled as they were by childish illusions about <i>batatas</i> and miraculous fountains, doomed as they were in this world, like Tantalus in another, to an endless round of recurring hope and recurring frustration.</p>

 <p>Here then is the genesis of &lsquo;Tartuffe&rsquo;, as related by MM. Moynier: The authors begin by informing their readers that the story is told to them by the Superior of a congregation of Capuchin friars who in 1826 were still living in Aix-en-Provence. The Father Superior explains that from earliest days the truffle was known to the members of his order, and also its renown as an aphrodisiac. In the course of time, he says, it came about that on a particular occasion Moliere was observing one of the worthy fathers consuming some truffles. Moliere was struck by the rotundity of the friar&rsquo;s face and the vermillion coloring of his cheeks, as he sat there ingesting the truffles at his superior&rsquo;s board. He was swathed and muffled in an enormous woollen habit, and the garment even seemed to envelop a goodly part of the table over which he was hunched. He was a picture of deep meditation. As he savored his truffles, the holy man appeared to be either in a state of ecstatic contemplation before a vision of the Blessed Virgin, or else relishing in deep, long draughts certain intimate internal pleasures artfully contrived. "What do you call this thing?", said Moliere to him. "A truffle, my dear Sir," replied the contemplative. Then said Moliere to himself: " Of&nbsp;<i>truffe</i>&nbsp;I shall make Tartuffe, and thou, poor fellow, shalt be he."</p>
