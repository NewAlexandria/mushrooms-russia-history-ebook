  <h1>PREFACE</h1>

  <p class="calibre1"><span class="initial">T</span>his book is addressed to those who love mushrooms, who love the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">whole rich world of wild mushrooms in the same way that many love&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the flowers of the field and the birds of the air. Our public is certainly one&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">of the smallest in the English-speaking world, but no matter. We invite all&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">to share our joys, and if few respond, we are not less happy for being few to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">savor the secret.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is no shortage of writings about wild mushrooms. But in English and&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">all other languages save French the thousands of pamphlets, books, and journals&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">on this subject seem to fall naturally into one or the other of two clusters. Around&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">one pole are gathered the manuals that teach beginners how to tell the species&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">apart, and around the other are the treatises written by mycologists solely for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">other mycologists to read. Ours is one of the few books about mushrooms&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">written for connoisseurs by amateurs. It is the first treatment in any language of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the role played by mushrooms in the daily lives of the varied European peoples.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Strange disparities mark the attitude of these peoples toward mushrooms.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">There is a deep repugnance for 'toadstools' among the folk that dwell around&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the shores of the North Sea. The persistence of this repugnance bears witness,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">if witness were needed, to the extraordinary toughness of an emotional heritage&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">coming down from remotest times. The 'mycophobia' of the North Sea peo</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">ples remains unshaken in the face of continuous exhortations, stretching over&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the past hundred years, from well-informed men of science. We suggest to the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">anthropologists that they will do well to include always in their cultural val</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">uations the question whether a given people is 'mycophile' or 'mycophobe',&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">and if 'mycophagous', what species they eat and love. Here is a subtle criterion&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">for comparative observations all the more valuable because pitched on a lowly&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">level, where man's superior faculties and conscious preoccupations seldom warp&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the ancient grain of impulses passed on to children in their early years.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our essays began as a mere footnote on the gentle art of mushroom-knowing&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">as practiced by the northern Slavs - a footnote in a larger work that was to have&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">dealt with the Russians and their food. The footnote grew, and rose in status&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">to a place in the body of the text, and then mushroomed into a whole chapter,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">and finally one chapter by fission made five. The manuscript has burst all its&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">seams through successive revisions. If occasionally we wander from our theme,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">we hope the reader will be indulgent, bearing in mind that what we have&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">written has been for our own pleasure in the spare hours of a busy life.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">And&nbsp;besides, to play a variation on a familiar French saying, je reviens toujours a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">mes</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">mousserons;</i> <span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">which is to say, we always hark back to our mushrooms. In a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">time of troubles and darkness, we wish this book to be a garland offered in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">tribute to those warm, rich qualities of the Russian people that wicked tyrants&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">strive in vain to crush and extirpate.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The reader who girds his loins and stays our course to the end will perceive&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">a progress in the range and depth of information as he proceeds from chapter&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">to chapter. This is because he is following in the authors' footsteps. The chapters&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">have been composed over a number of years, roughly in the order in which&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">they appear; and because they break new ground in subject and treatment, it&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">has seemed best to let them stand as they were written, for the reader to share&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">in the sense of adventure that the authors experienced in navigating along&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">uncharted coasts of cultural history, never knowing what fresh discovery lay&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">just ahead.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our subject takes us into history and folklore, into mythology and philology.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">The interloper treads these thickly-mined areas at his peril. We accept the risk,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">armed only with the caution that accompanies a full awareness of danger. We&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">have tried to take counsel with the best authorities, and to shade our statements&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">to conform to the evidence. We are more aware than our readers will be of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the many areas of our subject that we have failed to explore. We wish we&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">might without presumption draw an analogy between our book and those&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">paintings of Watteau's where only a few patches of the canvas are illumined&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">against the broad expanse of an undefined and shadowy background.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is altogether fitting for an author to set forth his indebtedness to others,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">and we should do so fully here, were not the list so long and weighty that it&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">would be unseemly and misleading on our part to associate such names with&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">our efforts. The extent to which we have leaned on persons more knowledgeable&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">than we will be apparent to all who know us. The patience of the learned&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">fraternity with our questions has amazed us. Doctors and lawyers and engineers&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">ask fees for their professional advice. But it seems that men of learning, like men&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">of God, stand above these others, bestowing their counsel and blessings freely&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">on all who turn unto them. In the bibliography and notes we have tried to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">pay our debts in full, and also to meet the needs of the more curious reader.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Without my husband's enthusiasm and help this book would never have come&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">to term, and I insist on making clear that he is personally responsible for the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">recondite lore concerning toads, vanished words, poisons, and many other&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">matters in chapters IV and V. The first-person pronouns in our text shift&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">occasionally, and in chapters IV and V regularly, from the singular to the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">plural: there is method in this, for the plural pronouns usually evidence my&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">husband's contributions to our joint undertaking.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">We gladly make special mention also of our debt to Roman Jakobson, the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">Samuel H. Cross Professor of Slavic studies at Harvard University, who com</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">bines in equal degree vast erudition in things Slavic, exquisite standards of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">scholarship, and the infectious enthusiasm of the inspired teacher. Desiring to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">determine what the Basque language might have to contribute to our theme,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">we solicited the counsel of Professor Rene Lafon, holder of the Basque&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">chair at the University of Bordeaux. Generously he lent us his collaboration&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">in what he considered a novel area for research, and in a series of com</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">munications, admirable for their blend of imaginative insight and scholarly dis</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">cipline, he undertook to explore with us, for the first time in Basque scho</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">larship, the rich and tantalizing Basque mushroom vocabulary. Some of the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">fruits of that epistolary interchange will be revealed in the ensuing pages, but&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">it is to be hoped that Professor Lafon himself will find time to incorporate the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">full results of our joint endeavors in a monograph that he alone is qualified&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">to compose. We are specially beholden also to Robert Graves, novelist, scholar,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">and poet, who supplied to us, among other brilliant suggestions, the missing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">link that we had been seeking in order to round out our own conjecture concern</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">ing the death of the Emperor Claudius, and to render that conjecture not merely&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">suggestive but (we make bold to hope) persuasive. We believe that by re-reading&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the age-worn texts in the light of present-day knowledge, we can state with&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">some assurance exactly what lethal agents were used when, at the. behest of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the Empress Agrippina, Locusta undertook to dispose of Agrippina's august&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">spouse. We are under obligations to many libraries for their cooperation, but&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">most of all to The New York Public Library, equally rich in its treasures and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">in its always courteous and efficient personnel-a unique institution, which&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the community on whom it depends fails to esteem at its priceless worth.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">We reserve the last paragraphs of this preface for our illustrations. The whole&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">world knows that Jean-Henri Fabre was a close observer of insects, a distin</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">guished writer, and a person of rare spiritual quality. Only a few know that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">he devoted many hours of his life, in the decade that followed 1885, to painting&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">mushrooms in water-color. His accurate observation was matched by his artistic&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">sensibility. Today hundreds of these pictures he on the shelf of his study at&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">Serignan in the Provence, as fresh in color as the day he painted them, on&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">excellent stock, assembled neatly in the folders where he laid them. He painted&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">all his mushrooms in their natural size, save one that was too big for his paper&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">and that he never succeeded in identifying. During his life-time he sought a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">publisher for them, but when he failed to obtain the assurance that the colors&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">would be truly rendered, he chose to leave them, on the shelf. He wrote little&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">about mushrooms, but in</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">The Life of the Fly</i> <span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">he said they were his botanical&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">joys from his earliest youth, and he went on to predict sadly that the pile of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">hundreds of sheets of his paintings would eventually be shifted from cupboard&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">to cupboard and from attic to attic, to become dirtied and stained and for rats&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">to gnaw, until finally they would fall into the hands of some little grandnephew,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">to be cut into paper caps.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The home of Fabre is now the property of the State, and comes under the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">jurisdiction of the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris. To that insti</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">tution we turned, and through the intercession of the Director of the Laboratoire&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">de Cryptogamie, Professor Roger Heim, Membre de l'Institut, the Assemblee des&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">Professeurs of the Museum graciously granted to us the privilege that we sought.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In May 1950 my husband undertook a pilgrimage to remote Serignan to&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">see the Fabre water-colors, and he picked out more than a dozen for our book.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">Two years later, finding himself again in Paris, he called once more on Professor&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">Heim, who by now had become the Director of the Museum National, a worthy&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">successor in that great post to the illustrious Buffon. Indeed, he sits at Buffon's&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">very table, in Buffon's very room, where the elegant i8th century furnish</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">ings have remained unchanged, the walls adorned with the graceful 18th century&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">oils of Jean-Jacques Bachelier, depicting the birds of the several continents.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">The Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle is one of the fine expressions of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">French cultural achievement, wherein advanced research and teaching in the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">natural sciences are always suffused with a deep understanding of the humanities.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">In Professor Heim the Museum National has once again found a chief who&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">combines in the highest measure those rare qualities of mind and heart that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">have long distinguished the faculty of that extraordinary institution.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Professor Heim proposed to my husband a second visit to Serignan, and this&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">time he himself could go too. Thus it came about that in July 1952 I joined them,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">and together we set out for the Midi, driving by easy stages so as to enjoy&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the lovely and storied landscapes through which we passed, and the food and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">wines as well. (Alas, around mid-July there is a dead-spell in the procession of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">mushroom growths, and we found none on the menus of the hostelries where&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">we stopped.) Finally we arrived in the village of Serignan.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Fabre had acquired his <i class="calibre4">harmas,</i> as any miserable patch of arid land such&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">as his was called in his native&nbsp;</span>Provençal<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">&nbsp;tongue, it was a waste, but with the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">passing years the bushes and trees that he planted have grown to their full height,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">beneath their foliage his fountain plays quietly in the basin, and what was long&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">ago the parched</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">harmas</i> <span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">has grown into one of the most enticing, shaded recesses&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">of the warm and caressing countryside of Provence. Fittingly, the property&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">is in the custody of Henri Fabre's son Paul, and to this day it is called</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">I'Harmas,&nbsp;</i><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">though this is become a misnomer.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Serignan, with Professor Heim's help, we selected ten additional water-<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">colors. Henri Fabre had not of course our needs in mind, and so it happens that in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">his whole wonderful collection we found no examples of two species of mush</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">rooms about which we speak at length, the boletus asreus and the tricholoma&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">georgii or gambosum. By way of compensation we reproduce a number of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">water-colors that are unrelated to our text, solely for their beauty. Professor&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">Heim has been our guide in the scientific designations that we apply to the species&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">pictured by Fabre.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">At our request the Museum National handed over the water-colors that we&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">had chosen to the atelier of Daniel Jacomet in Paris, for reproduction in their&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">original size by the pochoir process. We should like to think that Henri Fabre,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">could he see the results, would be well pleased.</span></p>
