        <section class="main" epub:type="bodymatter chapter">
          <p><span class="initial">T</span>here are three cultural areas in the world where men consume mushrooms for psychic effects. We have just dealt with one of these &#8212; the eating of the <a name="fly-amanita-4">fly amanita</a> by the Hyperboreans of Siberia.</p>

            <p>The second area is in <a name="demonic-new-guinea">New Guinea</a>, in the northeastern part of that island, at the headwaters of the Wahgi River. The practice is reported among the natives living in the Mount Hagen range of mountains, but it may well be more widespread. The Mount Hagen natives are a mixture ethnically of Negritos and Papuans, with some Melanesian blood. Concerning their use of an intoxicating mushroom the available evidence is clear but pitifully meager. In 1947 the American Ethnographical Society published as its Monograph No. 12 a paper by Abraham L. Gitlow entitled &#8216;Economics of the Mount Hagen Tribes&#8217;. He devoted one brief paragraph to intoxicants, and said that one of the three in current use was a mushroom called <i>nonda</i>. Then he continued:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The wild mushroom incites fits of frenzy and has even been known
                    to result in death. It is taken before going out to kill an enemy,
                    or in times of anger, sorrow, or excitement.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>That is all. We are vouchsafed no information about the mushroom itself, or its manner of preparation, or the dosage, or the meaning of its native name; nor any hint of the folk associations that must cling to this potent fungal growth. How odd that professional anthropologists should so often ignore in this way the obvious questions about fungi.</p>

            <p>Thomas Gilliard, an ornithologist of the American Museum of Natural History specializing in the birds of New Guinea, first drew our attention to the Mount Hagen reference. He did more: he suggested that we address a letter to a Catholic missionary working downstream from the Mount Hagen range and inquire about a peculiar fungal practice among the natives there. The Wahgi is a river that runs east and then south into the Gulf of Papua. Below Mount Hagen but still far from the sea it drains a valley shut in on the north by the Bismarck range and on the south by the Kubor mountains. The natives, known as the Chimbu people, are linguistically and culturally distinct from the Mount Hagen tribesmen, though ethnically similar. It seems that among them chastity is not prized as a virtue in young unmarried women, and that to <a name="contraceptive-2">avoid children</a> they eat a certain fungus. Later, when they marry, they give up the fungus and proceed to bear children without let or hindrance. We sent off our letter to Father John Nilles, a member of the Society of the Divine Word, to his station at Mingende, in the Central Highlands of the Territory of New Guinea, and in due course his reply confirmed Mr. Gilliard&#8217;s report:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>I know [he wrote] of one kind of mushroom that is used by women as a means of preventing conception or procuring abortion. A native has brought me two specimens of that kind, of which I send you two cross sections. It grows on old tree stumps in the bush from 6,000 feet up on the slopes of the Chimbu and Wahgi valleys. When fresh the color on top is brown, and white underneath. Small slices are cut off, cooked by the woman between hot stones, and eaten with cooked sweet potatoes.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>On receiving this gracious communication from Father Nilles, we forwarded the mushroom samples at once to Professor Roger Heim in Paris. They were insufficient for definitive identification, but Professor Heim felt confident that the specimens belonged to a genus known in France as ungulina, and probably to the species called by French mycologists the ungulina auberiana (Mont.) Pat. This particular species is abundant throughout the tropics and belongs to the polypores with rigid trama. It staggers under the burden of twenty or thirty competing scientific names; in the collections of the New York Botanical Garden the specimens carry the designation rigidoporus microporus.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">T</span>he watershed of the Wahgi, in the light of the tantalizing information at hand, holds exciting secrets for the exploring ethno-mycologist. But we must leave New Guinea behind and turn to Middle America, the third of our areas. Here we discover the most dramatic story in the whole field of ethno-mycology. There survives to this day in Mexico, within a few hours&#8217; flight of New York, the living cult of a sacred mushroom, a mushroom to which is attributed the power of bestowing on the eater extraordinary faculties. We know that this cult was nourishing when the Spaniards conquered Mexico and we believe there is evidence indicating that it was then millenniums old. For three centuries this cult lay forgotten by the world in the old writings of the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries, while Indians in remote corners of Mexico continued to believe in the mushroom and practice the cult. Only in the last twenty years has the cult come to light again, and even today its existence is known to few. After we had examined the available evidence old and new, we found ourselves succumbing to the spell of the mysterious mushroom with its strange powers and uncertain identity. The possibilities of further exploration in the field drew us more and more, and we proceeded with the pleasant task of laying plans for a trip to the remote Indian tribes of the mountains of Oaxaca. These plans we carried out in 1953.</p>

            <p>Our readers must be patient with us if we develop our story deliberately, laying the groundwork for our own inquiries by first assembling the evidence previously available &#8212; evidence of the highest intrinsic value and not alone for ethno-mycologists. Ten early writers speak of the mushroom cult. We shall translate what they had to say, but as the original sources are often hard to come by, for the convenience of students we supply these texts in Appendix IV on pages 404-407, keyed numerically to the translations in the following pages. Those who read Spanish will relish the style of the old authors, terse, supple, free of literary artifice, the testimony of witnesses putting down on parchment for posterity what they saw and heard and experienced, usually coloring their comments with the religious feelings proper to their age. How exciting it is to exhume from the grave of centuries these almost forgotten voices telling us of the sacred mushroom and the powers attributed to it! This was the age of Richard Hakluyt, and our quotations belong to the world of exploration and discovery that we associate with his name.</p>

            <p>Montezuma,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn1" id="cp5b14-r1">[1]</a></sup> most famous of Aztec kings, assumed his regal office in the year 1502, and the event was celebrated with exceptional pomp. The Spaniards&#8217; carvels were already probing the Caribbean, but Cortez&#8217; landing at Vera Cruz was still seventeen years off. The ceremonies and festivities of the new monarch&#8217;s installation were so spectacular that visitors arrived from far and wide, and even certain of Montezuma&#8217;s traditional enemies, princes of the Tlascalan people, came in disguise to witness the great event. They were discovered, but the magnanimous Montezuma, instead of exploiting their capture, had them royally entertained. After his induction into office, the whole city gave itself over to celebrating with night-long dancing. To the Tlascalan princes were served the inebriating mushrooms, that they might the better enjoy themselves. Almost a century later, in 1598, one Fernando de Alvarado Tezozomoc, of Indian blood, composed a <i>Crónica Mexicana</i>. After giving his account of Montezuma&#8217;s anointing in his chapter 87, he goes on:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: center">[1]</p>

                <p>&#8230; To the strangers they gave woodland mushrooms on which they got drunk, and thereupon they entered upon the dance.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Tezozómoc&#8217;s account is sparing in details. Almost twenty years earlier a Dominican friar, Diego Durán by name and a mestizo by blood, had written his <i>Historia de las Indias de Nueva España</i>, in which the more loquacious cleric gave his account of the same episode:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: center">[2]</p>

                <p>The sacrifice finished, and the steps of the temple and court remaining bathed in human blood, they all went off to eat raw mushrooms, on which food they all lost their senses and ended up in a state worse than if they had drunk much wine; so drunk and senseless were they that many of them took their own lives, and by dint of those mushrooms, they <a name="divination-2">saw visions</a> and the future was revealed unto them, the Devil speaking to them in that drunken state.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Both Tezozómoc and Durán seem to have relied on a single source, now lost to us. Neither described the mushroom nor gave it a name, though we learn that it was associated with the woods and that it was eaten raw. Furthermore, through the friar&#8217;s priestly bias and exaggeration one perceives an important fact: the mushroom was more than an intoxicant, for to it were attributed divinatory powers and these powers were thought by the Catholic chronicler to stem from Satan. How strange that Gitlow in his New Guinea observations should have similarly mentioned a fungal frenzy that led even to suicide.</p>

            <p>Our third witness is Toribio de Benavente called Motolinía, a Franciscan friar who died in 1569. He was the author of a work whose lengthy title begins thus: <i>Ritos antiguos, sacrificios é idolatnas de los Indios de la Nueva España</i>, and in it he gave further details about the extraordinary mushroom. Perhaps one senses behind his words the same lost source on whom the other writers relied, and he ends his account with words that could only have had horrifying connotations for the believing Spaniard of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, for he says that the mushroom in the Indians&#8217; religion played the role of the Host in Christian rites:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: center">[3]</p>
                
                <p>They possessed another method of intoxication, which sharpened their cruelty: for it they used certain mushrooms or small toadstools, for such there are in this land even as in Castile; but those of this land are in such wise that, eaten raw and by reason of their bitterness, [the Indians] drink after them or eat with them some bees&#8217; honey; and shortly thereafter they would see a thousand visions and especially <a name="snake-6">snakes</a>; and as they completely lost their senses, it would seem to them that their legs and body were full of worms eating them alive, and thus half raving they would go forth from their houses, wanting someone to kill them; and by reason of this bestial drunkenness and travail that they underwent, it could happen on occasion that someone would hang himself, and furthermore toward others they would be more cruel. They called these mushrooms in their language <i>teunamacatlth</i>, which means &#8216;<a name="gods-flesh-1">God&#8217;s flesh</a>&#8217;, or of the Devil whom they worshipped, and in this wise with that bitter victual by their cruel God were they houseled.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Motolinía informs us that the inebriating mushroom is small, bitter, and quick to act. He tells us also the name in Nahuatl of the mushroom, and the meaning of that name as he understood it.</p>

            <p>Our fourth witness was, as it happens, a sworn witness in a judicial proceeding. What is more &#8212; and this is significant in delimiting the cultural areas where the inebriating mushroom was in use &#8212; we are now transported to the Mixtec country. The Indians of the land that the world calls Mexico have always been divided among many cultures speaking utterly unrelated languages. At the time of the Conquest the dominant language was Nahuatl and the various tribes speaking it may be called collectively the Nahua; of these the politically dominant tribe was the Aztec. The Mixtec country lies far to the south of the valley of Mexico, in what is today the state of Oaxaca, on the road to the Zapotec country and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. But linguistically the Mixtecs are unrelated to the Nahua and distinct from the Zapotecs.</p>

            <p>On October 15, 1544, in the town of Etlantongo, Esteban Marbán, Scribe and Notary Public in the service of their Majesties of Spain, was taking depositions in a case involving the alleged apostasy of three notables, all of them Indians, principal men of Yanhuitlán, Don Domingo the Cacique and the two <i>Gobernadores</i>, Don Francisco and Don Juan. It seems that, according to report, with &#8216;diabolic ostentation&#8217; for many years they had persisted in invoking their idols and demons after the manner of their ancestors, with all the idolatrous trappings of the old religion. The crux of their offense lay in the fact that they had been baptized in 1527 and they were therefore apostates. The depositions in this case survive, and lengthy extracts were published in 1940 by the Museo Nacional in Mexico as an appendix to one section of the Codex of Yanhuitlán, in an edition of this manuscript edited by Wigberto Jiménez Moreno and Salvador Mateos Higuera. The witness that interests us was one Don Diego, Cacique of the town of Etlantongo, and we note that an interpreter served him: Don Diego must have been at home only in his native Mixtec tongue. After lengthy testimony that we would call hearsay, Don Diego continues:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: center">[4]</p>
                <p>&#8230;and [the witness] knows and saw that some 14 years since, in a fiesta he saw said Don Francisco and Don Juan drunk, and that they had taken <i>nanacates</i> in order to invoke the Devil as their forbears had done, and that it is common knowledge and notorious that whenever it does not rain or when the maize is gathered in, they cry out to the Devil, and when they gather in the maize, they hold their drunken parties.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><i>Nanacate</i> is the hispanicized form of the Nahuatl <i>nanácatl</i>, &#8216;mushrooms&#8217;.</p>

            <p>Our fifth witness is one Gaspar de Covarrubias, Governor of the mines of Temazcaltepec, reporting in 1579 on conditions in his area in a document known as the <i>Relación de las Minas de Temazcaltepec</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn2" id="cp5b14-r2">[2]</a></sup> The working of the mines under the Spaniards had led to an influx of Nahuatl speakers, but Don Gaspar expressly says that the tongue of the native-born population was <i>matalçinga</i>, i.e., Matlatzinca, which today we identify with the Otomí group of languages. Our informant says that in the old days, when the people were still heathen,</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: center">[5]</p>

                <p>&#8230;they were wont to pay in tribute [to the Lord of Mexico], whenever they were asked to do so, two or three loads of hempen blankets, which are made from, a tree that is called <i>maguei</i>, and they would give mushrooms on which people get drunk, and <i>ocote</i> &#8230;</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Additional curious evidence turns up in our sixth source, a book printed in Mexico in 1637 entitled <i>Doctrina y Enseñança en laLengua Mazahua de Cosas muy Utiles, y Provechosas para los Ministros de Doctrina</i>, written by the Licentiate Don Diego de Nágera (or Nájera) Yanguas, incumbent of Xocotitlán. This is a manual for the clergy working among the Indians speaking the Mazahua tongue, which belongs to the Otomi linguistic family. It gives in Spanish and Mazahua, in parallel columns, the questions that a father confessor directs to the penitent, and the various possible responses of the penitent. On folios 27-29 the father confessor catechizes his penitent as to whether he has eaten mushrooms and got drunk on them, or given them to others to get drunk on; and if so, why, whether to find lost objects or for illness. The following extract shows the tenor of the questions, the column in English being added by us:</p>

            <p>Our seventh witness belongs in a different class. Francisco Hernández, a botanist, went out to Mexico in the year 1570 to study and describe the flora of that new world. He devoted seven years to the undertaking, returning in 1577 to Spain with an immense manuscript. Much of it got copied and printed and published in three divergent editions, but the manuscript was lost in a fire in the Escorial without ever being properly edited. Hernández seems to have devoted only a brief section to the mushrooms. We find this passage in Volume II of his <i>Opera</i> brought out in Madrid in 1790, as Chapter 95 of Book IX of the <i>Historia Plantarum Novæ Hispaniæ</i>. Alone among our witnesses, Hernández might be expected to focus attention on the appearance of the sacred mushrooms, and what he says is significant though tantalizingly inadequate. He clearly speaks, not of one, but of three species of mushrooms that either cause psychic symptoms or are clothed in a halo of supernatural associations. The <i>teyhuinti</i> provoke uncontrolled <a name="laughter-2">laughter</a>. Another kind conjures up spectacles of war or the likeness of demons. The search for the third species, bespoken for the tables of the rich and mighty, is attended by all-night vigils, and the mushrooms themselves are saturated in what the anthropologists today call <i>mana</i>. In his manuscript Hernández included illustrations of his mushrooms, but alas! those precious illustrations were apparently lost in the Escorial fire. After describing a lethal species named <i>citlalnanacame</i>, Hernández goes on:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align:center">[7]</p>

                <p>&#8230; others when eaten cause not death but madness that on occasions is lasting, of which the symptom is a kind of uncontrolled laughter. Usually called <i>teyhuinti</i>, these are deep yellow, acrid, and of a not displeasing freshness. There are others again which, without inducing laughter, bring before the eyes all kinds of things, such as wars and the likeness of demons. Yet others are there not less desired by princes for their fiestas and banquets, of great price. With night-long vigils are they sought, awesome and terrifying. This kind is tawny and somewhat acrid.</p>

            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Our eighth and leading witness is the Franciscan friar, Bernardino de Sahagún, who by reason of his moral and intellectual qualities towers over all his contemporaries who were writing about Mexico in the 16<sup>th</sup> century. He devoted his many years in Mexico, from 1529 to 1590, to the systematic and sympathetic study of the Indians among whom he lived and labored. He was the editor and author of an immense work, a major historical document, the <i>Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva España</i>. Published in Spanish in several editions and translated also into French and English, this source is familiar to all historians interested in Mexican culture and the Conquest. Despite its standing as a classic, there is one fact about this book that is sometimes forgotten. It was a bilingual composition, being composed in parallel Nahuatl and Spanish texts. The two texts, while parallel, are not identical. The Nahuatl version preserves the very words of the native informants as they spoke with Fray Bernardino, and to it priority should be given over the Spanish text. There are four brief passages in Sahagún where the inebriating mushrooms figure. The Nahuatl recension differs sufficiently to justify us in offering it, as well as the Spanish text, to our readers, especially as the Nahuatl passages have remained until now hidden behind their linguistic barrier. For locating and translating the Nahuatl passages we are greatly indebted to Professor Charles E. Dibble of the University of Utah, to Dr. Arthur J. O. Anderson of the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe, and to Miguel Barrios of Mexico City.</p>

            <p>From the sources already quoted it is clear that the Indians regarded their inebriating mushrooms with reverence, and this called down on their heads the execrations of professional Christians. The unintentional effect of these denunciations is perhaps to whet the reader&#8217;s appetite for the mysterious fungi. Sahagún&#8217;s Indian informants were doubtless baptized, and perhaps for this reason or perhaps because of the artful simplicity of Fray Bernardino himself, they scarcely link the mushroom with native religious beliefs or divinatory practices, and the hallucinations that they attribute to the eating of mushrooms are so horrible for the most part that one asks why anyone should ever have been tempted by them.</p>

            <p>We shall now offer the four quotations from Sahagún, each of them in duplicate, the translation from the Spanish version followed by the translation from the Nahuatl. The first and longest describes a mushroom party. Merchants have returned from a long and successful journey and they are giving the party to celebrate their success. While the text itself does not hint at religious associations and certainly precludes priestly direction, the context in Book IX is saturated with supernatural beliefs and practices, and leaves the attentive reader in no doubt that the mushroom gathering itself was similarly instinct with the divine presence.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align:center">[8A. <i>From the Spanish]</i></p>

                <p>The first thing eaten at the gathering were certain black little mushrooms, which they call <i>nanácatl</i>, which inebriate and cause hallucinations, and even excite lust. These they ate before dawn, and they also drank cacao before dawn. The mushrooms they ate with honey, and when they began to get heated from them, they began to dance, and some sang and some wept, for now were they drunk from the mushrooms. And some cared not to sing, but would sit down in their rooms, and stayed there pensive-like. And some saw in a vision that they were dying, and they wept, and others saw in a vision that some wild beast was eating them, others saw in a vision that they were taking captives in war, others saw in a vision that they were to be rich, others saw in a vision that they were to own many slaves, others saw in a vision that they were to commit adultery and that their heads were to be bashed in therefor, others saw in a vision that they were to steal something, wherefore their heads were to be bashed in, others saw in a vision that they were to kill someone, wherefore they were to be killed, others saw in a vision that they were drowning in water, others saw in a vision that they would live and die in peace, others saw in a vision that they were falling from on high and would die from the fall. All the disastrous happenings that are wont to happen, these they saw in visions. Others saw themselves sinking in water as in a vortex. Then when the drunkenness of the mushrooms had passed, they spoke one with another about the visions that they had seen.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center">[8B. <i>From the Nahuatl]</i></p>
                
                <p>Coming at the very first, at the time of feasting, they ate mushrooms when, as they said, it was the hour of the blowing of flutes. Not yet did they partake of food; they drank only chocolate during the night. And they ate mushrooms with honey. When already the mushrooms were taking effect, there was dancing, there was weeping. And some still in their right senses sat in their places leaning against their houses; there they merely sit, nodding their heads. Some saw in a vision that already they would die [so] they sat weeping. Some saw in a vision that they would die in war. Some saw in a vision that they would be devoured by wild beasts. Some saw in a vision that they would take the enemy captive in war. Some saw in a vision that they would become rich, wealthy. Some saw in a vision that they would buy slaves, would become slave owners. Some saw in a vision that they would commit adultery [and so] would have their heads bashed in, would be stoned to death. Some saw in a vision that they would steal; [so] also would they be stoned to death. Some saw in a vision that their heads would be crushed with a stone, would be imprisoned. Some saw in a vision that they would perish in the water. Some saw in a vision that they would pass to tranquillity in death. Some saw in a vision that they would fall from the housetop, tumble to their death. All such things would happen to them at this time; all such things they saw, or else they sank into oblivion. And when [the effect of] the mushrooms ceased, they conversed one with another, spoke of what they had seen in visions.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Sahagún tells us that the <i>nanácatl</i> were small and black; that the Indians indulged in them in gatherings assembled for the purpose; and that the intoxicating effects were generally unpleasant for the eaters, which we may doubt. The Spanish text says that they excited lust, an observation calculated to tease the 16<sup>th</sup> century Spaniards, but this observation is missing in the Nahuatl version.</p>

            <p>Sahagún&#8217;s second and third references to the inebriating mushrooms occur in passages primarily concerned with <i>peiotl</i> or &#8216;peyote&#8217;, the cactus product long used by certain Indians for its psychic and other effects, and in recent years an object of intensive study and discussion among anthropologists, biological chemists, psychologists, neurologists, and even literary thinkers like Aldous Huxley. The use of peyote was endemic among the Indians of Mexico north of the Valley of Mexico and of what is now the Southwest of the United States. Sahagún composed his work primarily from within the framework of the Nahua culture with its cultural center in the Valley of Mexico. In the passages that we are about to give, he is speaking of the northern Indians, known to the Nahua collectively as the Chichimecas, a term applied to nomadic Indians generally. The Chichimecas, whatever the language or tribe, were hunters and food-gatherers, nomads, savages to be feared and also despised. Among them there were some, such as the people now known as Otomi, who in historic times had become settled on the land; but they were still by habit called &#8216;Chichimecas&#8217;. To distinguish them from the true nomads, the latter were called tRe &#8216;genuine&#8217; or <i>Teo</i>chichimecas. While there is some ambiguity in the following quotations, we think that, carefully studied, they yield a sensible meaning only if we understand Sahagún as describing the use of peyote among the Northern nomads, and comparing that use with the use of inebriating mushrooms among the Aztecs. It is as though the Aztec compilers were saying, &#8220;The Chichimecas have their peyote just as we have our mushrooms.&#8221; This interpretation, which we accept, was offered to us as a tentative suggestion by Dr. Anderson. If it is right, then apparently the northern limit of the use of the inebriating mushrooms was roughly the Valley of Mexico and the Nahua civilization.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: center">[9A. <i>From the Spanish]</i></p>

                <p>[The Teochichimecas] also possessed great knowledge of herbs and roots, and knew their properties and virtues: It was they who discovered and first used the root they call <i>peyotl</i>, and those who ate and took it, made it serve in place of wine and in place of what are called <i>nanacatl</i> [?], which are the evil mushrooms that inebriate just like wine. And they would gather together on a level spot after having drunk and eat, where they would dance and sing a night and a day, according to their pleasure, and this for one day, for on the morrow they wept much, and they would say that they were cleansing and washing their eyes and faces with their tears.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center">[I0A. <i>From the Spanish</i>]</p>

                <p>There is another herb, like earth&#8217;s testicles [<a name="truffle-8">truffles</a>], which is called peyotl. It is white and grows in the direction of the north. Those who eat and drink it see frightful visions, or laughable ones. This state of drunkenness lasts two or three days and then goes away&#8230;</p>

                <p style="text-align: center">[9B. <i>From the Nahnatl]</i></p>

                <p>And the Teochichimecas had knowledge of the herbs, the roots; how they were, how they propagated. These people discovered the so-called peyote. They esteemed it in place of wine or mushrooms [?]. They gathered somewhere, assembled on the plain. At that place there was song and dance all night and all day. And on the morrow once again they gathered; wept, wept copiously. It was said their faces were washed. With their tears they cleansed their eyes.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center">[10B. <i>From the Nahuatl]</i></p>

                <p>Peyote: this peyote is white and it grows only in the land of the Chichimecas, the land of the god MixcoatJ, which is called the land of the dead north. Whoever eats or drinks of it becomes intoxicated as if by mushrooms. Likewise he sees many things which are frightening or laughable. Perhaps one day or two days he is intoxicated &#8230;</p>

                <p>The fourth and final passage in Sahagún is the most interesting of all. Here he calls the inebriating mushroom by the name that Motolinía used &#8212; <i>teo-nanácatl</i> &#8212; which in its first element carries the religious association that Sahagún avoided elsewhere. Here the mushroom is described in some detail, and the Nahuatl text is much longer and more interesting than the rather arid Spanish:</p>

                <p style="text-align: center">[11A. <i>From the Spanish]</i></p>

                <p>In this land there are certain little mushrooms that are called <i>teonanacatl</i>. They grow beneath the grass in fields or moors. They are round, have a long little stem, thin and round. When eaten they have a bad taste, hurt the throat, and inebriate. They are medicinal for fevers and the gout. Only two or three are to be eaten, not more: those who eat them see visions and feel palpitations of the heart. The mushrooms incite lust in those who eat many, or even be they few. To wild or mischievous youngsters people say that they have eaten <i>nanacatl</i>.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center">[11B. <i>From the Nahuatl</i>]</p>

                <p>One mushroom is called <i>teo-nanácatl</i>. It grows in the waste places, under the grass. The cap is round, the stem is elongated. By its bitterness it hurts, it hurts the throat. It intoxicates one, makes one dizzy, makes one violent. It helps in fevers, gout. Only two or three are to be eaten. It makes one suffer, causes affliction, makes one restless, causes one to flee, frightens one, makes one hide. He who eats many, <a name="divination-3">many things sees</a>. He terrifies people, makes them laugh. He strangles himself, hurls himself from high places, cries out, is afraid. When he eats it in honey he says, I eat mushrooms, I bemushroom myself. Of the boaster, the braggart, the vain one it is said, &#8220;He bemushrooms himself.&#8221;</p>

            <p>So far we have quoted only from 16<sup>th</sup> century sources. Our ninth witness belonged to a later generation. He is Jacinto de la Serna, a cleric who in the middle of the 17<sup>th</sup> century composed a guide for clergy ministering to the Indians. His work was entitled <i>Manuel de Ministros de Indies para el Conocimiento de sus Idolatrías y Extirpación de Ellas</i>. He was a garrulous busybody, zealous in rooting out and extirpating all expressions of the Indians&#8217; old religion, and eager in his narrative to leave a record of his own zeal. Chapter IV of his work continues a recital of incidents that had happened to the author proving (as he says) that idolatry was still rampant among the Indians in his own time. In Section 3 of this chapter lie is discussing native physicians and midwives, especially the rôamerican footballle of &#8216;witchcraft&#8217; in their practices, and certain goings on in his own household that had aroused his liveliest suspicions. A certain Indian, master of the native lore, had lately arrived in the village and had officiated at a religious rite in which the intoxicating mushrooms had been a central feature. The description of the religious ceremony reaches us through Don Jacinto by hearsay only, as of course he was not present, but it carries a ring of authenticity, and reminds us of the stirring words with which Motolinía ended his observations on the mushroom:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: center">[12]</p>

                <p>And what happened was that there had come to [the village] an Indian, a native of the village of Tenango, great maestro of superstitions, and his name was Juan Chichitón, which means &#8216;little dog&#8217;, and he had brought the red-colored mushrooms that are gathered in the uplands, and with them he had committed a great idolatry, and before I tell of it, I wish to describe the property of said mushrooms, which are called in the Mexican language <i>Quautlannamacatl</i>, and having consulted the Licenciate Don Pedro Ponce de Leon, the great Minister and Master of Masters as I said in Chapter II, he told me that these mushrooms were small and golden, and to gather them it was the custom for the priests and old men deputized as ministers for this kind of humbuggery to go up into the mountain, and they remained almost the whole night in prayer and superstitious entreaties, and at dawn, when there sprang up a certain breeze that they knew, then they gathered the mushrooms, attributing divinity to them, possessing as they did the same effect as <i>ololiuqui</i> [rivea corymbosa (L.) Hallier filius] or <i>peyote</i> [Lophophora Williamsii (Lem.) Coulter], because whether eaten or drunk, it intoxicates them and deprives them of their senses, and makes them believe a thousand foolish things. And so this Juan Chichiton, having gathered the mushrooms on a certain night, in the house where everyone had gathered on the occasion of a saint&#8217;s feast, the saint was on the altar, and the mushrooms with <i>pulque</i> and a fire beneath the altar, the <i>teponastli</i> [a percussion instrument peculiar to the Aztecs] and singing going on the whole night through, after most of the night had passed, said Juan Chichiton, who was the priest for that solemn rite, to all those present at the fiesta gave the mushrooms to eat, after the manner of Communion, and gave them <i>pulque</i> to drink, and finished off the festivities with an abundance of <i>pulque</i>, so that what with the mushrooms on the one hand and the pulque on the other, they all went out of their heads, a shame it was to see.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>Don Jacinto goes on to relate how he had made utmost efforts to ferret out and lay his hands on Chichitón. There was a hot chase, but by the skin of his teeth the &#8216;Little Dog&#8217; had eluded his pursuer&#8217;s clutches &#8212; to the considerable relief of the modern reader, who hopes that Chichitón lived to preside over many another mushroomic agape.</p>

            <p>Our tenth and final source is French: the <i>Histoyre du Mechique</i>, written by André Thévet not later than 1574. His text is a translation or paraphrase of a lost work, <i>Antigüedades Mexicanas</i>, written about 1543 by the Spanish cleric Andrés de Olmos. The historian is speaking of events that had taken place in the middle of the 15<sup>th</sup> century, and thus he is placing the use of our mushrooms earlier than any of our other sources, and he places them in an Otomí context. Thevet&#8217;s manuscript lies in the Bibliothèque Nationale and was first published in 1905, edited by Ed. de Jonghe, in the <i>Journal de la Société des Américanistes de Paris</i> (Nouvelle Sèrie, vol. II). Our quotation is from the fourth chapter, page 18:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-align: center">[13]</p>

                <p>&#8230; Said Lord of Tezcuq [Tezcoco] &#8230; paid great reverence to the gods and took great care of the temples and ceremonies; he commanded also that the youths and maidens should dance in the temples, &#8230; that they should strew the temple with roses and flowers, dancing constantly before them, both those of the city and the near neighbors, whom the devil abused making them eat some herb that they call <i>naucatl</i>, which made them lose their senses and see many visions.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">O</span>ur ten documentary sources treating of the divine mushrooms are supported by other linguistic evidence. There are several early lexicons to cite. The year 1571 saw the publication in Mexico of a Nahuatl dictionary, <i>Vocabulario en lengua castellana y mexicana</i>, compiled by Alonso de Molina. In its pages we discover under <i>hongo</i> a series of names for mushrooms that inebriate, <i>hongos que emborrachan</i> or <i>que embeodan</i>. Here are these words, with their literal translation:</p>

            <p>Molina, born in Spain, arrived with his parents in Mexico in 1523 and after learning Nahuatl served the Franciscan friars as interpreter. We know not how reliable his mushroom names are. Hernández, as we have seen, also mentions the <i>teyuinti</i>, but neither Hernández nor Molina uses <i>teo-nanácatl</i>, which we find only in Sahagún and Motolinía.</p>

            <p>More interesting for us than Molina&#8217;s work is a Zapotec lexicon, <i>Vocabulario Castellano-Zapoteco</i>, compiled by Fray Juan de Cordoba and published in 1578 in Mexico. In it we find the words <i>péaçóo</i>, <i>péyaçóo</i>, which he defines as <i>honguillo o xeta con que se emborracha</i>, &#8216;little mushroom or toadstool on which one gets drunk&#8217;. (The accents on his words appear to represent glottal stops.) Under <i>xeta</i> he reports an intoxicating mushroom that grows in trees, which he calls <i>nocuana peneeche</i>, a designation that the Zapotec of today fails to recognize.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn3" id="cp5b14-r3">[3]</a></sup></p>

                    <p>Linguistic areas where contemporary reports establish use of divinatory mushrooms. As modern evidence indicates that the cult prevails only in uplands, all contours below, say, 600 meters should probably be excluded. Conversely, upland areas such as Mazatec and Chatino as to which early evidence is lacking undoubtedly used the mushroom. Northern limits are quite definitely fixed, but eastern limits in Chiapas are uncertain.</p>

            </figure>
            
            <p>Here then is proof that the inebriating mushroom was familiar to the Zapotecs, and thus we establish as a minimum range for the use of the inebriating mushroom an area that includes the Nahua and Otomí peoples, the Mixtecs, and southeastward to the Zapotecs of the Valley of Oaxaca and probably the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. If our interpretation of Sahagún is right, the use of the mushroom petered out as one advanced north from the Valley of Mexico, being replaced by the peyote of cactus origin. To the southward we cannot define the boundaries. Our information about the important Zapotecs is relatively rich, by comparison with the complicated mosaic of other Indian cultures on all sides of them.</p>

            <p>But there are a few other old lexicons that document the use of our mushrooms. Some years ago Walter Miller discovered the manuscript of an early Mije dictionary in the Mije village of San Lucas Camotlán. It now lies in the Museo Nacional. In it &#8216;the little mushroom with which people get drunk&#8217;, <i>el honguillo con que se emborrachan</i>, is rendered by the Mije word <i>maxmux</i>. The manuscript may date from the 18<sup>th</sup> century. A Tarascan lexicon composed by Fray-Maturino Gilberti and published in 1559 translates &#8216;the mushroom that inebriates&#8217; by the expression <i>cauiqua terequa</i>, wherein the second element means &#8216;mushroom&#8217;. The Tarascans live in Michoacan, to the west of Mexico City. Already we have placed the mushrooms in the Matlatzinca country: our previous evidence is confirmed by the Matlatzinca lexicon of Fray Diego Basalenque, dated 1642, a manuscript copy of which belongs to the John Carter Brown Library in Providence, R. I. The inebriating mushroom is the <i>intza chohui</i>, and we discover that <i>chohui</i> means both &#8216;mushroom&#8217; and apparently &#8216;fiesta&#8217;!</p>
            
            <p>Now we come to evidence of a wholly different character. We believe that we detect in the subtleties of Nahuatl grammar a clear expression of the awe in which the divine mushroom was held. Let us examine that term <i>teo-nanácatl</i>, used by Sahagún and Motolinía. The initial element <i>teo-</i> carries in Nahuatl three distinct meanings. It can signify simply &#8216;great&#8217; or &#8216;important&#8217;. It may mean &#8216;genuine&#8217; or &#8216;real&#8217;, as in <i>Teo-chichimecas</i>. It is derived from <i>teotl</i>, &#8216;god&#8217;, and may mean &#8216;divine&#8217; or &#8216;sacred&#8217;; <i>teo-nanácatl</i> means unquestionably the &#8216;sacred mushrooms&#8217;. <i>Nanácatl</i>, in turn, is formed by a duplication of the initial syllable of <i>nácatl</i>, &#8216;flesh&#8217;. Thus mushrooms are called &#8216;flesh&#8217; in Nahuatl, assuming however the plural form <i>nanácatl</i> This particular fungal metaphor has its analogy in the Pashto language of <span id="afghanistan">Afghanistan</span>, where there is a word for &#8216;mushroom&#8217;, <i>pocəkəí</i> (<i>pōtsəkəī</i>) that is a feminine variation of <i>pōtsəkaī</i>, meaning &#8216;soft flesh&#8217; such as the flesh of the ear lobe. (Of course we do not suggest a genetic kinship between these metaphors, but when we think that we have come upon a simple figure of speech in a fungal vocabulary, it is reassuring to discover that the same association of ideas has occurred to other peoples.) The figure of speech in <i>teo-nanácatl</i> was a living one in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, for Motolinía translates the term as <i>carne de dios</i>, &#8216;<a name="gods-flesh-2">god&#8217;s flesh</a>&#8217;, and then immediately this good Catholic offers his own substitute, <i>carne del demonio</i>, &#8216;Satan&#8217;s flesh&#8217;, thus illustrating the old truth that one man&#8217;s God is another man&#8217;s Devil. Perhaps the interesting thing about <i>nanácatl</i> is its plural form. In Nahuatl nouns representing inanimate things are invariable as to number, and by this grammatical convention the vegetable world is inanimate. But there are significant exceptions, of which the following three are outstanding:</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>&#160;</th>
                    <th>Singular</th>
                    <th>Plural</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Sky</td>
                    <td><i>ilhuicatl</i></td>
                    <td><i>ilhuicame</i></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Mountain</td>
                    <td><i>tepetl</i></td>
                    <td><i>tetepe</i></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Star</td>
                    <td><i>citlálin</i></td>
                    <td><i>citlaltin</i></td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>These exceptions are apparent rather than real, for the Nahua personified the sky, mountains, and stars, and the plural form simply expresses the way of feeling that attributed to these cosmic beings a soul. There are other exceptions similarly suggestive. For example, <i>tetl</i>, &#8216;stone&#8217;, becomes <i>teme</i> in the plural, but only when it refers to graven images. We believe that another exception is our <i>nanácatl</i>, a plural form expressive of the divine afflatus dwelling in the inebriating mushrooms.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn4" id="cp5b14-r4">[4]</a></sup></p>

            <p>How impressive is this grammatical evidence of the rôle of the mysterious mushroom in the Nahua mentality! It becomes all the more noteworthy when we discover a perfect parallel among another mycophilic people, in this case the Russians. At an early stage in the evolution of the Slavs there developed a tendency to substitute the genitive case for the accusative when a masculine noun representing an animate creature was the goal of the verb. Today this is the rule in the various Slavic languages. In folk Russian this genitive is used not only for nouns denoting animate beings, but also for the names of various mushrooms and sometimes for certain trees, when the mushroom or tree is individualized, i.e., is a single entity.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn5" id="cp5b14-r5">[5]</a></sup> This use is widespread in Russian dialects, and occurs also in Ukrainian and White Russian. One hears <i>nashol griba</i>, &#8216;he found the mushroom&#8217;, with <i>griba</i> in the genitive case; <i>nashol grusdja</i>, <i>ryzhika</i>, <i>borovika</i>. Among the trees the oak is especially favored by similar treatment, e.g., <i>srubil duba</i>, &#8216;he chopped down the oak&#8217;. The oak used to be worshipped in pagan times by the eastern Slavs as the thunder tree dedicated to the god Perún. Thus in the folk language we discover a grammatical expression of animism. It is possible to offer yet another example in Russian. In the standard language the mushroom known as the <i>masljenik</i> has a special plural form, <i>masljata</i>, and the plural of another mushroom name is <i>opjata</i> in certain uneducated circles. The plural suffix here used is normal only with certain nouns designating young animals, birds, and children! These peculiarities in Russian grammar show that our interpretation of <i>nanácatl</i> does not strain credulity. Parallels in unrelated languages and cultures of this kind reinforce each other; that is, they illuminate a common trait, in this case the inclination of peoples strongly mycophile to personify their beloved mushrooms.</p>

            <p>After our long parade of early authorities and learned analysis, let us sum up what we have discovered. When the Spaniards arrived in Mexico, they found an inebriating mushroom in wide use among the Indians from the Valley of Mexico southwards. This mushroom produced hallucinations that the Indians thought were divinely inspired. One author, Hernández, says expressly that there were various species of such mushrooms, and as he was a botanist his testimony is weighty. The lexicographer Molina mentions five species. There is a multiplicity of names for the inebriating mushrooms in Nahuatl, for which various explanations may be offered. Each species would have its own name, of course, and furthermore the names might vary according to the region. A third possibility is that the divine aura bathing the mushrooms might cause people to take refuge in euphemistic alternative names. The mushrooms of course were wild and seem to have grown both in meadows and in the woods. (Jacinto de la Serna refers to them as <i>quautlannamacatl</i>, &#8216;woodland mushrooms&#8217;.) As to one species, Sahagún says that they were small, with a stipe long for the height, thin and round. Sahagún describes these as black, but others speak of the inebriating mushrooms as golden or tawny or approaching red. In two authors we hear of ceremonies attending the gathering of mushrooms &#8212; nights of prayer and vigil. Four clearly associate the mushrooms with religious rites. Six agree that it was used in communal festivities that bordered on orgies and led to wild excesses. The mushrooms were eaten raw, and the taste was acrid or bitter, honey being used as the vehicle for swallowing them. There is no reason to believe that our Spanish witnesses tasted the mushrooms, for (unless they came from Catalonia) they were mycophobes and this cultural heritage would reinforce an initial repugnance for native &#8216;idolatries&#8217;. But some of our witnesses were Indians, albeit converted, and they must have known the taste and accurately described it. Sahagún alone speaks of a medicinal virtue in the mushrooms: he says that the <i>teo-nanácatl</i> were good for gout and fevers. But on this point it is noteworthy that the mushrooms are not even mentioned in the great medicinal herbal of the Aztecs, known as the Badianus manuscript, which was compiled in Sahagún&#8217;s own convent, the Colegio de la Santa Cruz at Tlaltelulco, and doubtless under his supervision.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn6" id="cp5b14-r6">[6]</a></sup></p>

            <p>There may well be references to our sacred mushrooms in the old writers that we have not come upon, and in the voluminous archives of unpublished documents in Mexico additional references will surely be discovered. At the same time we must also stress the fact that by our method of culling and distilling the references to the sacred mushrooms we inevitably convey an impression of their importance that is scarcely supported by the whole corpus of documents relating to 16<sup>th</sup> century Mexico. That documentation is immense. Other narcotic herbs also play a rôle therein: <i>poyomatl, ololiuqui, peiotl;</i> and tobacco <i>(pisiete]</i> was also treated as though it belonged in the same category. There are important 16<sup>th</sup> century sources dealing with such matters where references to the inebriating mushrooms are strangely absent: one of these is that valuable work, <i>Problemas y Secretes Maravillosos de las Indias</i>, written by Juan de Cardenas and published in Mexico in 1591.</p>

            <p>From the beginning of our inquiries into the sacred mushroom of the Nahua we were on the lookout for 16<sup>th</sup> century illustrations of it. The botanist Hernández in his text said that he was depicting four kinds of mushrooms including the <i><b>teyhuinti,</b></i> but the 1790 edition carried no illustrations, and his drawings, which would have been precious for us, must have been consumed in the Escorial fire. However, our searches have not been bootless. In the Florentine Codex we have discovered one picture, hitherto unremarked by students, and Robert J. Weitlaner has drawn our attention to a second in the Magliabechiano Codex.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn7" id="cp5b14-r7">[7]</a></sup> We take pleasure in reproducing both in faithful color, this being facilitated by a happy chance: the two codices, though lying in different libraries, are both in Florence.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn8" id="cp5b14-r8">[8]</a></sup> The illustrations are singularly significant for us, being complementary, one of them executed by a Spanish artist and the other by an Indian in the tradition of his people, though he shows traces of Spanish influence. Both illustrations are in the nature of pictographs, vignettes intended to convey almost a verbal message. Neither tells the mycologist anything mycological about the sacred mushrooms, but both are eloquent and curious expressions of the contrasting attitudes of the two peoples toward them.</p>

            <p>Sahagún&#8217;s great work survives in two principal codices, of which the Florentine Codex, profusely illustrated, ranks first. Although most of the illustrations were done by native artists, some were by Spaniards, and it was a Spaniard who made the five small pictures representing various mushrooms that Sahagún mentions. A close inspection of the five pictures and Sahagún&#8217;s text makes it clear that the artist worked from the text, and possessed no knowledge of the mushrooms outside the text. When he came to the inebriating mushroom, he undertook to convey his iconographic message in a way natural to a 16<sup>th</sup> century Spaniard: a demon is portrayed rising from a cluster of tawny (not black) mushrooms, and the demon carries those conventional stigmata that as represented by a 16<sup>th</sup> century Spanish artist. From Florentine Codex of Bernardino de Sahagún&#8217;s <i>Historia de las</i> <i>Cosas de la Nueva Espafia</i>. Biblioteca Laurenziana, Florence. commonly identified Satan in the Gothic and Spanish worlds. He is clothed cap-a-pie in fur, a huge beak emerging from his fur-enclosed face. For hands he has claws. One foot is unformed or malformed, perhaps a splay foot. This is the malformed foot that survives in the English &#8216;cloven hoof, that led the French to speak of the Devil as <i>le Bot</i>, the Cripple.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn9" id="cp5b14-r9">[9]</a></sup> In this French word and in this picture we find blended the recurring themes of our book &#8212; Satan portrayed as <i>le Bot</i>, a demonic mushroom, and offstage, by metaphoric transfer, the toad called <i>le bot</i> that constitutes the third of our unholy trinity.</p>

            <p>The second illustration offers us three elements &#8212; mushrooms, a man eating mushrooms, and behind and over him a ghost. The reader will notice that the man holds a mushroom in each hand. According to Professor Jimenez Moreno, the ghost is probably Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Underworld, who is depicted on other pages of the same Codex. How far removed from the Spaniard&#8217;s conception is the Indian&#8217;s! Not only is the craftsmanship of these artists, contemporaries of each other, poles apart; their message is likewise. The Spaniard reports rather prosaically the existence of a demonic mushroom to his European public. The Indian, though undoubtedly a baptized Christian, conveys a sense of the awe that he still felt in the presence of the mysterious <i>teo-nanácatl</i>. That the mushrooms in this miniature are green should not disconcert the mycologist: green, the color of jade, meant in Mexican iconography that the object so depicted was of great worth.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">T</span>he last of our citations from old Spanish documents was from the mid-seventeenth century: Jacinto de la Serna&#8217;s episode with Chichitón. With him the references to the inebriating mushrooms ended. Thereafter observers no longer reported on the mushroom cult, and except in new editions of old books and in works based on them, the cult was never more mentioned. The cult itself was apparently extinct, and only a handful of specialists knew that it had ever existed. For example, Francisco A. Flores, when in 1886-8 he brought out in Mexico his three volume <i>Historia de la Medicina en Mexico</i>, listed the Nahuatl names for the inebriating mushrooms as given by Molina, translated them, and then rashly by sheer guesswork tried to identify them according to the classifications of mycologists. William H. Prescott in his classic <i>Conquest of Mexico</i> ignored the subject. Yet we know that he was familiar with it. He drew on most of the sources that we have cited, and in particular the two accounts of Montezuma&#8217;s assumption of office. In Book II Chapter 6 he speaks of the &#8216;honorable entertainment&#8217; offered to the Tlascalan princes by Montezuma, but he deftly excises the reference to the sacred mushrooms. By now one is so used to the subconscious rejection of mushrooms by the mycophobic Anglo-Saxons that it would be more a matter of remark if Prescott had mentioned the <i>teo-nanácatl</i>.</p>

            <p>Then suddenly one day the sacred mushrooms sprang to life again. On May 4, 1915, an ethno-botanist of established and deserved reputation, W. E. Safford, read a paper before the Botanical Society in Washington in which he flatly and sweepingly denied that there had ever been an inebriating mushroom in the indigenous cultures of Mexico. His paper was published later in that year in the <i>journal of Heredity</i>, and it was a full-dress presentation, richly illustrated and documented. Dr. Safford said that the Spanish &#8216;padres&#8217; (as he somewhat condescendingly called them) had been confused: they had taken for mushrooms what had really been dried buttons of a cactus, the Lophophora Williamsii, the <i>peyotl</i> of Aztec times, the mescal button of Texas. He declared that three centuries had failed to reveal a fungal intoxicant in Mexico. He quoted Sahagún as saying that the Chichimecas had been the first Indians to discover the alleged intoxicating property of the &#8216;mushroom&#8217;; he went on to say that the Chichimecas had occupied northern Mexico, that that was therefore the region where to seek the mushroom, that he had pushed his own researches exhaustively in those areas and in the Southwestern states of the United States, and that he had found nothing.</p>

            <p>Dr. Safford&#8217;s paper drew wide attention and was widely accepted. Many learned from it for the first time that there had been a belief in an inebriating mushroom, at the same time that they learned the mushroom had never existed. How ironic it will be if Dr. Safford himself, in the long run, should be remembered chiefly because of this resounding blunder that he made, a classic example of the fallibility of the specialist! For of course the Spanish &#8216;padres&#8217; were right and Dr. Safford was wrong. Dr. Safford&#8217;s paper was extraordinary for the vehemence (may we say &#8216;telltale&#8217; vehemence?) that this Anglo-Saxon showed in rejecting the <i>teo-nanácatl</i>. It never occurred to him that he had to demolish not only the Spanish &#8216;padres&#8217; but also all the native informants on whom they relied, and even the Nahuatl vocabulary that they used!</p>

            <p>The source of Dr. Safford&#8217;s error lay in his misreading of Sahagún&#8217;s sentence about the Chichimecas and the emphasis that he placed on this single misconstrued passage. Loosely constructed though the sentence is after the fashion of 16<sup>th</sup> century prose, its meaning is clear. The Chichimecas were the first to use the <i>peyotl</i>, says Sahagún, and they used it in the way that we the Nahua (Sahagún&#8217;s informants) use the inebriating mushroom. We may be sure that Dr. Safford canvassed the Chichimeca country thoroughly, and his negative findings there and in the Southwest of the United States tend to confirm our interpretation of Sahagún.</p>

            <p>Just as toxins appropriately administered stimulate the growth of anti-bodies, so the Safford paper served a useful purpose in stimulating the inquiries of Mexican workers, who properly resented the charge that early Spanish observers could not tell a mushroom from a cactus button. The details of this inquiry need not detain us here. To Dr. Blas Pablo Reko, a Mexican of Austrian birth and Slavic provenience, belongs the primary accolade for persisting in the search for the mushroom cult. He was the first to declare his belief that the cult still survived. He so expressed himself shortly after the Safford lecture, and he began to look for the cult in the State of Oaxaca. To Robert J. Weitlaner goes the distinction of having first re-discovered the sacred mushrooms themselves. This excellent anthropologist and tireless worker laid his hands on samples in the remote town of Huautla de Jimenez, Oaxaca, in 1936. He sent them to Dr. Reko who in turn forwarded them to the botanical authorities at Harvard. They arrived in bad condition but could be identified as a species of panaeolus. Huautla is the chief town of the Indians known as Mazatecs.</p>

            <p>In that same year Dr. Reko&#8217;s cousin, Victor A. Reko, had published in Stuttgart the first paper challenging the Safford argument, <i>Magische Gifte: Rauschund Betäubungsmittel der Neuen Welt</i>. In 1938 a young Harvard ethno-botanist, Dr. Richard Evans Schultes, visited Huautla and obtained additional samples of the mushrooms and photographs of them in a fresh state. With the help of Dr. David Linder of the Farlow Herbarium, Harvard University, he identified them as panseolus campanulatus L. var. sphinctrinus (Fr.) Bresadola. His specimens, carefully preserved, were again examined in the fall of 1955 by Roger Heim, who confirmed without hesitation the previous identification. In that same year 1938, on the night of Saturday-Sunday, July 16-17, four white persons in Huautla attended a mushroom rite performed expressly for them. The four were the promising young anthropologist Jean Bassett Johnson, his wife Irmgard Weitlaner-Johnson, Bernard Bevan, and Louise Lacaud. In a paper published the following year Mr. Johnson gave to the world the first account of the ancient rite: there is no evidence that any white persons had ever before attended it.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn10" id="cp5b14-r10">[10]</a></sup> He did not identify the mushrooms that were used.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">I</span>n European sources there is some evidence of inebriating mushrooms in addition to the <a name="fly-amanita-5">fly amanita</a>. Indeed, the earliest recorded reference to psychic symptoms caused by mushrooms clearly did not relate to the amanita muscaria. Before describing the fly amanita Albertus Magnus in <i>De Vegetalibus</i> remarks on the propensity of certain mushrooms to bring about mental disturbance:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Signum autem, quod habent humidum vaporosum, est, quod comesti frequenter oppilant vias spirituum animalium in capite, et inducunt insaniam.</p>

                <span class="pull-right">[Op. cit., Book 2, Chap. 6:87]</span>

            <p>Moreover, an indication that they [fungi] are of a moist humor is that when eaten they often stop up in the head the mental passages of the creatures [that eat them], and bring on insanity.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The great Clusius may have described, an inebriating mushroom. In the section on the <i>Fungi perniciales</i> of Hungary he arrives at the eleventh of the evil species and says this concerning it:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Ungaricum nomen nullum intellexi, sed Germanicum est <i>Narrenschwammen</i> ac si diceres fatuum vel fatuorum fungum, quoniam forte, si quis vescatur, mente turbetur &#8230; Corpore dum e sua volva erumpit, est boleto dissimili, longiore pediculo subnixum minimo digito graciliore, sescuncialis latitudinis, in metam assurgens, superna parte candida, inferna camerata, &amp; multis striis, a pediculo in ambitum productis, notata.</p>

                <p>I did not learn its Hungarian name, but in German it is <i>Narrenschwamm</i>, i.e., &#8216;foolish fungus&#8217; or &#8216;<a name="fools-mushroom-2">fungus of fools</a>&#8217;, since one may see that he who eats becomes mentally upset&#8230; Its body, when once it has broken its volva, is unlike the Boletus, with a stipe thinner than the little finger, [the cap] less than 4 cm. in diameter, heading up into a conical top, white above, partitioned below with multiple furrows, radiating from the stem in a circle.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Our Hungarian friend, Dr. Stephan F. Borhegyi, has supplied us with the Magyar name that Clusius failed to get: <i>bolond gomba</i>, &#8216;fool-mushroom&#8217;, a term still familiarly used in Hungary, especially in the rural areas, as when one asks of a person behaving foolishly, &#8220;Have you eaten the fool&#8217;s mushroom;&#8221;, or when one rejects a proposition by saying, &#8220;Do you think I have eaten a fool-mushroom, that I should do such a thing?&#8221; Or again: &#8220;He is laughing as though he had eaten fool&#8217;s mushrooms.&#8221; In Hungary the &#8216;wise-woman&#8217;, <i>javas asszony</i>, is said to use this same mushroom in love philtres, and the angry lover sends the philtre on to the object of his passion. We think this is the same mushroom that, as we saw on page 78, the Slovakian peasant calls <i>šalené huby</i>. The Slovakian word finds a surprising echo in the 17<sup>th</sup> century verses of the Polish poet Wacław Potocki, which we mentioned on page 15. He is advising his readers about mushrooms, and warns them against a kind called <i>szmer</i>, lest it render the reader foolish (<i>szaleć</i>) &#8216;as from opium&#8217;! In Vienna one may hear the saying, <i>Er hat verrückte Schwammerln gegessen</i>, &#8216;He has eaten the mad mushrooms.&#8217; Whether this is native to the Austrian countryside, or a loan made in imperial times from Hungary or the Carpathians, we do not know.</p>

            <p>Thanks to Clusius and the Continental usage, John Parkinson in his <i>Theatricum Botanicum</i> (1640) speaks of the &#8216;foolish mushroom&#8217;, describing it rather well:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>&#8230; about half an inch broad, spiring a little at the toppe, and being of a whitish colour, with a long stalke, of the thicknesse of ones little finger: this is called the foolish or the fooles Mushrome. [P. 1321]</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>What was and is this fool&#8217;s mushroom that Albertus Magnus mentioned and Clusius described and the peasants of central Europe invoke in their old saws? Our only good clue lies in the paintings that Clusius made, now preserved in Leiden: for Clusius the <i>Narrenschwamm</i> was, beyond a doubt, the amanita vaginata. Is it possible that this edible mushroom, if eaten raw, causes psychic disturbance? Clusius&#8217; identification is uncorroborated. Is it possible that he made a mistake, that his informants in Hungary were not heirs to the true tradition, that they were not privy to the secret? Perhaps the folklorists of Central Europe can yet run to earth the haunting reference incapsulated in the <i>Narrenschwamm</i>, with its echoes of far-off fungal knowledge.</p>

            <p>We might have expected the &#8216;fool&#8217;s mushroom&#8217; to be a species of panæolus, for there is medical evidence to support the intoxicating virtue of this genus of mushrooms. A surgeon named G. Glen, Esq., reported on a case in the <i>London</i> <i>Medical and Physical Journal</i>, 1816, on pages 451-3. It seems that on October 16 of that year a poor man living in Knightsbridge gathered a mess of mushrooms around a copse behind the Horse Guards barracks in Hyde Park. He thought they were <a name="field-mushroom-9">field mushrooms</a>, and after stewing them, proceeded to eat them. About eight or ten minutes later, when only six or eight mushrooms were left on his plate, he was seized with giddiness, dimness of vision, and a general loss of power. With utmost difficulty and only by the help of a friend whom he met, he made his way to Mr. Glen&#8217;s consulting room five hundred yards away. He was reeling like a drunken man. It is noteworthy that Mr. Glen says his patient spoke with hesitation and reluctantly, and was greatly inclined to sleep. There was no nausea. By the next day the patient was well on the road to recovery, and Mr. Glen was inclined to the view, natural to medical men under the circumstances, that his own ministrations had either saved the poor man&#8217;s life or spared him a prolonged illness. Mr. Glen examined the mushrooms left from the stew and also gathered fresh ones from the place where the first had been found. He identified them as panseolus campanulatus Linn., and this was confirmed by a Mr. William Salisbury of Sloane Street, a person deemed competent in the matter. Mr. Glen drew attention to the fact that two parallel cases had been summarily reported in the August 1815 issue of the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i>, the same species being held accountable in those instances also.</p>

            <p>Exactly one century after Mr. Glen&#8217;s experience, in the summer of 1916, an American surgeon, Dr. Beaman Douglass, gathered a mess of mushrooms that he believed were of the genus panæolus, though the species remains uncertain. He, his wife, and the maid ate them, spreading the cooked mushrooms on toast. One hour later Mrs. Douglass developed psychic symptoms, and his followed shortly afterwards. Both lost their sense of balance and mental control. There was pronounced stimulation. Mrs. Douglass manifested &#8220;a tendency to be jolly, hilarious &#8212; she laughed and talked inordinately and foolishly.&#8221; As for Dr. Douglass, this is what he recalled, &#8220;I wished to be noisy, to laugh and joke. My own trivial remarks met with my own warm personal appreciation &#8230; Thoughts flew through my brain&#8230; Objects near seemed far away, sounds were diminished&#8230;&#8221; The maid underwent a similar experience. Six hours after eating and five hours after the first symptoms all evidence of intoxication had disappeared. At no time had there been nausea.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn11" id="cp5b14-r11">[11]</a></sup></p>

            <p>Mushrooms of the genus panæolus are found everywhere in the temperate and tropical zones, and there are many species. Henri Fabre knew them, of course, and we offer to our readers a reproduction of his painting of the panaeolus campanulatus. To us it seems outstanding in artistic composition, in the delicacy of the curves, the lilt of the caps. This mushroom is not normally eaten in France, but so far as we can learn it is not regarded as inebriating even by the mycophilic country folk of the Provence. There is no reason to think that Fabre considered it uncanny. Yet is there not something eerie about the cobra-curves of the little mushrooms in his painting, as though he sensed a secret?</p>

            <p>There is a reproach to mycologists in these unexplored hints and evidence of psychic effects caused by mushrooms, hints deeply rooted in Europe&#8217;s folkways, evidence clearly reported over centuries from Kamchatka, New Guinea, and Middle America. It seems strange that archaic peoples should still possess secrets of this kind that our laboratories have not exhaustively analyzed. Indeed, Swiss and English workers may lately have arrived, at last, on this exciting terrain for scientific inquiry. From the fungus known as <a name="ergot">ergot</a> Swiss pharmacologists have recently isolated an alkaloid that causes massive psychic reactions in human beings, including hallucinations that duplicate with astonishing fidelity the testimony of our old Spanish writers. Experiments with this alkaloid in England and America seem to open up promising vistas for its use in the treatment of psycho-neurotic disorders.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn12" id="cp5b14-r12">[12]</a></sup></p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">T</span>hat Dr. Reko and Dr. Schultes brought back a panæolus from their quests for the divinatory mushrooms was not the full answer to our problem. Were there not other divinatory species, belonging to different genera? Both Dr. Reko and Dr. Schultes thought so, and the former even obtained specimens of two other genera. Further questions suggested themselves, and we resolved to pursue our inquiry on our own account.</p>

            <p>In response to an inquiry of ours, Dr. Reko wrote us on February 12, 1953, that he had nothing further to add to the information he had published, but suggested that we address ourselves to a Miss Eunice Victoria Pike, an American linguistic student and Bible translator who had been living for many months each year since 1936 among the Mazatec Indians, with her headquarters in Huautla. She spoke Mazatec, he added, and thus she had access to the thoughts and feelings of the monolingual elements in the population. Immediately after thus introducing us to Miss Pike, Dr. Reko died. We wrote to her, and she has proved a most helpful and understanding correspondent. Even Miss Pike after all these years has never attended a performance of the divinatory rite, but speaking the language and living among the people, she reports the words of those who know and understand, and their words are more valuable than would be the uncomprehending testimony of an outsider witnessing the event. Is there anything more difficult than to enter intelligently into the inner religious experience of a people far removed culturally from one&#8217;s own; We reproduce in full Miss Pike&#8217;s letter to us, as a primary source on a theme of absorbing anthropological interest, superior by far in quality to anything on the <i>teo-nanácatl</i> given to us either by the early Spanish writers or recent inquirers. There is an immediacy of experience, an intimacy, about this report that carries its own proof of credibility.</p>

            <p>Here is Miss Pike&#8217;s letter:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p class="pull-right">
                    Huautla de Jiménez • Oaxaca, Mexico<br/>
                    March 9, 1953
                </p>

                <p>Dear Mr. Wasson:</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m glad to tell you whatever I can about the Mazatec mushroom. Some day I may write up my observations for publication, but in the meantime you may make what use of it you can.</p>

                <p>Mazatecs seldom talk about the mushroom to outsiders, but belief in it is widespread. A twenty-year old boy told me, &#8220;I know that outsiders don&#8217;t use the mushroom, but Jesus gave it to us because we are poor people and can&#8217;t afford a doctor and expensive medicine.&#8221;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn13" id="cp5b14-r13">[13]</a></sup></p>

                <p>Sometimes they refer to it as &#8216;the blood of Christ&#8217; because supposedly it grows only where a drop of Christ&#8217;s blood has fallen. They say that the land in this region is &#8216;living&#8217; because it will produce the mushroom, whereas the hot dry country where the mushroom will not grow is called &#8216;dead&#8217;.</p>

                <p>They say that it helps &#8216;good people&#8217; but if someone who is bad eats it, &#8216;it kills him or <a name="madness-1">makes him crazy</a>.&#8217; When they speak of &#8216;badness&#8217; they mean &#8216;ceremonially unclean&#8217;. (A murderer if he is ceremonially clean can eat the mushroom with no ill effects.) A person is considered safe if he refrains from intercourse five days before and after eating the mushroom. A shoemaker in our part of town went crazy about five years ago. The neighbours say it was because he ate the mushroom and then had intercourse with his wife.</p>

                <p>When a family decides to make use of the mushroom they tell their friends to bring them any they see, but they ask only those whom they can trust to refrain from intercourse at that time, for if the person who gathers the mushroom has had intercourse, it will make the person who eats it crazy.</p>

                <p>Usually it is not the sick person nor his family who eat the mushroom. They pay a &#8216;wiseman&#8217; to eat it and to tell them what the mushroom says. (He does so with a loud rhythmic chant.) The wiseman always eats the mushroom at night, because it &#8216;prefers to work unseen&#8217;. Usually he eats it about nine o&#8217;clock and it starts talking about a half an hour or an hour later. The Mazatecs speak of the mushroom as though it had a personality. They never say, &#8220;The wiseman said the mushroom said...&#8221; They always quote the mushroom direct.</p>

                <p>The wiseman always eats the mushroom raw; &#8220;If anyone cooks or burns the mushroom it will give them bad sores.&#8221; There is no specified number of how many he should eat, some wisemen eat more than others, usually they eat four or five. If he eats a lot, it &#8216;wants to kill him&#8217;. At such a time the wiseman falls down unconscious, and comes to little by little as the other people in the room &#8216;pray for him&#8217;. This may also happen &#8216;if he has had intercourse too recently&#8217;.</p>

                <p>When all goes well, the wiseman <a name="divination-4">sees visions</a> and the mushroom talks about two or three hours. &#8220;It is Jesus Christ himself who talks to us!&#8221; The mushroom tells them what made the person sick. He may say the person was bewitched; if so, he tells who did it, why, and how. He may say the person has &#8216;fear sickness&#8217;. He may say it is a sickness curable by medicine and suggest that the person call a doctor.</p>

                <p>More important, he will tell whether or not the person is going to live or die. If he says he will live, then &#8220;he gets better even though he has been very sick&#8221;. If he says he will die, then the family start making arrangements for the funeral and he tells who should inherit his property. (One of my informants admitted, however, that the mushroom occasionally makes mistakes.)</p>

                <p>One of the &#8220;proofs&#8221; that it is &#8220;Jesus Christ himself&#8221; who talks to them is that anyone who eats the mushroom sees visions. Everyone we have asked suggests that they are seeing into heaven itself. They don&#8217;t insist on that point, and as an alternative they suggest that they are seeing moving pictures of the U.S.A. Most of them agree that the wisemen frequently see the ocean and for these mountain people that is exciting.</p>

                <p>I have asked what the wiseman looks like while under influence of the mushroom. They say that he is not sleeping, he is sitting up, with his eyes open, &#8220;awake&#8221;. They say he does not drink liquor at the time, but that he may in the morning. Some of them go right out to work the next day, but some stay home and sleep &#8220;because they have been awake all night&#8221;.</p>

                <p>Although we have never been present when the mushroom was eaten, we have observed the influence it has on the people. One of our neighbors had tuberculosis and was coming to us for medical help. Then one night they called in the wiseman to eat the mushroom in his behalf. It told them that he would die.</p>

                <p>The next day the patient no longer had any interest in our medicines; instead he began to set affairs in order for death. He quit eating solid food, restricting himself to corn gruel. About two weeks later he refused even gruel, accepting only an occasional sip of water. A few days later even water was rejected. In less than a month after he had consulted the mushroom he was dead.</p>

                <p>Another neighboring family had a series of sicknesses. They consulted the mushroom for their twenty-two year old son. The mushroom said he would get better, and he did. When their eighteen-year old daughter became ill, they consulted the mushroom. It said she would get better and she did.</p>

                <p>Then the ten year old daughter became ill. The mushroom said that this one would die. The family were amazed because her illness had not seemed serious. Of course they were grief stricken, but the mushroom said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be concerned, I&#8217;ll take her soul to be with me.&#8221; So, following her mother&#8217;s instructions the little girl prayed to the thing talking to her, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t want to cure me, take my soul.&#8221; A day or two later she was dead.</p>

                <p>Not all the Mazatecs believe that the mushroom&#8217;s messages are from Jesus Christ. Those who speak Spanish and have had contact with the outside world are apt to declare, &#8220;It&#8217;s just a lot of lies&#8217;.&#8220; Most monolinguals, however, will either declare that it is Jesus Christ who speaks to them, or they will ask a little doubting, &#8220;What do you say, is it true that it is the blood of Jesus?&#8221;</p>

                <p>I regret the survival of the use of the mushroom, for we know of no case in which it has had beneficial results. I wish they&#8217;d consult the Bible when they seek out Christ&#8217;s wishes, and not be deceived by a &#8216;wiseman&#8217; and the mushrooms.</p>

                <p>In answer to your questions:</p>

                <p>The mushroom (called <i>ši<sup>3</sup>tho<sup>3</sup></i>, or affectionately <i>&#8217;nti<sup>1</sup> ši<sup>3</sup>tho<sup>3</sup>)</i> is brown in color and grows biggest in June and July when the rainfall is heaviest. At that time they may be four inches across and about four inches tall. They are still plentiful in September and October. By March and April, the dry season, the mushroom is scarce, but small ones may still be found.</p>

                <p>The mushroom grows in the grass, but when people are hunting for it, they look first in the places where cattle have been, because the mushroom is most frequently found growing out of cow manure.</p>

                <p>They do not dry the mushroom. If they cannot find one growing, they go without. The person I asked doubted that it was possible to dry them. At first she thought they would not. Then she said that maybe they could be dried, but she doubted that they would serve as medicine that way.</p>

                <p>I do not know that the Mazatecs ever use the mushroom in connection with a fiesta. For the most part it is used in connection with sickness. I have heard of one other minor use however. They say a man may slip a piece into an enemy&#8217;s liquor while he is drinking in a saloon. If he drinks it while ceremonially unclean, he may go crazy. Or he might go crazy because the man who gathered it was ceremonially unclean. Wishing you success with your research,</p>

                <p class="pull-right">
                    Sincerely,<br/>
                    (<i>Signed</i>) Eunice V. Pike</p>

            <p>Miss Pike&#8217;s letter settled one question for us. For some time we had been considering a visit to Huautla. Now we were resolved to make it. Much of her information was of that precious kind which can only be obtained when one speaks with the Indians in their own language on terms of long standing friendship and complete mutual confidence. We could not hope to improve on her contribution. But there were many unanswered questions. For one thing, her mushrooms reached four inches in diameter; they could not belong to the genus panæolus. What then were they?</p>

            <p>In the Mazatec country there are two seasons of the year when mushrooms should be abundant, at the beginning and at the end of the rains, in June and in the first half of August. We decided on August for our trip. Miss Pike would be absent then, but her colleague in Mexico City, Mrs. George Cowan, proficient in Mazatec and intimate with Huautla, would know how to help us get there. We also were successful in exciting the interest of Mr. Weitlaner, who agreed to accompany us. This was our greatest stroke of fortune, for with his knowledge of the country and the Indians, at least some measure of success was assured. Our objectives were simple: to obtain specimens of the sacred mushrooms, for purposes of identification and trial consumption by ourselves, to learn about the present state of the cult, and to attend the mushroom rite.</p>

            <p>We set out from Mexico City on Saturday morning, August 8, 1953. Apart from the chauffeur we were four &#8212; Robert Weitlaner, whom we shall call hereafter Don Roberto, VPW, RGW, and our sixteen year old daughter Masha. On that day we drove through Puebla to Tehuacán, a watering resort, where we dismissed the car and spent the night. On Sunday we took the train to San Antonio, about two hours away, and from the mournful railroad station reeking in the torrid heat of a semi-arid countryside we drove a mile or so in a ramshackle bus, loaded with Spanish-speaking Indians and their worldly goods, over the worst road in the world to Teotitlán del Camino, a bustling market town and the stepping off place for the Mazatec country. We spent Sunday night there, in the inn kept by Julia Martínez, a woman unforgettably obese. Early the next morning Victor Hernández was at the door with six animals, five mules and a horse, all of them miserably small and thin. He was a Mazatec from Huautla who spoke a fair amount of Spanish. He had come for us in response to a telegram that Mrs. Cowan had sent to a friend in Huautla, the school teacher Herlinda Martínez Cid. Our belongings in duffle bags and knapsacks were soon loaded, and off we started up the steep trail into the mountains east of Teotitlán. After two hours of climbing we reached San Bernardino, a village superbly perched on a mountain spur looking back over the hot low country that we had left behind. There we breakfasted on tortillas and beans and then off we went again, on a long steady climb until we arrived at the first of the passes, known as La Cumbre, perhaps 9,000 feet high. Here we thought to stop for a bite to eat from our provisions, but Victor would not hear of it. He said the Cumbre was a favorite spot for robbers, who would beset the wayfarers on animals spent from the long climb and then vanish in any of various directions down the slopes. We noticed for the first time that Victor was armed with a revolver at his waist. Later we learned that four robbers, many years before, had been hanged on the Curnbre, and their bodies left swinging for months in that desolate wind-swept place. And so we hurried on down into the next valley, and up again to a second pass, and down again, and finally up the last steep climb into the town of Huautla, itself perched on a mountain side at an altitude ranging from 5,500 to 6,000 feet. We had been on the road for eleven hours through country of wild grandeur, the mountains covered with vegetation, with only two or three thatched villages discerned in the distance. But on the trail itself there had been considerable traffic, as strings of animals kept passing us, laden with sacks of coffee and other produce bound for the market in Teotitlán. Like our Victor, the drivers were all on foot, barefoot or wearing sandals, hurrying along at a dogtrot. Their animals gave us some trouble in the narrow way, as the beasts, stepping along, would brush us with their heavy sacks and push us uncomfortably toward the precipitous outer edge of the path. Victor observed our difficulty, and soon it dawned on us that on-coming drivers were halting their animals and letting us pass. Victor had been notifying them of our approach and bespoken their consideration. He had not uttered a word, or so we thought. But we had read, in preparation for our trip, about the Mazatecs, and knew that the language could be whistled as well as spoken. Yes, in a well-modulated, penetrating whistle Victor had been conversing about us with the on-coming muleteers, even before they would come around a bend into view, and at his request they were letting us pass!</p>

            <p>At the end of the day, as night was falling, we walked our animals slowly up through the town of Huautla, across the public plaza, up the hill to the house where Herlinda was waiting for us, standing in her door and smiling at us.</p>

            <p>We were tired out, and the warm reception that this Indian school-teacher cheered us with was most welcome. That night we all slept on the packed-earth floor of one of her three rooms. Herlinda&#8217;s aged mother lay moaning, critically ill, in the front room. On the following day we rented a new, unoccupied house nearby, paying five pesos (or fifty-five U.S. cents) for a week&#8217;s use. There we also slept on the ground, and we had our meals with Herlinda, who stayed home from school to take care of us. From Victor and others during our stay we heard stories of the lawlessness of these Mazatec Indians, and it is true that no one goes abroad after nightfall, whether on the trails from one town to another or within the town itself; and armed with their machetes the Indians looked to us fearsome enough, when we would meet them on the road. But the fact is that they treated us always with perfect courtesy and gentleness, and those few whose aid we sought in confidence in our mushroomic inquiries were most understanding in their efforts to help us.</p>

            <p>The Mazatec Indians number about 60,000, all of them concentrated in the mountains of north central Oaxaca. They live chiefly in villages, though some dwell on their farms. There is a distinctive Mazatec style of house &#8212; by tradition a rectangular roof of thatch supported on posts, with walls made of thin boards or adobe filling in the space between the posts. The gable roofs are invariably constructed with a thatch overhang at each end of the ridge pole, the overhang strikingly suggestive of the ear of an English sheepdog. The Mazatecs are short and stocky; many of the women still wear the embroidered <i>huipil</i> (&#8217;blouse&#8217;) that is the ancestral dress of the Indians of Mexico and Guatemala. Of animals they breed only goats, and they live primarily by farming, with maize and beans their staple foods, supplemented by sweet potatoes and all the fruits common in the tropics and sub-tropics, along with chickens and turkeys. Coffee is their cash crop, and the coffee of Huautla is one of the finest in the world. Their language is wholly unrelated to Nahuatl or Zapotec. It is one of a family of four languages, Mazatec, Chocho, Ixcatec and Popoloca, all having branched off supposedly from an ancestral stock in the order in which we have listed them.</p>

            <p>Of these four languages, Ixcatec is spoken in only one town, Santa María de Ixcatlán. Popoloca must be distinguished from another language, called sometimes Popoluca and sometimes Popoloca de Vera Cruz, which belongs to the Mije-Zoque group. In classic Nahuatl the word <i>popoloca</i> was a contemptuous epithet for any tongue considered barbarian by the Nahua, and this is how the term came to be permanently applied to two unrelated Indian languages. &#8216;Mazatec&#8217; is not a designation for himself that the Mazatec uses. It is the outsider&#8217;s term, derived from the Mazatec town of Mazatlán. The Mazatec is apt to call himself by the name of the town where he is born and lives.</p>

            <p>The distinctive feature of Mazatec, and indeed of many other languages of the Oaxaca cultural mosaic, is the tonal system. In Mazatec the pitch at which successive syllables are uttered is of primary semantic importance. This is what makes communication by whistling or humming simple. The Chinese is a tonal language too, but the &#8216;contour&#8217; tones of Chinese are basically different from the &#8216;registered&#8217; tones of constant pitch in the language of the Mazatecs. When the Mazatec muleteer initiates a whistled conversation with a friend some distance away, the key that he adopts sets the key for his friend&#8217;s answer and the whole conversation follows in that key. Anything that can be said in the language can be said whistling. Mrs. Johnson had sent by us some trinkets &#8212; earrings, a ring, a bracelet &#8212; to an Indian godchild of hers, living outside the village of San Andrés, a few miles from Huautla. With Victor we walked thither along the ancient mountain path. He found the Indian cottage, high above the path. He tilted his head far back, and in a pleasant whistled discourse explained the circumstances &#8212; certainly unusual ones for this isolated Indian family. Soon there were signs of activity above, and down a precipitous footpath came three women &#8212; the grandmother, the mother, and the child herself, now sixteen. The grandmother and mother were bearing simple homespun textiles across their forearms, a gift to send back to Mrs. Johnson in exchange for her remembrance. None of the women knew a word of Spanish, and after a brief conversation through Victor as our interpreter, we withdrew, the women raising their hands, palms turned to us at shoulder level, and bowing us a friendly and moving farewell. By Victor&#8217;s whistling they had learned exactly who had come to call and why, and they came down to greet us on the path equipped with reciprocal gifts, not to be outdone by our courtesy. There is a curious convention in Mazatec whistling: though women understand it and know how to do it, a rule of behavior makes it improper for a woman to whistle in public.</p>

            <p>Huautla is a town with several thousand inhabitants. It could not be more beautifully situated, on a mountain side in a theater of verdant mountains, bathed in flowers and sub-tropical vegetation, free of mosquitoes by reason of the altitude. It is a bustling market town, full of movement and life. Yet most of the population speaks only a tongue that, until now, has never been written, and those few who know Spanish often know only a smattering of it. Most Mazatecs never sleep in a bed, rolling themselves in their sarapes on a mat on the beaten earth in their houses. Most of them have never worn shoes. Victor could not read time by a clock-face. Except in Huautla where there are wheelbarrows, there is no wheeled vehicle in the Mazatec country, and until a road thrusts itself through the mountains to this remote Mazatec world, most Mazatecs will continue to live and die without using the wheel. How strange to come upon a people remote from the modern world, still shut in by their mountains and the barrier of their difficult language, where we can see&#8217; how our own ancestors lived for most of human history, living almost solely in and for the present, but pursuant to patterns transmitted orally from one generation to another, a people abounding in vitality, intelligent, yet still largely untouched by the currents of the modern world!</p>

            <p>At breakfast on the morrow after our arrival Don Roberto and RGW took Herlinda into their confidence and told her the purpose of our visit. She admitted that she, like her neighbors, had wondered why we were coming. A close friend of Victoria Pike and Florence Cowan, she had no faith in the sacred mushrooms, but she said she would ask her brother-in-law, Aurelio Carreras, widower of her late sister, to help us. He turned out to be a one-eyed Indian, about 45 years old, the owner of two or three houses built around a patio almost next door. He had learned Spanish from his wife, but could not read or write it. We bespoke his help to get the sacred mushrooms for us, and he promised to do his best, but the rains had ended prematurely and the mushrooms might be hard to find. He warned us to discuss the mushrooms with no one.</p>

            <p>We walked through the town. Don Roberto dropped in at a little general store, and introduced RGW to the ancient woman behind the counter, Cleofas Cid, an aunt of Herlinda&#8217;s. When no other customers were about, he asked her whether she could find the mushrooms for us. She told us that the <i>curandero</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn14" id="cp5b14-r14">[14]</a></sup> who had officiated for the party in 1938 had died, and she knew not where to turn for another who would accommodate us, but there was Concepcion, the wife of a <i>curandero</i> who had taken to drink and gone to the dogs. She knew the mushrooms and would get them for us. Concepcion did not speak a word of Spanish.</p>
            
            <p>When approaching the Indians with our inquiries, we were careful to speak of the mushrooms with the deepest respect. (After all, it was a bold thing that we were doing, strangers probing the innermost religious secrets of this remote people. How would a Christian priest receive a pagan&#8217;s request for samples of the Host?)</p>

            <p>On Wednesday word reached us from the priest of the huge church on the plaza that he would like to see us. We had already paid a courtesy visit on the Presidente, a big, tough-looking cacique who spoke good Spanish. Now we called on Father Alfonso Aragón. He turned out to be Indian, but Zapotec not Mazatec, and with most of his parishioners he could not converse. (In man&#8217;s memory there had never been a Mazatec priest in Huautla.) He was curious about our visit. We explained our interest in the old customs of the Mazatecs, and then on his initiative he told us of the strange faith, ridiculous in his eyes, that the townspeople placed in certain mushrooms. Lately a physician in Puebla had asked him to forward a kilogram of them. Father Alfonso had succeeded in laying his hands on the mushrooms, and had wrapped them up. The parcel was still there, on the shelf in front of us, for he had lost the address of the Puebla physician. Did we care to examine them? We did not conceal our interest, and quickly untied the parcel. Alas, as was to be expected, the contents were reduced to a black and putrid mass.</p>

            <p>We talked with Victor the muleteer about the mushrooms, and how we hoped we could consult a <i>curandero</i> in the course of our visit, and he set off full of promises, saying he would seek out either of two <i>curanderos</i> whom he knew in San Andrés.</p>

            <p>Then we waited.</p>

            <p>And as we waited, we picked up more and more information about the sacred mushrooms. Herlinda talked freely with us. She knew much, though she professed to have little knowledge and certainly she had no faith in them. Victor the muleteer was captivated by our interest. He and Aurelio and Concepcion would come to us separately, often after dark, Aurelio and Concepcion with little parcels of a few mushrooms wrapped in banana leaves or a cloth, which they would deliver to us secretively and reverently. Aurelio and Victor would warn us to speak of the matter to no one, for it was <i>muy delicado</i>, &#8216;very perilous&#8217;. This was the expression they used independently of each other, for we talked with them always individually, but in the case of Concepción, as she was monolingual, we had to bring in Herlinda to interpret for us.</p>

            <p>We learned that the Mazatecs are mycophagous and many kinds of edible mushrooms are offered on market day in the plaza. Each has its own name and the general word for &#8216;mushroom&#8217; is <i>tai<sup>3</sup></i>, the <i>t</i> being explosive and each of the vowels being nasalized.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn15" id="cp5b14-r15">[15]</a></sup> But this word embraces only mushrooms other than the sacred ones. Each of the sacred kinds has its own name, and all together they are called <i>ši<sup>3</sup>to<sup>3</sup></i>. This name is invariably preceded by another verbal element so that the normal expression is, as Miss Pike had told us, <i>&#8217;nti<sup>1</sup> ši<sup>3</sup>to<sup>3</sup></i>, the first syllable conveying a sense of deference and affection. (The apostrophe represents a glottal stop.) The word <i>ši<sup>3</sup>to<sup>3</sup></i> means literally &#8216;that which springs forth&#8217;, and while it is impossible for us to prove that this sense explains the name, in the context of the sacred mushrooms it is a felicitous mystical metaphor. Victor explained the name as meaning &#8220;<a name="divine-generation-1">that which comes of itself</a>, no one knows whence, like the wind that comes without our knowing whence nor why&#8221; &#8212; <i>que viene por sí mismo, no se sabe de dónde, como el viento que viene sin saber de dónde ni porqué</i>. The word is saturated with <i>mana</i>: it is uttered in a whisper and Victor was loath to pronounce it at all; when he had to use it, he would substitute a gesture &#8212; his gathered fingers making an eating motion before his mouth.</p>

            <p>In the Mazatec language there seems to be no name for the occupation of the shaman or <i>curandero</i>. In the proper context one speaks of him as &#8216;he who knows&#8217;, <i>čo<sup>4</sup>ta<sup>4</sup>či<sup>4</sup>ne<sup>4</sup></i>. Only on his advice should one eat the sacred mushrooms. The <i>curandero</i> himself does not necessarily gather the mushrooms; others may do this for him. Nor is the gathering attended by prayers and vigils. But according to Concepcion the best time to find them in good condition is early in the morning &#8220;when the air is fresh&#8221; &#8212; <i>con el fresco</i> &#8212; a turn of phrase that reminds us of the &#8216;little breeze before dawn&#8217; that Jacinto de la Serna mentioned. The best time to find them is when the moon is new &#8212; <i>la luna tierna</i>. According to Aurelio, in and around Huautla there are today about twenty or thirty <i>curanderos</i>, roughly the same number as in the past, and women are as acceptable as men in this function. Usually the <i>curandero</i> takes in hand the instruction of his son or relative who will succeed him, but this presents no problem, for the neophyte learns in two or three months. After all, it is the mushroom that speaks, the mushroom that teaches the beginner what to say and do. The rite of the sacred mushroom is performed only as an <i>ad hoc</i> consultation, and the prevailing fee when we were in Huautla was from twenty to twenty-five pesos, from $2.50 to $3.00. For this service the <i>curandero</i> must fast from noon to noon, and drink no alcohol. He must be (ceremonially) clean, <i>nta<sup>3</sup>čo<sup>4</sup>ta<sup>4</sup></i>. He begins his session between nine and ten o&#8217;clock in the evening, and does not finish before three in the morning. But the trance leaves no unhappy after-effects. He can work the next day, and his head is so clear that he remembers all that he has said in the course of the night.</p>

            <p>The <i>curandero</i> eats the mushrooms raw and unwashed and preferably fresh, but he may conserve them in a dried state for as long as six months. The <i>curandero</i> eats the mushrooms near the beginning of the séance, and at his discretion he may offer them to the family who is in attendance or to the patient whose fate is in the balance. Among our informants we found no one who had ever heard of a public communal feast of sacred mushrooms. This feature of the cult, so eloquently described by the old writers, seems obsolete. Here is an important alteration in the old customs, and for the change two explanations suggest themselves, either of which would be sufficient of itself. For public celebrations the mushroom could hardly stand the competition of distilled alcohol, and the unhappy addiction of the Mazatecs today to strong liquor is sufficient evidence of this. But there may be another reason. We know that from the earliest times the Catholic Church exerted itself to the utmost to extirpate the mushroom cult, and under that threat the use of the mushroom would be driven into hiding. Indeed this may be the forgotten but once powerful motive behind the atmosphere of secrecy that hung over all our discussions during our brief sojourn in Huautla, and what on its face looks like a reverential tabu may be merely a legacy of persecution.</p>

            <p>How shall we convey the sense of gravity and doom that seemed to hang on Aurelio&#8217;s words when he would whisper to us about the sacred mushrooms in the evening? The mushroom itself &#8216;is speech&#8217;, <i>es habla</i>, he would say, and it speaks of many things, of God, of the future, of life and death, and also it tells where to find things that are lost. One sees everything, one sees where God is also &#8212; <i>se ve todo; se ve donde está Dios también</i>. These were our good friend Aurelio&#8217;s very words. We discovered that it is usual to talk of these mushrooms in pairs. The <i>curanderos</i> use four kinds, and each kind has its valence, so to speak, measuring its potency, and the <i>curandero</i> eats so many pairs of this kind, and a different number of pairs of another; or in case of a shortage, he can use two or more kinds, calculating the valence of each to arrive at the right dose. We discovered also that each of the four kinds has various specific names, and not all of our informants knew all of these names, but each was certain in his own mind of his own names. It is as though in a single community of a few thousand souls there were various oral traditions using different names, and the traditions did not intermingle and coalesce. On the last day of our stay in Huautla, Victor arranged for us to pay a visit to Teodoro García, and it was obvious to us from his installation and bearing that he was a &#8216;fashionable&#8217; <i>curandero</i>. He told us he was a native of Huautla, yet later we learned from Herlinda and Aurelio that neither had ever heard of him, and Herlinda suggested that he must hail from San Lucas, a Mazatec village some distance away speaking a dialect different from the dialect of Huautla. More probably &#8216;Teodoro García&#8217; was a fictitious name, invented on the spur of the moment. For the Mazatec his name is part of his very being. He is loath to disclose it, for he thereby places himself in the other person&#8217;s power.</p>
            
            <p>It was interesting to watch the behavior of our Indian friends as one by one they would talk to us about the mushrooms lying on the table before us in the shelter of our house. Victor would hold them to his nose and sniff them, and then report how much <i>gaz</i> the specimens contained. Aurelio would say of the little ones that they had a higher rating &#8212; <i>tenían mas grados</i> &#8212; than the larger ones. They would tell us how many pair were to be eaten of each kind, and the maximum that a strong man might cope with. They told us the specific names for each kind, and from the variety of these it was clear that the names were euphemistic escapes, metaphors rather than names, metaphors expressing respect and affection. As soon as our friends would leave us, we would lay out the specimens, some to be photographed, and all of them to be either dried and packed in cotton batting or else sealed in bottles with a formalin solution. In the course of our expeditions to Mexico we have collected hallucinatory mushrooms of many species, belonging to four genera. Professor Heim has defined them mycologically in the <i>Comptes rendus</i> of the Académie des Sciences, Institut de France, vol. 242, pp. 965-8 and 1385-95, sessions of March 12 and February 20, 1956. Here we add only these notes on the kinds used in Huautla.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Our Huautla specimens included many small mushrooms, some with black and others with purple-brown spores. The Indians esteem them highly and the <i>curandero</i> will take up to 15 or 20 pair. They grow in pastures and in the vicinity of dung but not in dung. They belong to various species but the Indians do not distinguish among them myco logically. In Spanish they are called <a name="angelitos"><i>angelitos</i></a>; in Mazatec <i>&#8217;nti<sup>1</sup> ši<sup>3</sup>tho<sup>3</sup> ni<sup>4</sup>se<sup>3&#8217;4</sup></i>, of which the distinguishing final element means &#8216;<a name="bird">bird</a>&#8217;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn16" id="cp5b14-r16">[16]</a></sup></li>

                <li>Stropharia sp. This is the largest of the hallucinatory mushrooms used in Huautla, and the least esteemed. It grows directly out of cow&#8217;s dung. In Spanish it is called the <i>honguillo de San Isidro Labrador</i>, the little mushroom of <a name="st-isidore-3">St. Isidore</a> the Plowman. In Mazatec, Concepción called it the sacred mushroom of the bull&#8217;s dung, <i>&#8217;nti<sup>1</sup> ši<sup>3</sup>tho<sup>3</sup> y&#8217;e<sup>4</sup>le<sup>4</sup> nca<sup>4</sup>ha<sup>4</sup></i>. Concepción added that inasmuch as these grow in dung and the first kind around but not in dung, people say in Mazatec that these two kinds talk to each other. (See Fig. A).</li>

                <li>Psilocybe sp. This is an ochraceous spored agaric. It is called in Mazatec <i>&#8217;nti<sup>1</sup> ši<sup>3</sup>tho<sup>3</sup> ki<sup>3</sup>šo<sup>1</sup></i>, the &#8216;<a name="landslide-1">landslide</a>&#8217;.</li>

                <li>We were told repeatedly that another kind of mushroom growing on dead or dying trees is used, but we saw no specimens nor could we arrive at the native name.</li>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">A</span>s the days went by we felt increasingly disappointed that we were not amassing an abundance of the sacred mushrooms. The early ending of the rains had made them scarce. RGW depleted our precious store by eating three of the small ones and one of the large, but more could not be spared. Bitter to the taste, they were not sufficient to cause psychic symptoms.</p>

            <p>We were even more disappointed by our inability to meet any of the <i>curanderos</i> and to engage one to perform the ritual for us. Our Mazatec friends seemed slow to bring us into contact with them. Apparently the initial pourparlers had to be conducted through an intermediary. At any rate, for days no one gave us so much as the name of one, and our friends spoke of them like real but rather mysterious characters who forever remained off stage. Here again there is perhaps a legacy of the era of persecution. Twice Victor disappointed us. He announced to us that first one and later another <i>curandero</i> of San Andrés would minister to us, for a fee somewhat larger than the standard one. In each, case the <i>curandero</i> failed to keep the engagement.</p>

            <p>To justify the ministrations of a <i>curandero</i>, the suppliant must present a specific problem on which he needs the advice of the divinatory mushroom. We had resolved that our problem lay in our anxiety over our 18 year old son Peter, working in an industrial plant outside Boston, from whom no news had reached us (naturally enough) since we had left home a few days before. This was not a good excuse, but it was the best we could conjure up and it seemed legitimate to our Indian friends.</p>

            <p>Our itinerary was going to compel us to leave Huautla not later than Sunday morning the 16<sup>th</sup>. Saturday came, and we still had failed in our efforts to engage a <i>curandero</i>. At that point a brilliant idea came to Don Roberto: was it possible that Aurelio himself, our one-eyed Indian friend, was a <i>čo<sup>4</sup>ta<sup>4</sup>či<sup>4</sup>ne<sup>4</sup></i>? Hardly had Don Roberto advanced this conjecture than Aurelio himself came into view, his sarape over his shoulder, approaching us discreetly with that quiet measured gait that by now we knew so well. We felt indebted to him for all he had done for us. Now the big test was to come. We chatted with him, and then, quite casually, Don Roberto asked:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>&#8220;And tell us, Aurelio, when you give treatments [<i>hace curaciones</i>], are they successful?&#8221;</p>
                <p>&#8220;Yes&#8221;, he answered, &#8220;always.&#8221;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>For days we had been talking with a <i>curandero</i> all unawares.</p>

            <p>Don Roberto went right on. &#8220;Will you help us tonight?&#8221; Aurelio hesitated. He needed time to think the matter over. Why was he undecided? Was he perhaps ceremonially unclean? Was it because we were aliens to him and his people? Or was it because Herlinda&#8217;s mother lay dying in the house and he was not in the mood? He went away and consulted Herlinda. This she told us later, explaining that her mother&#8217;s condition was what had held him back, but she had advised him that we had come from afar, in need of the secret of his people, and he should help us. He came back to us, and told us to be ready at 9 o&#8217;clock in the evening. Then he went on to explain to us that different <i>curanderos</i> had different styles in performing the ritual. Some chant and sing and even shout. His own style, he said, was simple: he always remained composed and never raised his voice. But the mushroom speaks only in Mazatec, and he would have to have his son Demetrio with him. to interpret the mushroom&#8217;s words for us. Before leaving us he obtained our assurance that we would discuss the matter with no outsiders in Huautla.</p>

            <p>On the dot of 9 o&#8217;clock that evening Aurelio called for us, just as the last rays of daylight were vanishing. He led us by a short-cut across a corn patch or <i>milpa</i> to his houses, and we entered the door that he led us to. For hours we were to remain in the little room, perhaps eight feet square, where we now found ourselves. In front of us was a kind of shelf or mantel or altar. On the right there was a crudely carpentered wooden bedstead. Under it lay two small children, Aristeo and Julia Elvira, sleeping on a mat. Someone gently pulled the mat with them on it over the dirt floor to the other side of the partition that bisected the house. We were four in our own party. Then there was Aurelio and his grown-up son Demetrio (Figure B, 1), and Demetrio&#8217;s young and pretty wife Clara (2), who lay on the floor in her clothes and wrapped in her sarape, and who seemed to doze through the night. Next to her lay her baby, born on June 4 and still nameless, for she was as yet unbaptized. Clara seemed to doze, but when her husband Demetrio faltered in translating the words of the mushroom, she had a way of interposing the Spanish words that he was seeking. We were eight in all, with the two children around the corner making ten. The setting for us&#8217; strangers had its unusual aspects. Throughout the long ceremony the only illumination inside the room came from tapers or an oil wick, and sometimes from a single taper, and for more than an hour we sat in complete darkness and silence. The air grew foul, for the bean-eating Indians are not an inhibited people. After n o&#8217;clock a terrifying rain storm with thunder and lightning broke on Huautla, and through the knot-holes and chinks of the flimsy board walls of our hut the lightning would suddenly reveal every detail of the room and the huddled figures in it. After the storm ended there was more excitement. A shot was fired in the night and Demetrio cried out, &#8220;<i>Un homicidio</i>&#8221; -a murder! Then there was the running of naked feet in the path outside our house, a loud knocking at a door not far away, and three more shots, but not a single human voice. Throughout the storm and the shooting Aurelio proceeded deliberately with the ritual.</p>

            <p>With Aurelio&#8217;s permission Don Roberto and RGW were taking notes, Roberto&#8217;s being especially full and accurate. The following description is based on the notes that we both took. The successive steps seemed interminable, so slow were they, but each was executed with nice care for detail. There were knots to be tied, and then Aurelio sought the aid of his son, doubtless because his single eye made the tying too difficult. We shall describe the ritual as accurately as we can, and analogies with other religions may occur to the reader at certain points, especially when the mushrooms are consumed. But need we warn him that such analogies and correspondences are superficial; Students of religious rituals often observe similar gestures and acts in unrelated religions. The similarity is accidental. A given ritual is stamped with meaning by the myths, the theology, the creed, the emotional responses, the whole cosmology peculiar to the culture that has evolved it. The ritual of the divinatory mushroom must be interpreted against the background of all the religious beliefs and practices of the Indians of Middle America, an absorbing subject far too complex and difficult for us to cope with. Though we could not enter into the subjective associations that the ritual evokes in Mazatec believers, it was easy for us to perceive the mystery that bathes each successive step in the ceremony. For us as mycophiles and ethno-mycologists it was a stirring event to see our Mazatec <i>curandero</i> reverently raise the mushrooms from the cloth, pair after pair, a mushroom in either hand held by the stipe; and then see him eat the pair, first one and then the other, beginning with the pileus and then the greater part of the stipe, masticating each mouthful of the fresh raw mushroom a long time and then swallowing it, and depositing the stub of the stipe carefully in a piece of paper on one side. Yes, the <i>curandero</i> eats first one mushroom and then the other, holding one of the pair in either hand, exactly as the illustrator represented the act in the Magliabechiano manuscript. What we saw confirmed the meaning of that picture. What we saw was consistent with the hearsay accounts of the ritual handed down to us by Motolinía and Jacinto de la Serna. It confirmed in all essentials the account given by the late Jean Bassett Johnson of the performance that he and his party attended in Huautla on the night of July 16, 1938, fifteen years and one month before our experience.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">H</span>ere then is the order of the ritual of the divinatory mushroom as we witnessed and recorded it in Huautla de Jiménez. Our drawings were made by Robert Weitlaner, and we are grateful to him for allowing us to use them and his notes. Our plate in color giving an impressionistic grouping of the accessories of the rite was done by VPW.</p>

            <p>Though the room has a kind of altar, the entire ritual takes place on the floor, with Aurelio seated most of the time on a small, low stool (Figure B, 4). Later, when he consumes the mushrooms, he is kneeling on his folded sarape. In front of the altar and slightly to the right of center, he begins by laying a sack on the ground, and on it a square of cheap yellow sateen, and on top of this another layer of heavier material, dark blue, probably from a <i>rebozo</i> or shawl (3). We are lighted at first by a wick in an oil tin. Someone brings in a few glowing embers, which are placed in an old potsherd on the ground between the altar and the blue material. From first to last, except for the utterances and the long silences, the ritual consists of the ceremonial handling of accessories that are laid out on the blue cloth. Of these accessories all save the mushrooms can be seen for sale in the market place every day and are familiar to students of Middle American religious practices. These accessories are:<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn17" id="cp5b14-r17">[17]</a></sup></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Lumps of copal, a pale resin used as incense.</li>
                <li>A handful of cacao beans.</li>
                <li>A handful of maize kernels. (The precise number in our case is 53.)</li>
                <li>A heap of <i>pisiete</i> &#8212; ground green tobacco.</li>
                <li>Four hen&#8217;s eggs.</li>
                <li>Two speckled <i>guajolote</i> (Mexican turkey) eggs.</li>
                <li>Two brilliant feathers of the <i>guacamaya</i> bird, a kind of parrot.</li>
                <li>Six rolls of bark paper, called <i>amate.</i></li>
                <li>Also tapers of virgin wax.</li>
            </ol>

            <figure>
                <img alt="" src="../Images/index-60_1.jpg" />
            </figure>
            
            <p>These with fourteen pair of mushrooms make up the accessories, and initially they are laid out on the blue material as shown in Figure C. Aurelio takes a long time to arrange all this. He counts the mushrooms and the cacao beans, and then places five cacao beans next to each hen&#8217;s egg and 13 next to each of the two turkey eggs. He divides the maize kernels roughly in half, picks up half, shakes them from hand to hand, casts them on the cloth, contemplates them, repeats the same steps with the other half, and separates out the two grains that he says are the Wasson children. He asks whether we are in agreement with what goes on and we say yes. He casts the kernels again, and a third time. Speaking of Peter, Aurelio says, in Demetrio&#8217;s translation, <i>&#8220;Está, pero ¿quién sabe donde esta?&#8221;</i> &#8212; He is, but who knows where he is? It is now 10.15 o&#8217;clock.</p>

            <figure>
                <img alt="" src="../Images/index-61_1.jpg" />
            </figure>

            <p>To each of us he gives a piece of <i>copal</i> to hold in a clenched fist, and to VPW he gives two, one for Peter; then on his bidding we toss the copal into the embers glowing in the potsherd.</p>

            <p>Aurelio kneels on his folded <i>sarape</i>, crosses himself, invokes the Trinity and some of the saints, takes a pair of mushrooms, holds them briefly over the burning copal, and begins to chew them. Now only a single taper is burning, aided by light from the embers. After chewing for a time, he swallows, and then does the same with the rest of the mushrooms, pair by pair, until 14 pair are consumed. He finishes eating them at 10.30 o&#8217;clock. He has now eaten u pair of the large ones and three pair of the others. Having finished the mushrooms, he binds his head tightly in a kerchief.</p>

            <p>Throughout the night Aurelio&#8217;s utterances are in a conversational tone, in Mazatec for the most part but toward the end in Spanish. VPW, being a physician, has arrived in Huautla equipped to examine the <i>curandero</i> during the performance with stethoscope, thermometer, blood-pressure gauge, and ophthalmoscope. Now that the moment has come, for many reasons each alone sufficient it seems hardly wise to inject these extraneous and exotic utensils into the proceedings. Aurelio breathes heavily and audibly, and his single eye often disappears for long stretches behind its closed lid. Aurelio&#8217;s whole demeanor expresses concentration of mental effort. From first to last he manifests no unmistakable symptoms of trance or inebriation, but by this we do not wish to be understood as denying psychic effects from the mushrooms. Here is a matter that calls for serious study under controls.</p>

            <p>Immediately after consuming the 14 pair of mushrooms Aurelio
                takes the <i>amate</i>, rips off a part <i>of a guacamaya</i>
                feather, places it on the paper near the edge, and along with 13
                cacao beans wraps it tightly in the paper, the end of the feather
                extending beyond the paper wrapping. He makes a neat little bundle,
                which he ties up with cotton threads that Clara has been preparing
                for him (Figure E). He puts the parcel by the side of one of the
                turkey eggs.</p>
            
            <figure>
                <img alt="" src="../Images/index-62_1.jpg" />
            </figure>
            
            <p>He repeats this with a second parcel and the second turkey egg. He puts the eggs back where they have been with the two parcels lying between them. Then Aurelio makes four smaller bundles, cutting out small rectangular pieces of <i>amate</i>, wrapping up in each one the piece of feather and five (instead of 13) cacao beans. The six parcels and the eggs are now disposed of as in Fig. F. We assume that the inebriating mushrooms are producing the desired effects while Aurelio busies himself with these duties.</p>

            <figure>
                <img alt="" src="../Images/index-62_3.jpg" />
            </figure>

            <p>Aurelio rolls up his sleeves, takes the <i>pisiete</i> or finely ground green tobacco, rubs it on his forearms, then on his exposed belly, the top of his head, and the back of his neck. He takes matches and places them beside the eggs. He picks up the kernels of maize and casts them with the right hand. He pauses as in thought, breathes deeply and audibly. He rises and then sits down on the stool, wrapping his sarape around him. He sits in thought. He asks where Peter is, and RGW replies that Peter is in Boston. It is now 11.05 o&#8217;clock.</p>

            <p>Aurelio rises and goes to the dark corner near the door, where he sits down on a chair. The last waxen taper is now extinguished and we remain in complete darkness until 1.05 o&#8217;clock in the morning. The storm breaks on Huautla. Aurelio spits on his hands and rubs them together. He asks where we left Peter, in whose house. We tell him. He asks if it is agreeable to us that he should ask these questions, and we say yes. At about this time the shooting and the running by our hut take place.</p>

            <p>Wrapped in his sarape, Aurelio sits on his chair deep in thought. He <a name="divination-5">asks a series of simple questions</a> about Peter, says he has trouble seeing Peter because he is so far away in a city big and strange. Finally he says that Peter is alive but &#8216;they&#8217; are reaching out for him to send him to war. Possibly &#8216;they&#8217; won&#8217;t &#8216;get&#8217; (= <i>agarrar</i>) him, but it is hard to say. Germany seems to enter into the situation.</p>

            <p>Then Aurelio declares that Peter is in New York, not in Boston; that Peter&#8217;s thoughts are on us, that he is in a turmoil, that he is well but in a difficulty that he can hardly cope with, that his thoughts are on us to the point of tears, that he is stumbling, that he is not used to this difficulty where he finds himself, and does not know how to go about writing us about it. Then Aurelio says suddenly that we may smoke, and the room is soon illuminated faintly by two cigars.</p>

            <p>At about this point VPW and Masha, tired and sleepy, express a wish to go home. We have been warned by Victor that no one is ever allowed to leave the ritual before it is done, even to the point that necessities must be performed in the room itself with rude accommodations there provided. But Aurelio says that he can conjure away any dangers. RGW is uncertain whether Aurelio is referring to supernatural dangers, or the dangers on the path to the other house. Apparently to assure their protection, Aurelio holds each of them in turn for a long time by her right forearm, rubs the forearm with <i>pisiete</i>, and takes the pulse <i>with his thumb</i>. (Physicians always take the pulse with the fingers, for in the thumb there is a pulse beat that would confuse the count of the patient&#8217;s pulse.) Demetrio accompanies them through the <i>milpa</i> to the cottage.</p>

            <p>At 1.05 Aurelio lights the four tapers and contemplates the flames. He gives to Don Roberto and RGW a piece of copal each, stirs the embers in the potsherd, asks us to throw our copal on the embers, and under his breath utters a prayer or incantation. He asks us if we believe in one true God, and we so affirm. He holds the four tapers in his two hands, and then asks Demetrio to hold them, declaring then that nothing bad has happened to Peter. He asks how many are present &#8212; &#8220;Only four?&#8221; He asks whether one o&#8217;clock has passed, and when we say yes, he comments, <i>&#8220;Ya es buena hora&#8221;</i> &#8212; now a good hour has come. Then he asks RGW whether he believes in all that is going on here. Inexperienced, RGW begins to reply weakly that he thinks he believes, whereupon the experienced Don Roberto overtakes his words and in a deep, resonant, loud voice declares, <i>&#8220;Creemos&#8221;</i>. Then Aurelio declares in a sure voice that nothing is wrong with Peter and that all goes well. A little later he says that what we are all witnessing is <i>&#8220;muy delicado&#8221;</i> &#8212; most perilous, and that of course we are not used to all this. He says that he can render treatment in absentia on our behalf, after we leave Huautla, and in fact he recommends that we ask him to do this. It is now 1.30 o&#8217;clock.</p>
            
            <p>Aurelio mixes the maize kernels in his two hands, casts half of them and then the other half, and then all the kernels at one time, and then all the kernels a second time. He places one of the hen&#8217;s eggs toward the left side of the cloth and casts the kernels for the fifth time. He places one of the large eggs on the right hand side, and points it in the direction that he says is east. He asks RGW when he will arrive in Mexico City and whether he has a house there. He casts the kernels again, for the sixth time, and then arranges the eggs and bundles in the fashion indicated in Figure G. Then he declares that a relative of RGW is destined to fall seriously ill within the year, and he gravely fixes on RGW his single eye. It is now 1.45 o&#8217;clock.</p>

            <figure>
                <img alt="" src="../Images/index-64_1.jpg" />
            </figure>

            <p>Demetrio replenishes the supply of copal in the potsherd. Aurelio leaves the room a moment, taking some <i>pisiete</i> with him. He returns and again casts the kernels. One kernel happens to stand on end. Aurelio concentrates his attention on it, saying it is RGW&#8217;s son. Then he repeats that a relative of RGW is destined to fall ill within the year.</p>

            <figure>
                <img alt="" src="../Images/index-64_2.jpg" />
            </figure>

            <p>Then he asks RGW whether he can carry bundle no. 1 to his home and keep it for 13 days, along with the corresponding egg. On the 14<sup>th</sup> day RGW may throw them into water or bury them. Aurelio takes one of the turkey eggs and to the blunt end affixes a small lump of copal, which being hot and soft appears to adhere to the egg shell securely. He does the same with each of the hen&#8217;s eggs and finally the other turkey egg. He places the eggs and bundles as shown in Fig. H, but immediately shifts three of the small bundles to the places shown by the arrows. It is now 2.10 o&#8217;clock.</p>

            <figure>
                <img alt="" src="../Images/index-66_1.jpg" />
            </figure>

            <p>In another potsherd Aurelio stands the four tapers upright, and he asks RGW to sit on the chair and roll up his sleeves. Aurelio passes the potsherd with embers over RGW&#8217;s head, along with two of the eggs and two bundles, praying the while, and then he gives the two bundles and eggs to RGW to hold in both his hands. He passes the potsherd under RGW&#8217;s hands, and Demetrio stirs the embers. Aurelio then passes the potsherd with copal over RGW&#8217;s head, then over the ground, then over his head and under his hands, repeating all this several times, relieving RGW of the eggs and bundles but only to hand him another pair of eggs and bundles; asking him then the name of his daughter and repeating the various passes, always making all the passes counter-clockwise. Then Aurelio empties the paper containing the stubs of mushrooms into the fire of the potsherd. He gives this little paper bag to RGW along with a second one, both containing now some <i>pisiete</i>, and he says to RGW that they contain something good from St. Peter and St. Paul. At this stage in the night Aurelio is speaking Spanish or Mazatec, passing from one to the other without apparent reason, and he addresses RGW with the familiar <i>tu</i> instead of the formal <i>Usted</i>. It is now 2.25 o&#8217;clock.</p>

            <figure class="plate">

            </figure>

            <p>Then Aurelio gives RGW certain specific instructions. The turkey egg with copal on the blunt end is for him, and similarly a chicken egg for VPW, each with its respective bundle. These are to be held for 13 days, and then the eggs must be buried with the pointed end down and with the corresponding bundle buried next to each, perpendicularly, the bundle to be carefully placed on the <i>eastern</i> side of the respective egg. In the course of the closing phases of the ritual, Aurelio observes that <i>pisiete</i> is excellent for stomach troubles and that one may eat a little of it. He himself puts something in his mouth, between teeth and cheeks, and presumably this is <i>pisiete.</i></p>


            <p>At 2.30 o&#8217;clock the session draws to a close, and Don Roberto with RGW leave the house to return to their own.</p>

            <p>Before 7 o&#8217;clock on the following morning we were all in the saddle and away. Aurelio and Herlinda had arisen betimes, Herlinda to serve us breakfast and bid us godspeed. We rewarded Aurelio for his night-long vigil with us, giving him 120 pesos or about $15, plus a few pesos for the cost of the accessories that he had used in the ritual &#8212; a princely sum for him which we did not begrudge. These good people waved us on our way, and we shall long remember their friendliness and help.</p>

            <p>On our way out of the Mazatec country we spent the first night in the village of San Bernardino, lodging with the owner of the general store, Dona Toribia Cid de Mendes. This is the village, perched high on the edge of the mountains, that looks far down over the low-lying plain to the west of the Mazatec country. After we had eaten our tortillas and eggs and as we sipped our coffee and mescal, Dona Toribia captured our attention with stories of the Mazatecs. She was herself a Spanish-speaking Mazatec from Mazatlan. Before long she got on the subject of the miraculous mushrooms, and she went on and on until late in the night about the miracles they had worked in those mountains to the east, now sleeping in darkness, until in the end it seemed as though the very hills themselves, where the little mushrooms grow, were bewitched by them.</p>

            <p>There we should prefer to bring our story of Huautla to an end, but candor compels us to add a few more lines. Our attitude toward the <a name="divination-6">divinatory performance</a> and especially the oracular utterances had been one of kindly condescension. We said to ourselves that it was cruel on our part to ask Aurelio, locked up in his unlettered Indian world, to enter understandingly into the problems of the Wassons of New York. His divinatory powers, put to this appalling test, had seemed to us pitifully thin, but of course we had duly entered in our notes all that he had said. In brief, he had declared that Peter was not in Boston but in New York, that Peter was alive but in a deep emotional crisis and longing for our help, and finally that the army was reaching out for him and might yet get him. There was a hint of foreign military service &#8212; Germany was mentioned. Later in the night Aurelio predicted ominously that a member of the Wasson family would be gravely ill within the year.</p>

            <p>We reached home in the second week of September. In the kitchen of our New York apartment we found the leavings of a party that during our absence Peter and his friends had held. The bills from the purveyors supplied the date: the weekend of August 15-16! Peter easily confirmed this when we saw him. Laughingly we credited the sacred mushrooms with a hit, a palpable hit, and then gave the matter no more thought.</p>

            <p>Aurelio&#8217;s prediction about the army had seemed badly aimed. After all, Peter at the age of 17 had enlisted in the National Guard, and this gave him exemption from the draft. Soon after our return to New York, RGW left for Europe on a business trip, and late in the morning of Monday, October 3, he arrived at the Hôtel du Rhône in Geneva. There a cablegram from home awaited him with sensational news: Peter had just made known his settled determination to enlist in the regular army for a three year term. He had come to this decision after a prolonged emotional crisis involving a girl, and that crisis, we now learned, had been boiling while we were in Mexico. Would RGW please send a cablegram at once begging Peter to postpone his rash step? RGW sent the message but, before it reached Peter, he had signed up. The army, after all, had reached out and got hold of him! At the moment of the October crisis our thoughts were so far removed from Huautla that days passed before suddenly Aurelio&#8217;s pronouncement came to mind. Another hit, a palpable one indeed! A few months later, after the usual training period, the army sent Peter abroad for duty, but to Japan not Germany.</p>

            <p>There remained one final prediction: grave illness was to strike the Wasson family within the twelvemonth. (In the Mazatec world the &#8216;family&#8217; embraces all the kin.) This seemed on its face unlikely, for our families are unusually small. No one of the previous generation survives. VPW had only a brother and a sister and some nieces, as well as a few cousins and their children. RGW had only five first cousins and four first cousins once removed. In January one of RGW&#8217;s first cousins, in his 40&#8217;s and abounding in vitality, suddenly died from heart failure.</p>

            <p>We record, as in duty we are bound to do, but without further comment, these strange sequelae to our Huautla visit.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">O</span>n January 14, 1954, Robert Weitlaner wrote us exciting news: his daughter Irmgard Johnson had recently returned from a journey through the Mije country, and in San Juan Mazatlán a <i>curandero</i>, through an interpreter, had told her about two kinds of sacred mushrooms. The Mije are known as a remote people, shut off from the world and in turn disposed to shut out the world. Among them the mushroom cult might manifest archaic traits, and in any case would give us perspective on the Mazatec practices. Would we care to join him on a second pilgrimage in quest of the secrets of the sacred mushrooms? The proposal was too tempting to resist, and through further correspondence the details were worked out for a fast incursion into the Mijeria, as the land of the Mije is called.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn18" id="cp5b14-r18">[18]</a></sup> It proved impossible for VPW and Masha to leave New York, but others were recruited to take their places. Allan B. Richardson, a friend and photographer of New York, eagerly accepted the challenge and prepared himself to serve as official photographer. The Summer Institute of Linguistics consented to let Walter S. Miller join us: a professional linguist, he is the foremost student of the Mije language and culture. For guide, Don Roberto enlisted Francisco Ortega, known as Chico, a thirty-nine year old Zapotec living in Tehuantepec, whose extraordinary talents and character have given him an outstanding reputation among all who explore seriously in the remoter regions of Oaxaca and Chiapas. He in turn engaged a boy named Filemon to help with the animals, three horses and a mule.</p>

            <p>Among those who know about the Indians of Mexico, the Mije enjoy a legendary reputation. It is said of them that in the old days of Zapotec power, centuries ago, the Mije stood off the Zapotecs, and the Spaniards never subdued them in war. They are seldom visited. Even famous writers about the Mexican Indians like Miguel Covarrubias discuss them by hearsay, never undertaking the arduous journey to their mountain villages. Their language for Europeans is of the utmost difficulty, with stress, quantity, and tone, palatalization, glottal stops, retroflexion, and numerous consonants unfamiliar to English or Russian ears. It belongs to a group of which the others are the Popoluca of Vera Cruz, Zoque, and the dying or extinct Tapachultec. Some 60,000 in number, the Mije live in the mountains of northeastern Oaxaca, these mountains rising to their peak in the famed Zempoaltepetl, almost 3,400 meters high. These mountains constitute part of the rugged massif where the Mazatecs live also, but the two peoples are far removed from each other. By comparison the Mazatecs are well advanced toward incorporation in the great world, and the two peoples are separated from each other by no less than three tribes. Next to the Mazatecs on the east live the Cuicatecs, then the Chinantecs, then a swath of Zapotecs, and at last come the Mije. To the east of the Mije he their kin the Zoques in Chiapas and the whole world of the Maya. For us it might prove significant that this people shut off from the world had always been a culture contiguous with the Maya tribes. The reputation of the Mije is that while not aggressive they are uncommunicative with outsiders and even surly. For the most part they live at altitudes below 1,500 meters, and their mountains are clothed in tropical vegetation and abound in wild life. They live on maize and beans, chickens and turkeys, and they sell to the outside world a small amount of good coffee. In all of the Mijería there is not a single road for wheeled vehicles.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn19" id="cp5b14-r19">[19]</a></sup></p>

            <p>On Friday, May 21, RGW flew to Mexico City with Allan Richardson. On the following day, by the gracious generosity of the Banco Nacional de Mexico, the bank&#8217;s De Havilland Dove with Captain Carlos Borja piloting lifted us to the airstrip at Ixtepec in the Isthmus, having stopped at Oaxaca on the way to pick up Walter Miller. At Ixtepec we met Don Roberto and Chico. After laying in some provisions at Ixtepec and Juchitán, we drove by car eastward along the Pan American highway, then north on the Trans-Isthmian highway, and finally westward down an execrable road through Laguna to Santo Domingo Petapa, a stretch of about fifty-five miles. This Zapotec village was our stepping-off point. Next day we set out for San Juan Mazatlán, sometimes called Mazatlán de los Mijes. After a long day we spent the first night sleeping in the school house at Platanillo. Then followed another long day of slow progress up mountains and down, and across arroyos. We slept the second night in the forest, and the following day shortly after noon we entered Mazatlán. From Platanillo to Mazatlán we had met only four Indians and had not seen a single habitation.</p>

            <p>We happened on Mazatlán during the annual fiesta in honor of the Virgen de la Soledad. The village was thronged with Indians bedecked in their finest garbs and there was much music, dancing, and drinking. The thatched houses of the village, perhaps two hundred in number, are strung along the ridges of radiating mountain spurs, the mountain sides themselves being clothed in tropical vegetation and alive with brilliantly colored and highly vocal birds. On all sides the distant horizon is closed in with superb mountains. The altitude of the town is about 3000 feet.</p>

            <p>We made our way to the Municipio, where we found the Presidente, the Secretario, and the Sindico busily engaged in supervising the progress of the fiesta. They received us with reserve, but after we showed our credentials they informed us that we might occupy the <i>curato</i>, the house that would belong to the priest if there were one, a one-room thatched adobe structure adjacent to the thatched church. This suited us admirably, and there we stayed for six days while we pursued our inquiries and took photographs. Allan Richardson with his cameras proved a sensational attraction for the Indians, whose reserve broke down as they besought him for <i>retratos</i> or &#8216;portraits&#8217;, and paved the way for our inquiries. We found that there were eleven <i>curanderos</i> in Mazatlán, four of them women. We talked with four of the men. Don Roberto and RGW called on one of the oldest, Francisco Policarpo, in his home, where we found him reclining in his hammock. He knew no Spanish, and through a feeble interpreter we finally learned that in his practice he had long since given up the use of mushrooms, relying instead on a certain <i>bejuco</i>, a plant of some kind, either a creeper or a climber, perhaps the <i>ololiuqui</i>. We also visited the <i>curandero</i> from whom Irmgard Johnson had learned in January of the use of the divinatory mushroom among the Mije, a discovery for which priority goes to her. She had known him as Francisco Jose, but with us he was Francisco Claudio. He remembered Mrs. Johnson&#8217;s visit well. He spoke almost no Spanish, and his brother Alvaro was to interpret for us, but Alvaro was so sullen that our interview was a failure. We were fortunate, however, when another of the <i>curanderos</i>, <a name="agustin-1">Manuel Agustin</a>, came to us with various ailments for treatment: Walter was skillful with massage and manipulation, and also relieved his pains with analgesics, whereupon the old man answered patiently all our inquiries. The <i>Vocal</i> of the town, Felipe Luciano, a leading citizen, also proved friendly, and persuaded the <i>curandero</i> Timoteo Quirino to discuss mushrooms with us. In addition to these local informants, we were the beneficiaries of a windfall, a delegation from another Mije village of whom we shall speak later.</p>

            <p>The divinatory mushrooms play a rôle among the Mije as important as among the Mazatecs, with many similarities and many important differences. Like the Mazatecs, the Mije always speak of these mushrooms in pairs. For &#8216;pair&#8217; they use in their language a word borrowed from Spanish, <i>casada</i>, which is invariable as to number and which in Mije is used only when &#8216;pair&#8217; means a couple of opposite sexes. Here then is evidence suggesting that in the Middle American mushroom cult, the habitual pairing of the sacred mushrooms carries a sexual connotation. For this there is support also in a folk tale from the town of San Lucas Camotlán, which we shall recount shortly. But we must add that in Mazatec the word for a &#8216;pair&#8217; of mushrooms, <i>nka<sup>2</sup></i>, has apparently no sexual association.</p>

            <p>In Huautla our <i>curandero</i>, as he ate the mushrooms, bit off the caps and all but the butt of the stipes, chewing them thoroughly and then swallowing them. Among the Mije this is done differently. The caps are severed by hand from the stipes; the stipes are firmly attached to the caps and, for their size, tough. The stipes are put back into the <i>jícara</i> or gourd bowl, while the caps are quickly swallowed, without chewing, one after the other. If the mushrooms do not take effect, then the suppliant addresses a prayer to the stipes in their <i>jícara</i>, and eats more caps. Afterwards the <i>jícara</i> with the stipes is carried to a nearby cross and there, reverently, the stipes are spilled out as an offering, and a <i>vela</i> is lighted. All of our informants stressed the separation of the caps from the stems and the separate use of each.</p>

            <p>The mushrooms come only during the rains of June and July, and they can be kept in a dried condition for only fifteen or twenty days. This limits their use to a short season. We arrived unhappily before the rains and we saw no specimens, nor could we see them in use. We were told that in the hot low country the mushrooms do not grow. The atmosphere of secrecy about the mushrooms that was so striking in Huautla is less heavy in Mazatlán, perhaps because this remoter people had never come under such close control by the ecclesiastical authorities. Indeed, there seemed no particular reluctance to discuss the mushrooms. On the other hand, the mushrooms are consumed in private, in the dead of night, if possible under conditions of absolute quiet, usually with only two persons present, the one who eats them and another. As in the Mazatec country, among the Mije we discovered no trace of a communal agape such as the early writers described.</p>

            <p>In Huautla the <i>curandero</i> eats the mushrooms on behalf of his patient or client. Here lies the vital difference with the Mije. For in the Mije country the <i>curan-</i> <i>dero</i> never eats the mushrooms, except as he himself may wish to consult them. The sick person eats them, or the person who seeks tidings of absent relatives or help in finding lost and stolen property. Among the Mije the divinatory mushroom carries no hieratic attributes; it is secular. Everyone knows how to use the mushroom and the <i>curandero</i> is not usually a party to the performance.</p>

            <p>Like the Mazatecs, the Mije possess a general term that embraces all of the divinatory species, but unlike them the Mije consider these species as a subdivision of the order of mushrooms. In Mije the word for &#8216;mushrooms&#8217; is <i>muš</i>, and the collective word for all divinatory mushrooms is <i>na:šwin muš</i>, of which the first word means the World, the Universe. This word enfolds a curious figure of speech: <i>na:š</i> means &#8216;ground&#8217; and <i>win</i> means &#8216;eye&#8217;. (Here and in other words the colon means that the preceding vowel is long in quantity.)</p>

            <p><span id="agustin-2">Manuel Agustín</span>, an old man, disclosed to us a surprising fact: for <i>na:šwin muš</i> there is a synonym, <i>tu:mu&#8217;h</i>. Our friend Felipe was helping Walter as our interpreter with Manuel, and Felipe changed the word to <i>tu:m &#8216;ungk</i>, which another elder of the town, Gerónimo Antonio, later confirmed. They and others knew the word and its meaning, and they all agreed that its inner sense was &#8216;<a name="divine-generation-2">that which is born of itself</a>&#8217;, <i>lo que nace por sí mismo</i>. Here is the same figure that we find in the Mazatec <i>ši<sup>3</sup>to<sup>3</sup></i>! <i>Tu:m</i> of itself means nothing in Mije and occurs elsewhere only in the distinctive Mije calendar of day names, where in the complicated rotation of the native calendar it might turn up in the combination <i>tu:m &#8216;uh</i>. The term seems to be an archaism, with mystical implications that will have to be explored by further study.</p>

            <p>Both Manuel and Timoteo agreed that there are three species of divinatory mushrooms, and their descriptions tallied also:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><i>pi:tpa</i>, &#8216;thread-like&#8217;, the smallest, perhaps two horizontal fingers high, with a cap small for the height, growing almost anywhere, often by the side of the mountain trails. Where one is found more should be sought. The cap is yellowish above and blackish below, and hemispherical.</li>
                <li><i>atka:t</i>, &#8216;alcalde&#8217; or Mayor; like the <i>pi:tpa</i> but bigger, three or four fingers high, with a flatter cap.</li>
                <li><i>kong</i> or <i>kongk</i>, the &#8216;chief or &#8216;head-man&#8217;, which is
                    the biggest, perhaps eight fingers high with a stem ¼ inch in
                    diameter, the color of the&#8217; cap being more yellow than the
                    others.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Our informants agreed that the three kinds differ as to species and not merely in age. They agreed that these mushrooms, eaten raw (either fresh or dried), have an agreeable odor like flowers. The taste is like nothing else. One informant said that in the throat they felt like soda water. As for the dose, every man figures it out according to his tolerance for <i>mescal</i>. Of the <i>pi:tpa</i>, some take six pair, but others take eight, ten, or even twelve; of the <i>atka:t</i>, from three to six pair; of the <i>kong</i>, if two mushrooms are available, one eats around the edge of the two caps; but if only one is available, then one entire cap.</p>

            <p>Anyone may gather the mushrooms. On finding them you may send a sigh of thanks to God, but this is as you please. On the evening when they are to be eaten, toward nightfall, you carry them in a <i>jícara</i> to the church. If the church is locked, you seek out <i>the fiscal</i> or <i>mayordomo</i> and he opens it for you. On the altar you place the <i>jícara</i> with the mushrooms, and burn <i>copal</i> or incense, and either one <i>vela</i> or three. You invoke God&#8217;s blessing and his permission to consult the mushrooms, and you promise him alms, one peso or two or two and a half. Then you bear the mushrooms to the house. A house on the edge of the village is best, where all will be quiet. You place the mushrooms in the <i>jícara</i> on the ground before the household altar, with one <i>vela</i> burning. Someone now goes back to the church with the promised alms.</p>

            <p>The person who is to eat the mushrooms has been on a ceremonially restricted diet for four days. According to Timoteo, for four days you cannot take coffee or liquor, nor eat of any fowl, nor eggs, nor anything fat, nor flesh of pig. But you may eat beef and beans and maize (<i>tortilla</i> and <i>atole</i>), and cheese. During this period you must have no carnal relations. On the morning of the appointed day you may breakfast on the fourth part of a tortilla, a little <i>atole</i>, and a bite of cheese. From then on you fast, eating no lunch or dinner or supper, so that you eat the mushrooms on an empty belly, <i>barriga vacía</i>. Then for the four ensuing days you are on the same diet. A woman with child must never take the mushrooms, for she is sure to go raving mad for good, but they cause no abortion. Our informants were ready with specific instances where this person or that had gone mad for breaking the rules. There was that woman in Platanillo, for example. Being ill, she took the mushrooms, and then, feeling better, she ate chicken forthwith, whereupon <a name="madness-2">she went mad</a>. That was around 1947. She wandered raving through the Mijería for a long time, until finally she disappeared in the mountains. If a woman with child needs to consult the mushrooms she may take them vicariously, a relative or friend eating them for her.</p>

            <p>The reader will observe that the Mije sense no impropriety between the ancient cult of the divinatory mushroom and the cult of the Christian God. In Mazatlán the pagan and the Christian legacies &#8212; the latter a comparatively recent innovation &#8212; seem fully blended, to a degree remarkable even for Latin America. No priest is in residence in Mazatlán and visits by one are rare. The Sunday services, well attended, consist of readings by a cantor, while the <i>curanderos</i>, men and women, at the very altar, under the compassionate countenance of the Virgen de la Soledad, treat the sick and infirm and halt with prayers and ritualistic gestures and the application of eggs to the ailing organs according to pagan rites of great antiquity. To all this we ourselves were witnesses.</p>

            <p>Now we return to the mushroom ceremony. It is night and you hope that all will be quiet. You have eaten the mushroom caps, swallowing them fast, one after the other. The stipes he in <i>thejícara</i> on the ground in front of the household altar, with one <i>vela</i> burning. You and a friend or relative are alone, the second person to watch over you and listen to you, but he says nothing. If the mushrooms work, they work rather fast, in fifteen minutes or a half hour. If they don&#8217;t work, then you make supplication to the stipes, and perhaps light three <i>velas</i> instead of one, and perhaps then they will work. When they work, you begin to talk and you ask questions of the mushrooms and the mushrooms answer. You go on and on with this dialogue until the cock crows, when the talking ends. The person who is with you hears everything but never says anything. It is good to have a relative or friend with you. The whole performance is <i>muy delicado</i>, not to be taken lightly. If someone happens to pass by and perceives what goes on, he withdraws quietly. Afterwards you are faint and weak, and for a time you cannot walk, but you remember all that was said.</p>

            <p>When the mushrooms do not work one should look for either of two explanations. Perhaps there was an interruption. Any undue noise, the wailing of a cat, the braying of an ass, a child bursting in &#8212; these things are enough to put the mushrooms off. Or again if the person eating the mushrooms has spoken ill of them, or even thought disrespectfully of them, there will be no success. If he is guilty of this sin, then the mushrooms cause him to see horrible visions of snakes, <i>tigres</i>, and such like. But when all is well, then he who eats the mushrooms begins by invoking San Juan, the patron saint of Mazatlán, and then says the Pater Noster, the Credo, and the Confiteor,&#8217; and the mushrooms begin to speak, and they are likely to answer not merely the questions put, but all other questions too. Manuel remembers when the prayers were all said in Mije, but now they are said in Spanish, even by people who know no Spanish. All is according to the ordinance of God and the World, says Timoteo. Here again the World &#8212; <i>na:šwin</i> &#8212; appears. With good fortune a virtuous man hears music and may see heaven. As the evening wears on, the mushrooms themselves dictate the program, ordaining such things as the number of <i>velas</i> to be lighted.</p>

            <p>In Mije the cap of the mushroom is called the &#8216;head&#8217; &#8212; <i>kobahk</i> in the dialect of Mazatlán. The top of the cap is the <i>kopk</i> or summit. The stipe is the <i>tek</i> or leg. The edge of the cap is the <i>&#8217;ai</i>, &#8216;leaf. It will be recalled that in the case of the <i>kong</i>, sometimes only this edge is eaten. The lamella or gill is <i>pa:t</i>. Let the reader bear in mind that the cap or pileus is called the &#8216;head&#8217;.</p>

            <p>To the south of Mazatlán, ten hours away by foot, lies the Mije village of Santa María Nativitas Coatlán. One of Walter&#8217;s colleagues, Searle Hoogshagen, is working there, and we had been in Mazatlán only a few hours before he called on us. Moreover, on his bidding two Mije boys of Coatlán came too, Severiano Sánchez, age 33, and Cándido Faustino, age 25. Both of these young men proved first rate as informants, speaking Spanish and understanding the purport of our questions. They described vividly the effect of the mushrooms, how the eater behaves like a drunken man, and how he carries on both sides of a colloquy, posing questions to the mushrooms and then voicing the mushrooms&#8217; answers, for hours on end, in the presence of a relative or friend. They also knew the <i>pi:tpa</i>, the <i>atka:t</i>, and the <i>kong</i>. Of the former the dosage in Coatlán is significant &#8212; for children, 6 pair; for grown-ups, 9 pair, or if this be not enough, 13 pair, or at most 18. The dosage jumps thus from 6 to 9 to 13 to 18. According to native belief, the World or Universe &#8212; <i>na:šwin</i> &#8212; is served by nine Lesser Servants and by thirteen Major Servants. The nine pair and the thirteen pair of mushrooms represent the Lesser and the Major Servants. The word for &#8216;Servant&#8217; is <i>tungmi:tpa</i>. Is it a coincidence that the Mije calendar has eighteen months, and that the Mije week consists of thirteen days, each with its name? A number of other native calendars in Middle America likewise divide the year into eighteen months and the week into thirteen days. Dr. Borhegyi makes a further observation. In the cosmology of the Maya there were nine gods of the Underworld and thirteen gods of Heaven. Are not these the Lesser Servants and the Major Servants of the World of the Mije? If so, we discover here a significant cultural correspondence between the Mije and the Maya.</p>

            <p>Cándido and Severiano told us an extraordinary story of a recent development in the use of the divinatory mushroom in their town of Coatlán. These boys, cousins, have an uncle, Feliciano Faustino. In former times only the <i>curanderos</i> knew the secrets of the mushrooms, but this changed in 1943, when their uncle, Don Fehciano, took in hand a famous <i>curandero</i> of the neighboring town of Santa Margarita Huitepec, by name Pe:t Mu:nt. (Pedro Mundo in Spanish, &#8216;Mundo&#8217; rendering the Mije word <i>na:šwin</i>.) One day at about three in the afternoon Don Fehciano with <i>mescal</i> put Pedro Mundo into a state where he disclosed all the secrets of the mushrooms, and straightway the whole of Coatlán learned the story. From that day on the use of the divinatory mushrooms in Coatlán has become general, everyone invoking the aid of the <i>na:šwin muš</i> when they are available and needed. Both Don Feliciano and Pedro Mundo are still alive and they will tell you about all this. (We do not-question the good faith of our informants when we suggest that their story is a myth-in-the-making to explain the secular possession of holy mysteries.)</p>

            <p>Long before Walter Miller had heard of the mushroom cult or of us, he was living in the Mije town of Camotlán, twenty walking hours to the west of Mazatlán.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn20" id="cp5b14-r20">[20]</a></sup> There he had put down on paper the folk tales that he heard from the mouths of the Mije, and in the course of that work he came upon tales of strange mushrooms, some with a power to heal, and others divinatory, and others of a kind to drive people mad for good. Here is what he heard:</p>

            <p>Of mushrooms there are various kinds. One kind has been used as a medicine, says José Trinidad. His own nephew, Alefonsa, had been ill for five years with an unnamed illness. He could not walk but moved around on a stool. He would sit in the patio and slide the stool from place to place. Then they gave him a kind of mushroom to eat, and he was cured and began to walk as before.</p>

            <p>José says there is another kind of mushroom about which there is a belief that it will induce a dream, a particular kind of dream, one in which two <i>duendes</i> or spirits appear to the eater, one male and the other female. They talk with him, and he asks questions and they answer. They will tell you where lost things may be found, and name the thief who has stolen something and say where the stolen thing is. When you plan a trip, they will tell you what luck you will have on the journey. Cerilo of Santa Margarita Huitepec has eaten these mushrooms several times. The first time they didn&#8217;t give the result. Cerilo has a son named Delfino. When he was about to eat the mushrooms, he was afraid and so he had Delfino watch over him. When he had eaten them, sure enough the spirits appeared. He talked with them and asked about the trip he was going to make, for he had five burros and was about to set out for the Isthmus with Delfino. The spirits told him not to go for the burros would all die. They talked about different things. Then the spirits said, &#8216;We must go, for the cock is crowing.&#8217; The spirits disappeared and Cerilo awoke. Straightway he asked his son if the cock had crowed and was told that it had. But he didn&#8217;t believe the spirits and went on his trip anyway. Just as the spirits had said, all five of his burros died on that trip.</p>

            <p>Another who used these mushrooms was a woman of Camotlán named Rosa. She was of a family from Zacatepec who had moved to Camotlán to live. Later she lived with her own father as his woman. He finally died in Huitepec. So Rosa ate the mushrooms and began to tell the people that the world was coming to an end. And she began to say that she was the mother of the Virgin. She was really deceiving the people very much. Many folk went to her place daily and there they were all day, waning and weeping about their sins. Then some of the younger ones who had been to school talked to the town authorities and got them to threaten to jail her if she didn&#8217;t stop it. The authorities told her they&#8217;d run her out of town if she ate any more of those mushrooms. Why, people were taking offerings to her and getting her to pray for them. That was in 1945. She stopped it then, but some say she <a name="madness-3">seemed to go crazy</a> and wandered around in the woods. She died several years later.</p>

            <p>Here end, for the present, our notes on the rôle of mushrooms in the Mije culture. On Monday, June 1, we set out on our return journey, and Allan Richardson and RGW reached New York on June 5.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">W</span>e have now brought to a close our account of the divinatory mushroom cult in Mexico, insofar as it is known to exist today and is recorded in the annals. Here we would stop, were it not for evidence of an order different from anything so far mentioned, evidence that, if relevant, vastly extends the former range of the Middle American mushroom cult both in time and space. If this enigmatic evidence really relates to mushrooms, as we believe it does, a cult of the sacred mushroom goes back among the highland Maya of Guatemala at least to B.C. 1000, and in that area persisted for close to 2,000 years, until the archeological evidence fades out in what is known as the late classic period, around A.D. 900.</p>

            <p>On September 9, 1952, Dr. Hans Mardersteig of Verona wrote us that he had observed in the new Rietberg Museum of Zurich a curious stone statuette, about one foot high, representing a mushroom with a human face carved in high relief on the stipe. The Museum attributed this artifact to Middle America but seemed to know no more. It had come to the Museum as one of many items in the collection of a private donor. With this letter and this artifact our inquiries into Middle American ethno-mycology began. We reproduce photographs of the remarkable Rietberg mushroom stone.</p>

            <p>By almost the same post Robert Graves sent us a cutting from a pharmaceutical publication<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn21" id="cp5b14-r21">[21]</a></sup> referring to the 16<sup>th</sup> century use of an inebriating mushroom among the Indians of Mexico. This was our first intimation of a mushroom cult in Mexico. At once we embarked on a double-barreled inquiry, pursuing on the one hand the secret of the mushroom stone and on the other hand the cult of the mushroom in Mexico.</p>

            <p>From Dr. Gordon Ekholm of the American Museum of Natural History we quickly learned that the Rietberg artifact was one of many &#8216;mushroom stones&#8217; known to Middle American archeologists, almost all of them discovered in the highlands of Guatemala, most of them in that part of the highlands now inhabited by the Quiché Indians, but a few apparently found to the east across the border in Salvador and to the west in the Ocosingo region of Chiapas, the Mexican state adjoining Guatemala. We quickly made another discovery. In scanning the references to the mushroom stones in specialized publications, we came upon a reproduction of our Zurich artifact in <i>Globus</i>, a learned periodical published in Brunswick, with commentary by the geographer and ethnologist Carl Sapper. The notice appeared in 1898, and it turned out that this Rietberg specimen, unbeknownst to the Rietberg Museum itself, was the earliest mushroom stone to have drawn the attention of the learned world. In its excellent state of preservation and the bold simplicity of its lines, it remains to this day one of the most striking examples of its kind.</p>

            <p>Dr. Sapper described the artifact as mushroom-shaped but he did not suggest that the carving might really represent a mushroom. From Dr. Sapper&#8217;s day to now all archeologists know these artifacts as &#8216;<a name="mushroom-stones-1">mushroom stones</a>&#8217;, but not ,one has ever come to grips with the possibility that they represent what they look like. Indeed it is customary to set off the designation in inverted commas and the learned writers often add a safety clause expressly saying that of course the designation is only one of convenience. Have we not here yet another example of the subconscious rejection of mushrooms by scholars of the mycophobic West? The pattern is too consistent to be accidental. Gitlow shows no curiosity about the mysterious inebriating mushroom in New Guinea. Prescott in his <i>Conquest of Mexico</i>, exercising his editorial discretion, chooses to pass over in silence the inebriating mushrooms of the Nahua. Safford denies their very existence witli^ vehemence suggestive of a violent gastrocolic upset. Beals overlooks the mushrooms in the Mije culture. The archeologists fail to see mushrooms in the &#8216;mushroom stones&#8217;. But, after all, are not these the phenomena that we should expect? The anthropological traits of the anthropologists (which of course they ignore) poise them in a precarious relativity vis-à-vis the cultures that they observe with a god-like superiority, and introduce into their findings a big coefficient of defective perception.</p>

            <p>As we progressed in our inquiries we made a further discovery. None of the archeologists who had contemplated the mushroom stones had ever heard of the mushroom cult of the Indians in Mexico. Conversely, none of the anthropologists of Mexico who knew about the divinatory mushroom had ever paid attention to the mushroom stones of Guatemalan provenience. Apparently we were the first to suggest (be it noted: we do not <i>assert</i>) that the &#8216;mushroom stones&#8217; were actually stone effigies of mushrooms, that there had been at one time a cult of the mushroom in the highlands of Guatemala, and finally that the possibility should be considered of a kinship between such a cult and the surviving divinatory rite of the inebriating mushrooms in Mexico.</p>

            <p>No sooner had we raised the question of the mushroom stones with Dr. Ekholm late in 1952, than he informed us that a brilliant young anthropologist and archeologist of Hungarian origin, Dr. Stephan F. Borhegyi, was at that moment engaged on the first comprehensive and intensive study of all the mushroom stones known to exist. He was in Guatemala City on a Bollingen Foundation grant, engaged primarily in a reorganization of the collections of the Museo Nacional. We communicated at once with him, contributing our mushroomic suggestions, and thus there began a collaboration that for us was most fruitful and exciting. After our visit to Huautla in August 1953, we motored down through the valley of Oaxaca to Tehuautepec and the famous Isthmus. There, on the airstrip at Ixtepec, the private plane of the Banco Nacional de Mexico met us and lifted us to Guatemala City, a few hours away. Thereupon for almost three weeks we devoted ourselves with Dr. and Mrs. Borhegyi to an intensive ethno-mycological inquiry among the Indians of the Guatemalan highlands, to discover whether there was any surviving trace of a mushroom cult.</p>

            <p>Dr. Borhegyi had already brought close to completion his minute examination of all the known mushroom stones, totalling more than a hundred. Additional ones are certain to be discovered as time goes on. They are an extraordinary cultural expression for several reasons. The earliest seem to go back to the period known to Maya students as the early pre-classic or developmental era, in the second millennium B.C. In general the early ones for the layman are the most striking: they are beautifully carved and the figure jutting out from the stipe is often gripping in the vitality of the facial expression. We reproduce one of the best of these, from the collection of Mr. Hans Namuth of New York. This one is late pre-classic, that is, dating from the long stretch of years from B.C. 500 to A.D. 200. The Rietberg specimen appears to be also from the same period. Instead of a human figure, the carved effigy is often of an animal or bird &#8212; a jaguar, <i>pisote</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn22" id="cp5b14-r22">[22]</a></sup>, <a name="deer-2">deer</a>, a stylized bird impossible for us to identify, and-here is for us a surprising discovery &#8212; the toad! We reproduce by line block the best example of a toad mushroom-stone known to us, in profile and full face. The face itself is anthropomorphic, but the four toes are the sure stigma of the amphibian. Dr. Borhegyi considers this specimen pre-classic.</p>

            <p>The mushroom-stones become scarce or perhaps even absent in the early classic period, A.D. 200-500, but around the end of the late classic period, A.D. 600-900, they re-appear, this time crudely carved, often with no effigy on the stipe. Then they vanish for good, and for about the half millennium that preceded the Conquest there is no trace of them, nor do they reappear in human circulation until the end of the ipth century with the publication of Dr. Sapper&#8217;s observations. That the later mushroom stones should be the crudest is hardly surprising: a cult in its pristine vigor expresses itself most freshly.</p>

            <p>Dr. Borhegyi has generously made available to us his chart of the mushroom stones, typing them by chronological and geographical provenience, and we reproduce it here for the first time folded in the pocket at the end of our book.</p>

            <p>The Maya still live in the Yucatán peninsula, Chiapas, Tabasco, and Guatemala. All of the many Indian languages spoken in Guatemala today, both in the low-lying Petén and the Highlands, belong to the Maya family. In the Highlands there are several linguistic families, but three of the languages form a contiguous and kindred nucleus, the Quichoid family &#8212; the Quiché, Kakchiquel, and Tzutujil. Most of the prehistoric mushroom-stones have been found roughly in the area known today as the Quiché and Kakchiquel country. We visited Indian villages of these three peoples, and also Nebaj and San Juan Ixcoy, where Ixil and Kanjobal are spoken, languages related to the important Mam-Maya group. We did not visit the Petén or Yucatán, as no mushroom stones have yet been reported from those regions.</p>

            <p>So far as a living mushroom cult or knowledge of such a thing is concerned, our findings were conclusively negative. The elders in the villages that we visited<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn23" id="cp5b14-r23">[23]</a></sup> were friendly and not reticent. We would bring the conversation around to mushrooms, collect vocabulary, and finally begin to discuss the inebriating virtue of certain kinds. Our informants were invariably surprised to learn that such mushrooms existed, and showed themselves most curious and even envious as we described the divinatory mushrooms of the Mazatecs.</p>

            <p>Though of direct evidence we found none, our inquiries were not fruitless. In the linguistic field we made what may be a pregnant discovery, possibly sensational but in the present state of our knowledge tantalizing. It relates exclusively to the Quiché Indians: the linguistic usage of which we are about to speak and for which we obtained multiple confirmation is unknown in the other places that we visited. Indeed, it seems to be unfamiliar to leading Quiché specialists. In every area that we visited the same word with dialectal variants was used for mushroom: <i>ocox</i>, &#8216;x&#8217; being pronounced like the English &#8216;sh&#8217;. In the Quiché area this word also means the <a name="pudendum-2">external genital organs of the woman</a>. We learned this first in San Pedro Jocopilas and verified it later in other Quiché-speaking communities. Our first informant, Epilonio Girón, after our women folk withdrew on his suggestion, told us of this other meaning of the Quiché word for mushroom, and then added that everyone knew this second sense, but that one should never use it. In short, it is tabu. In Momostenango Suzanne Borhegyi and Masha, off on their own, accompanied by a young Indian woman as interpreter, broached the subject with a flock of Indian women there, whom they discovered washing clothes in the rushing stream. Their inquiries evoked peals of merry laughter, but no elucidation whatever. The women refused to develop the subject, and who shall blame them?</p>

            <p>In our Mazatec inquiries we had uncovered a curious linguistic usage concerning mushrooms. The reader will recall that there is no single Mazatec word that embraces all the mushrooms. There are two, one for all kinds save the divinatory species, and another general term for the various species held in honor as vehicles of divine inspiration. The Indians of Guatemala are not so <a name="mycophagy-5">mycophagic</a> as the Mexicans, but in the market places there mushrooms of various kinds are on sale, and we were startled to discover in Guatemala city that the Spanish word <i>hongo</i> covers all species except one. That one is the favorite for the table and its common name is <i>anacate</i>. In all likelihood <i>anacate</i> is an eroded form of the Nahuatl <i>nanácatl</i>. Whether the borrowing took place before or after the Conquest, we do not know, but already when the Spaniards arrived the Nahuatl influences in the Maya area were powerful. This verbal fission, dividing the mushroom world into two without an overriding collective term, is a curious thing, especially as it recurs in two places as far removed from each other as Huautla and Guatemala City. We took pains to identify the <i>anacate</i> of Guatemala, eating it in quantity and in San Juan Sacatepéquez going out after them in the woods with our interpreter Bravlio. We found them exactly where the market women of Guatemala City had said we should, among the <i>encinos blancos</i>, &#8216;white oaks&#8217;, which turned out to be the oak known to botanists as the quercus fulva. The mushroom could be taken either for a large cantharellus or for a craterellus, and it is in fact the craterellus cantharellus Fr. ex Schw. It is a <a name="chanterelle-3">chanterelle</a> without lamellæ.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn24" id="cp5b14-r24">[24]</a></sup></p>

            <p>Dr. Borhegyi later combed the Quiché and Kakchiquel chronicles and legends for references to mushrooms. There come down to us from early times two native narratives of the Highland Maya, one in Quiché and the other in Kakchiquel, the <i>Popol Vuh</i> and the <i>Annals of the Kakchiquels</i>. Written in the native languages, they have been translated into Spanish and English. Dr. Borhegyi discovered in each of them one reference to mushrooms, and in each case mushrooms are associated with religious observances. These texts were certainly composed after the era we assign to the mushroom stones, but they give us documentary evidence that mushrooms played a rôle in the religious life of the Highland Maya. (We realize that the ancestors of the Quiché and Kakchiquel peoples are supposed to have arrived in their present location as conquerors around the 12<sup>th</sup> century, but whoever the conquerors may have been, it is probable that the indigenous culture absorbed them.) Here is the passage in the <i>Popol Vuh</i>, as presented in the English text by Delia Goetz and Sylvanus Griswold Morley:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>And when they found the young of the birds and the <a name="deer-3">deer</a>, they went at once to place the blood of the deer and of the birds in the mouth of the stones, that were Tohil and Avilix. As soon as the blood had been drunk by the gods, the stones spoke, when the priests and the sacrificers came, when they came to bring their offerings. And they did the same before their symbols, burning <i>pericón</i> and <i>holom ocox.</i></p>
                
                <span class="pullright">[University of Oklahoma Press, 1950, p. 192]</span>
            </blockquote>

            <p>We do not know what <i>pericón</i> was.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn25" id="cp5b14-r25">[25]</a></sup> &#8216;Tohil&#8217; was the Quiché variant of the Toltec Quetzalcoatl, the &#8216;feathered serpent&#8217;, but we know not how the god Avilix looked. <i>Holom ocox</i> means &#8216;mushroom head&#8217;. In San Martín Jilotepeque our informant Alberto Calán had told us of an unwholesome mushroom known to him as the <i>holom ixpek</i>, &#8216;toad&#8217;s head&#8217;, a name doubly interesting for us because it links the mushroom with the toad and because of the fungal use of the word for &#8216;head&#8217;, reminding us of the passage in <i>Popol Vuh</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn26" id="cp5b14-r26">[26]</a></sup></p>

            <p>The passage in the <i>Annals of the Kakchiquels</i> as translated from the original by Adrián Recinos and into English by Delia Goetz reads thus:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>At that time, too, they began to worship the devil. Each seven days, each thirteen days, they offered him sacrifices, placing before him fresh resin [i.e., <i>copal</i>], green branches, and fresh bark of the trees [i.e., <i>amate?</i>], and burning before him a small cat, image of the night. They took to him also the mushrooms of the trees, and drew blood from their ears.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Again the words in the original tongue are <i>holom ocox</i>, &#8216;mushroom heads&#8217;, and they are described as &#8216;of the trees&#8217;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn27" id="cp5b14-r27">[27]</a></sup> We had learned in Huautla that one of the four kinds of sacred inebriating mushrooms grows hi trees, and Juan de Cordoba in his Zapotec lexicon calls it the <i>nocuana peneeche</i>. Here then hi the Kakchiquel text, which was put down on paper after the Conquest under Spanish influences but which recalls pre-Conquest events, we read of a religious rite in which arboreal mushrooms were used.</p>

            <p>Both the Quiché and the Kakchiquel narratives use the same expression &#8212; <i>holom ocox</i>. Obviously this should be translated as &#8216;mushroom caps&#8217;, and we know from our Mije notes that the cap in Mije is a &#8216;head&#8217;. We find the same metaphor in Mazatec, where the cap of the mushroom is the <i>hko<sup>4</sup></i>, meaning &#8216;head&#8217;. Perhaps the reader has hit on the further observation that we now make. The Mije and Mazatecs in their mushroom cult lay stress on the separation of pileus from stipe, and the virtue lies primarily in the pileus. They are still following the practice recorded for us by the ancient Quiché and Kakchiquel narrators, still decapitating their ceremonial mushroom.</p>

            <p>As we thumb through the pages of Sahagún&#8217;s immense work, in the Florentine Codex, we discover yet another miniature relevant to our argument. Executed by an Indian under Spanish influence, it is pregnant with mushroomic meaning. On the left we discover an Indian drinking from a Spanish goblet. On the right are two mushroom caps, &#8216;heads&#8217;, the Quiché <i>holom ocox</i>, the Mije <i>kobahk</i>, the Mazatec <i>hko<sup>4</sup></i>. There are a pair of these caps, i.e., the Mije <i>casada</i>. A decapitated stipe stands on one side. Thus in this picture we come upon themes familiar to us from present-day usages among the Mije and Mazatecs and in the pre-Conquest annals of the Quiché and Kakchiquel peoples. We have found in Sahagún&#8217;s text no passage that this miniature illustrates. What does it mean? We venture a rash but tempting guess. There must have been a moment in the social history of 16<sup>th</sup> century Mexico when the fire-water of the Spaniards confronted the inebriating mushrooms of traditional use with a challenge deeply disturbing to the emotions of the conservative Indians. Does not this miniature illustrate that moment of challenge? The mushroom caps are disproportionately big: this is the artist&#8217;s device for showing their subjective importance, just as in the earlier miniature, on page 235, Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Underworld, hovers with giant stature over the Indian who is eating his pair of <i>teo-nanácatl</i>.</p>

            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">I</span>n the indigenous cultures of Middle America one of the crucial problems for anthropologists is the interplay, over thousands of years, between hieratic cultures on the one hand, rising and falling spasmodically and sporadically and often leaving behind spectacular monuments, and on the other hand, the folk cultures of the farming population, simple, relatively homogeneous, and singularly tough in resisting outside influences.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn28" id="cp5b14-r28">[28]</a></sup> Humble artifacts such as incense burners, figurines, and clay effigies fashioned so as to serve also as whistles have been made in virtually the same styles for three thousand years and are still being sold at the present hour in the native market places. The mushroom stones do not belong to this folk culture. If they are a clue to a mushroom cult, we must suppose that the cult was hieratic, the attribute of a priestly élite, and that that cult passed away with that élite. The highest achievements of the Mayan culture, which are known to have been hieratic, belonged to the lowland Maya of the Petén and Yucatán, where no mushroom stones have been found.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn29" id="cp5b14-r29">[29]</a></sup> However, there could also have been priest-governed societies in the Highlands, and in fact in the Highland excavations at Kaminaljuyu, near Guatemala City, there has been found in a pre-Classic tomb that was probably sacerdotal one of the effigy mushroom stones, representing a jaguar<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn30" id="cp5b14-r30">[30]</a></sup>. We suggest that there was once a mushroom cult in the Highlands in the formal, organized saense, a liturgy administered by priests on set occasions, perhaps for the laity to join in. How different such a cult would be from the intimate, family use of the divinatory mushrooms that we have witnessed among the Mazatecs and Mije, where the mushrooms are consulted, when available, if needed, in the dead of night, with only two or three gathered together! But there is no necessary contradiction here. Our 16<sup>th</sup> century writers tell us of the large gatherings where the mushrooms were consumed in public. And what could have been more inviting to a priestly élite than to take over from the folk culture their divinatory mushrooms, and clothe the deeply stirring faith of the people in those divine mushrooms with the ceremonial habiliments that an elaborate ritual would have required? As we review our evidence, we discern an endemic use of inebriating mushrooms from earliest times in the enduring folk culture of Middle America, not in the low, hot country, but throughout the higher country, over an area extending from the Valley of Mexico into Guatemala and Salvador. We see this endemic folk usage seized upon, taken over, lifted up, and reverently exploited by the sophisticated priestly élite in certain hieratic phases of the upland cultures.</p>
            
            <p>Certainly we have not discovered the tie that would unequivocally bind the mushroom stones of Guatemala and Chiapas with today&#8217;s intimate folk cult. That such a link will be discovered is unlikely but not impossible. Perhaps on some holy hill or <i>cerro</i>, or deep in the recesses of some cave, in a remote corner of Oaxaca or Chiapas, the Indians still direct their humble supplications to a stone image of a mushroom, unbeknownst to circumambulating ethnologists. Unless someone discovers such a survival, how can we hope to establish a connection between the ancient stone carvings and the divinatory mushrooms.</p>

            <p>Yet the evidence that we have assembled points toward such a connection. We know that the Indians of Middle America are mycophiles with extensive knowledge of mushroomic properties and corresponding vocabularies. In their cultures mushrooms have always been emphasized, not ignored. Among these Indians religious associations have always interpenetrated every aspect of human existence, and it would be rash to assume that this fusion of daily life with religious beliefs excluded the fungal world at the time when the mushroom stones were carved. We know furthermore what a profound hold the ceremonial mushrooms have to this day on certain of the remoter Indian tribes, and the range of this cult doubtless runs beyond the limits that we have had opportunity to explore. In the case of the Mije, their country overlaps the area where the later mushroom stones seem to have been found. We know from surviving annals that before the Conquest ceremonial mushrooms were used in religious observances in the Guatemalan Highlands, where most of the earlier stones have been found. A divinatory mushroom grips the imagination, and it would justify the functional use, in religious ceremonies, of the mushroom stones. The presence of a divinatory mushroom is rare in human cultures: would it not be extraordinary to find a mushroom cult in the same area with the mushroom carvings &#8212; themselves unique &#8212; and yet unrelated to them? Whereas in the past no one was suggesting a mushroomic explanation for the mushroom stones, we think that the presumption favors such an explanation now, and that the burden of the argument must he on those who oppose it.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile many exciting questions remain unanswered and cry for the further field work that we cannot undertake. We have not fully identified the divinatory mushrooms that the Mazatecs and Mije use, to say nothing of other peoples where the cult may survive. They must be securely identified, with multiple corroboration. Their specific properties as understood by the Indians must be fully set down. Then they must be proved empirically, under controlled conditions. The Mije have developed sweeping explanations for any failures in the use of their divinatory mushrooms: this suggests that auto-suggestion plays a rôle, or that sometimes the wrong mushroom is taken, or that the virtue varies under differing circumstances. The difficult task of chemical analysis, with the isolation of the active agents, will be the final achievement.</p>

            <p>The Mije are related linguistically to the Zoques, their neighbors to the east in Chiapas. What do the Zoques know of the divinatory mushrooms? If they use them, perhaps we shall discover, after all, that the Maya peoples immediately to the east of them also share the cult, or remember having practiced it in the past.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b14-fn31" id="cp5b14-r31">[31]</a></sup> Robert Weitlaner knows the Chinantecs as well as any other living anthropologist. Among them he has failed to find any trace of the divinatory mushroom, though they live between the Mazatecs and the Mije. How strange this is! But it only points up the importance for all workers among the Indians of Middle America, both linguists and anthropologists, to include the divinatory mushrooms in their inquiries, and to report their findings whether negative or positive. Where the cult does not survive, memories of it may, and where no memories exist, perhaps in the names for mushrooms the linguists may trace forgotten knowledge. Slowly we should begin to pinpoint the results of such inquiries on a cultural map of Mexico keyed to the mycological lore of the Indians. But the search for evidence should not be limited to our contemporary world. The whole corpus of surviving pre-Conquest artistic expression in the highland areas of Middle America should also be reviewed, on the chance that divine mushrooms figuring therein have hitherto escaped detection. Later we shall venture some suggestions of our own in this archeological field.</p>

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b14-fn10">The Johnson paper is important. Entitled &#8216;The Elements of Mazatec Witchcraft&#8217;, it was published by the Gothenburg Ethnographical Museum in Sweden in 1939 as Ethnological Studies 9. Dr. Schultes published two papers, one as a Botanical Museum Leaflet, Harvard University, Feb. 21, 1939, vol. 7, no. 3, <i>The Identification of Teonanacatl</i>; the other, &#8216;Teonanacatl: the Narcotic Mushroom of the Aztecs&#8217;, in the <i>American Anthropologist</i>, n.s., 42, 1940. These three and Dr. Reko&#8217;s <i>Mitobotánica Zapoteca</i>, published by himself in 1945, constitute our basic modern bibliography. Victor A. Reko&#8217;s <i>Magische Gifte</i>, of which a third edition appeared in Stuttgart in 1949, must be read with caution. For example, he guesses at the identity of the inebriating mushroom, postulating an &#8216;amanita muscaria var. mex.&#8217; More disturbing is his assertion that <i>poyomatli</i>, a narcotic plant, was a mushroom. He arrives at this conclusion by misquoting a passage in Sahagún (substituting <i>llamados</i> for <i>llamada</i>), and by ignoring another passage in Sahagún where the <i>poyomatli</i> is described in detail as a plant. (See <i>Magische Gifte</i>, 1949, p. 126; Sahagún, Book X, Chap. 24, <i>Cañuto de Humo;</i> also Book XI, Chap. 7, Sec. 7.) Since Victor Reko published his work in German, German writers frequently cite him and are misled by him. The modern discussions of our subject are also bedeviled by two idle conjectures of the late Marshall H. Saville, the archeologist, who without a shred of supporting evidence suggested (1) that the Aztec ruler Tizoc had been murdered with poisonous mushrooms, and (2) that the astonishing dental work found in the teeth of Zapotec skeletons had been performed with the aid of mushrooms as narcotics. For the Tizoc reference, see J. Eric Thompson&#8217;s <i>Mexico before Cortez</i>, Scribner&#8217;s, New York, 1933, p. 31. As for the Zapotec dental work, Saville tossed out his fanciful notion in an extempore, unrecorded talk before the Explorers&#8217; Club, New York (<i>Explorers Journal</i>, 1934, vol. 12, p. 7) and a subsequent interview (<i>The New York Times</i>, April II, 1934). The Swedish archeologist S. Linné took Saville&#8217;s dental suggestion seriously; see <i>Ethnos</i>, Stockholm, Jan. - June 1940, p. 7. Schultes in his two papers quotes Saville (via Thompson) on Tizoc. Safford&#8217;s mushroomic nihilism may have led, by reaction, to Saville&#8217;s postulating mushroomic agents right and left in pre-Conquest Middle America. As Saville never offered his mushroomic ideas formally, we infer that he regarded them as speculative. Blas Pablo Reko in his <i>Mitobotánica Zapoteca</i> (pp. 13, 14, 44, 53, and 95) reported names for inebriating mushrooms in contemporary Zapotec, but he failed to place his informants. In a typewritten note of his left with Mr. Weitlaner he states that in 193 5 he found the divinatory mushrooms in use among the Zapotecs of Santiago Yaveo and the Chinantecs of Teocalcingo, two villages situated hard by the Mije country. He gives Chinantec names for these mushrooms (<i><a name="a-ni">a-ñi</a></i> and <i><a name="a-mo-kia">a-mo-kiá</a></i>). The Chinantecs generally do not know the mushrooms, and if Dr. Reko&#8217;s report is reliable, we suspect a cultural borrowing from the neighboring Mijes. Our own efforts to discover knowledge of the divinatory mushrooms among the Zapotecs of Tehuantepec and the Valley of Oaxaca have been unsuccessful. Pedro Carrasco reports the present day use of the divinatory mushroom in Zapotec country, among the Zapotecs of the southern coast, in the western part of the district of Pochutla, in the village of San Bartolo Loxicha, where he says it is called the <i>santo nanacate</i>. See his &#8216;Una Cuenta Ritual entre los Zapotecos del Sur&#8217; in the Festschrift entitled <i>Homenaje al Doctor Alfonso Caso</i>, Mexico, 1951, p. 93.

Just to the east of Camotlán, in the <i>llano</i>, there is a hill <i>(kopk)</i> that the people call <i>mužut kopk</i>. No one recalls the origin of the first part of this name, but it could be <i>muš hut</i>, &#8216;mushroom cave&#8217;. In this hill there is a cave that the villagers call <i>mužut hut</i>. The supposition suggests itself that the hill was called after the &#8216;mushroom cave&#8217;, and long afterwards, when the origin of the name had been forgotten, the cave in turn was called after the hill. Deep in the cave the floor is strewn with fragments of ancient pottery and other artifacts, but there are no representations of mushrooms. A local informant has told Mr. Miller that on the top of the hill can be seen a stone shaped to resemble a gigantic spindle whorl, <i>malacate.</i>&#160;<a href="#cp5b14-r20">&#8617;</a></li>

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b14-fn22">This is the native name of the coatimundi (nasua narica), of the same family as the raccoon, a family distinguished anatomically by the fact that the males possess a phallic bone. The <i>pisote</i> was associated with phallic matters by the Maya, but no phallus is present in any mushroom stone so far discovered. In Mexico the <i>pisote</i> is called the <i>tejón.</i>&#160;<a href="#cp5b14-r22">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b14-fn23">For workers in the field we supply the names of our informants and their towns. Kakchiquel-speaking: San Juan Sacatepequez, the official interpreter Bravlio; San Martin Jilotepeque (the language here influenced by ancient Pokomam occupation), Don Francisco Martínez del Rosal, owner of finca Las Pilas, and Alberto Calan, 3rd regidor; Sololá, <span id="akichi">Nicolás Akichi</span>, textile vendor. Quiché-speaking: Chichicastenango, Miguel Ignacio, the maker of wooden dance masks, and Diego Panjojehán, who lives in Chujupén; San Pedro Jocopilas, Epilonio Girón, head of the municipal guard, and Don Ignacio Barrios, Mayor; San Andrés Xecul, Pedro Raimundo Hernández; Momostenango, Aparecio and Santiago Lajpop. Tzutujil-speaking: Santiago de Atitlan, the cripple Don Salvador Ramirez and the artist Juan Sisay. The following are sub-divisions of the Mam group. Ixil-speaking: Nebaj, Trinidad Gómez, candle-maker. Jacalteca-speaking: Concepción Huista, Antonio Ramírez Paz, former alcalde. Kanjobal-speaking: San Juan Ixcoy, Mateo Velazquez, alcalde, and F.

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b14-fn24">Our specimens of the <i>anacates</i> were the subject of a note by Professor Roger Heim that appeared in the <i>Revue de Mycologie</i>, April 1954, Tome xix, Fasc. i, pp. 53fF.&#160;<a href="#cp5b14-r24">&#8617;</a></li>

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b14-fn26">The Quiché word for &#8216;toad&#8217;, <i>ixpek</i>, is startling because of its superficial resemblance to the Indo-European  root discussed on pp. 92 ff. We found several variants &#8212; <i>xepek, ixpŭk, xpŭk</i> &#8212; in the towns we visited. In all cases &#8216;x&#8217; has the phonetic value of English &#8216;sh&#8217;. The word carries other meanings, such as &#8216;cave&#8217; in Quetzal-tenango. In Chichicastenango we found that a similar word relates either to the vagina or the womb. We are told that in the Zapotec dialect spoken at Mitla <i>xkep</i> means &#8216;womb&#8217;. We had neither time nor competence to explore the suggestion here of a cultural association linking toads to fertility such as we find in Europe. &#160;<a href="#cp5b14-r26">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b14-fn27">In the Recinos-Goetz translation, University of Oklahoma Press, 1953, pp. 82-83, the passage is rendered thus: &#8230; the mushrooms (which grow at the foot) of the trees &#8230; The interpolated words are obviously superfluous, the translators presumably not knowing that many mushrooms grow in trees. This reference to tree fungi reminds us of a curious passage in the <i>Relación de las Minas de Temazcaltepec</i>, where Caspar de Covarrubias enumerates briefly the kinds of food that the people eat, and in the brief list he finds place to include <i>ongos de arboles</i>, &#8216;tree-mushrooms&#8217;. See <i>Papeles de Nueva España</i>, Paso y Troncoso, Madrid, 1905, vol. vn, p. 31. Juan de Córdoba&#8217;s 16<sup>th</sup> century Zapotec lexicon refers to arboreal fungi, and in Huautla our <i>curandero</i>, Aurelio Carreras, spoke of a divinatory species growing on wood. It seems probable that arboreal fungi play a distinct rôle in Middle-American fungal lore, one that remains to be explored.&#160;<a href="#cp5b14-r27">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b14-fn28">For an illuminating discussion of this problem see Stephan F.

C., vol. v, No. 26, April 1954.&#160;<a href="#cp5b14-r28">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b14-fn29">Is it coincidence that, just as the mushroom stones are found only at a certain altitude and never in the hot, low country, so according to our informants in Huautla and Mazatlán, the use of the divinatory mushroom is unknown among the Mazatecs and Mije living today in the <i>ticrra caliente?</i>&#160;<a href="#cp5b14-r29">&#8617;</a></li>

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b14-fn31">There are grounds for linking together the Maya and the Mije-Zoque cultures, the two linguistic groups being perhaps descended from a common parent stock.
