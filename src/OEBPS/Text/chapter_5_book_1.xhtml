        <section class="main">
            <p>The sinister mark of the toad is not confined to the English fungal vocabulary. You will find it in Norwegian and Danish, though not in Swedish; in Low German, Dutch, and Frisian; in Breton, Welsh, and Irish. The romance languages know it not, except for traces in French. Nor does it survive in standard High German, though it lingers on in High German dialects. Thus the citadel of the &#8216;toadstool&#8217; is in the ring of peoples who dwell around the shores of the North Sea, a gigantic and evil Fairy Ring, as it were, embracing fringes of the Teutonic peoples and the surviving Celts, along with the French. (The Bretons, let it be remembered, emigrated from Britain to their present home across the Channel in the fifth and sixth centuries after Christ, and are thus remote heirs, folkwise, of old Britain.)</p>

            <p>Not all of these peoples use the figure of the
            toad&#8217;s stool. The Norwegians and Danes speak of the
            toad&#8217;s hat; the Low Germans, of the frog&#8217;s
            stool; the Dutch say toad&#8217;s stool; and the Frisians
            refer to an old fungus as a toad&#8217;s hide. The Irish
            term is the frog&#8217;s pouch; the Welsh, toad&#8217;s
            cheese; the Bretons, toad&#8217;s cap, but by the addition
            of a single initial sibilant, their term becomes
            toad&#8217;s stool, and this is a recognized variant in
            their language. Here are the words in these tongues: in
            Norwegian and Danish, paddehat; in Low German,
            poggenstohl; in Dutch, paddestoel; in Frisian, poddehud;
            in Irish, bolg losgainn, with bolg meaning pouch; in
            Welsh, caws llyffant, with caws meaning cheese; in Breton,
            kabell tousec, and also skabell tousec. The Pennsylvania
            Dutch speak a dialect of High German that comes down from
            the language of the Palatinate in the i8th century, and in
            Pennsylvania Dutch we find both toad&#8217;s stool and
            toad&#8217;s foot: grottestuhl and grottefuss. We know
            that toad&#8217;s bread, pain de crapault, was used for
            wild fungi in i6th century France, and this same
            expression has been reported in modern times in the
            Calvados region of Normandy. The amanita muscaria, with
            its red cap flecked by warts, is called crapaudin in some
            parts of France and this word in the form grapaoudin has
            been reported as far south as the Herault, on the
            Mediterranean. <sup><a epub:type="noteref"
            href="#cp5b1-fn1" id="cp5b1-r1">[1]</a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>All these words, in varying degrees, exhale a bad odor.
                They designate wild fungi that the speaker considers,
                rightly or wrongly, inedible and dangerous. The English
                toadstool, freighted with evil, is typical of the class.
                In the dialects of England there are numerous variants,
                and these are interesting because they echo the figures of
                speech that are current in our list of foreign words. Thus
                we find toadcheese or taddecheese, toad&#8217;s bread, toad&#8217;s
                cap or toadskep, and toad&#8217;s meat. For the toad itself
                there is an ancient variant, pad or paddock, which gives
                us paddock-stool and puddock-stool. This &#8216;pad&#8217; is the same
                word for toad that the Dutch and Frisians, the Norwegians
                and Danes, use. This is the witches&#8217; word in the opening
                scene of Macbeth:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Padock calls anon: faire is foule, and foule is faire,<br/>
                    Hover through the fogge and filthie ayre.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Here in our argument we interrupt its course for a necessary diversion. Today civilized men have a kindly feeling for the toad. Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Grahame have planted the seeds of their benign influence in the minds of successive generations of well brought up English-speaking children. The Victorians were inclined to foster sympathy for the whole animal world. (Was this because the industrial revolution released increasing numbers of men from slavery to the soil, from intimate conflict with cantankerous nature?) As for the toad, there has been an additional influence: men of science have undertaken to show that it is the farmer&#8217;s friend.</p>

            <p>Far different was the repute of the toad in times past. There was no other member of the animal kingdom that inspired such revulsion and fear. Chaucer spoke of the &#8216;foule tode&#8217;, and Spenser of the loathly and venomous toad. &#8216;A pad in the straw&#8217; was what our ancestors said when they meant &#8216;a nigger in the woodpile&#8217;. (Now that this last phrase is banned in polite society and perhaps vanishing, why not revive the earlier expression?) Shakespere reveled in the toad as a potent term of abuse. In Richard III the toad is a recurring theme, as is fitting for a play about a king described as:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>That bottel&#8217;d Spider, that foule bunch-back&#8217;d Toad.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Among all of Shakespere&#8217;s many references to the toad, there is not one that is
                neutral, much less friendly. Edgar in King Lear denounces Edmund as &#8216;a most
                toad-spotted traitor&#8217;; and the witches in Macbeth, when they concoct their
                hellish brew, give to the toad pride of place in the
                cauldron:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>Toad, that under cold stone Days<br/>
                    and nights hast thirty-one<br/>
                    Swelter&#8217;d venom sleeping got, Boil<br/>
                    thou first i&#8217; the charmed pot.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Not only were toads venomous: to the medieval mind they were also a symbol of lechery, as were warts and moles, with which toads were supposed to be covered. We shall return to this matter of lechery; for the present we only direct the reader&#8217;s attention to the visual use of the toad in this sense by Hieronymus Bosch, in his <i>Seven Deadly Sins,</i> of which we reproduce the pertinent detail in Plate xm.</p>

            <p>The evil repute of the toad is not yet dead. There are English circles where &#8216;Toad!&#8217; flung in anger would be a fighting insult now. The derivative &#8216;toady&#8217; brings to mind the sycophantic and hypocritical squat of the creature, with its upturned watchful eyes. The bad name of the toad survives among un-tutored countryfolk in England and the United States, where farmers cling to the belief that the spittle of toads is poisonous, and that warts will grow on the skin where a toad has touched. French peasants down to recent times, and perhaps even now, put toads to death by methods shocking for their cruelty, methods that reveal an ingenuity in torture ordinarily reserved by man for his fellow-men.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b1-fn2" id="cp5b1-r2">[2]</a></sup> The venom-spitting toad in all his horrible lineaments was painted for us by Hieronymus Bosch in a detail of his <i>Judgment Day.</i> Summoned from his grave, a nude Cardinal (his worldly office proclaimed by his hat) is floating away to everlasting damnation as a squatting toad directs a shaft of his deadly saliva at the passing corpse.</p>

            <p>Toads were closely linked with witchcraft. In France
            all witches harbored toads as their familiars, and this
            was common in England and Scotland too. In 1591, trials
            held in North Berwick elicited from the members of certain
            witches&#8217; covens clear testimony that they had tried
            to murder King James VI of Scotland, and that one of their
            plans had been to drop toad&#8217;s venom on his head or
            body, and to smear his small clothes with it.<sup><a
            epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b1-fn3"
            id="cp5b1-r3">[3]</a></sup> Presumably the poison was to
            invade the person of the king through abrasions of the
            skin, which in those days of absent hygiene and parasitic
            insects were taken for granted. From the contemporary
            records of this case we learn that &#8216;to drop a
            toad&#8217; was the idiom used at that time for the
            milking of a toad&#8217;s venom &#8212;&#8203; a meaning of the verb &#8216;to drop&#8217; that the Oxford Dictionary fails to record&#8212;&#8203;and in one of the accounts of the trial we even learn the details of the method used. Here is a paraphrase of the testimony of Agnis Tompson, a defendant, as published in <i>Newes from Scotland Declaring the Damnable Lif and death of Dr. Fian,</i> printed in London for William Wright in 1591:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>She confessed that she took a blacke Toade, and did hang the same up by the heeles, three dales, and collected and gathered the venome as it dropped and fell from it in an Oister shell, and kept the same venome close couered, untill she should obtaine any parte or peece of foule [soiled] linnen cloth, that had appertained to the Kings Maiestie, as shirt, handkercher, napkin or any other thing which she practised to obtaine by meanes of one John Kers, who being attendant in his Maiesties Chamber, desired him for olde acquaintance betweene them, to helpe her to one or a peece of such a cloth as is aforesaide, which thing the said John Kers denyed to helpe her too, saying he could not help her too it.</p>

                <p>And the said Agnis Tompson by her depositions since her apprehension saith, that if she had obtained any one peece of linnen cloth which the King had worne and fouled, she had bewitched him to death, and put him to such extraordinary paines, as if he had beene lying upon sharp thornes and endes of Needles.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>It comes as a shock to modern man to learn that his ancestors considered the common toad venomous as the adder. It comes as a double shock to him when he learns that these ancestors were probably right, and that on this subject they were better informed than he is. The toad has no fangs and cannot bite. But on his coarse skin are scattered numerous glands that look like warts or pustules; and when the creature is frightened or in pain, these glands exude a milky fluid, which is powerfully toxic. Hidden inside the skin, invisible to the naked eye, is another set of glands, which lubricate the skin with a slimy mucoid secretion, easily perceived by the human hand but perhaps not poisonous. The witches who kept toads as their familiars knew the wicked properties of the toad&#8217;s milky secretion, and it is a fair surmise that the singular tortures reserved for toads by some countryfolk were originally devised to milk the toads of their deadly drops. The venom of the toad cannot penetrate healthy human skin, but takes hold of any mucous membrane, and if swallowed or absorbed through an abrasion of the skin, might well be lethal. Among those who work with toads, it is common knowledge that their secretions, if accidentally brought into contact with the eyelid, cause an acute burning irritation. (The inflamed swelling of the sebaceous gland at the margin of the eyelid, commonly known in English as a stye, is called in vulgar Dutch <i>paddescheet,</i> &#8216;toad&#8217;s excrement&#8217;, even when no toad is involved.)</p>

            <p>In the 15<sup>th</sup> century Chronicle of St. Albans there is an account of the death of King John of England that possesses extraordinary interest both for its own sake and for the role played in it by a toad. History relates that the King in the year 1216 was making his way north with his retinue, dogged by his enemies and ill. In crossing the Wash he lost much of his baggage train, to his great sorrow, and after lying at the Cistercian monastery at Swineshead, he progressed some distance beyond to the castle at Newark-on-Trent, where he died on October 19, on &#8220;the morrow after St. Luke&#8217;s Day&#8221;. The Chronicle of St. Albans says that his death was precipitated by a draught of poisoned ale served to him at Swineshead. Though perhaps the scribe was only giving currency to a malicious canard, this scarcely affects the interest of his narrative for us, because he was writing what he and his contemporary readers were ready to accept, and the role in the affair that he assigns to a toad conformed to common beliefs and probably to esoteric knowledge. The provocation that the scribe reports for the alleged regicide is curious. The King swore a great oath, says the chronicler, that if he was spared another six months, the loaf of bread then worth a ha&#8217;penny would be selling at 20 shillings! A modern reader may be excused if this passage conjures up for him the specter of runaway inflation, but for the chronicler and his public it meant famine and panic in the market place. Why should King John have foreseen famine and panic as the inevitable sequel to his own survival? And why should the chronicler, as well as the monk of Swineshead, have considered this sequence so obvious that it called for no explanation? Miss Margaret Murray in <i>The Divine King in England</i> uncovers the strange beliefs that seem to have underlain the King&#8217;s great oath and justified the monk&#8217;s deed in his own eyes and his superior&#8217;s, a vignette of medieval behavior baffling for us but clear and simple then.</p>

            <p>Here, then, is the story of King John&#8217;s death as put down about the year 1483, more than 250 years after the event, by the chronicler of St. Albans:<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b1-fn4" id="cp5b1-r4">[4]</a></sup></p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The Kyng came by the Abbey of Swynesheade, and there hee abode two dayes; And as he sate at mete, he axed a Monke of the house, How moche that loof was worth that was sette before hym uppon the table &gt; And the Monke said, That the loof was worth but an half-penny. O said the Kinge tho [then], Here is grete chepe of brede; Now sayd he tho, And [=if] I may lyve ony while, such a loof will be worth xx. shillinges or half a year be gone. And so whan hee sayd this worde, moche hee thought, and often hee sighed, and toke and etc of the brede, and sayd; By God, the worde that I have spoken, it shall be soth. The Monke that stode before the Kynge was for this worde full sory in his herte, and thought rather hee would hymselfe suffre deth, and thought yf he might ordeyne therefore some manere remedye. And anone the Monke wente unto his Abbot and was shriven of him, and tolde the Abbot all that the Kynge had sayd; And prayed his Abbot for to assoyle [absolve] him, for he would yeve the Kynge such a drynke, that all Englonde sholde be glad thereof and joyfull. The[n] yede [went] the Monke into a gardeyne, and founde a grete Tode therein, and toke her up and put her in a Cuppe, and prycked the Tode thorugh with a broche many tymes, tyll that the venym came out of every syde in the Cuppe, And tho toke the Cuppe and filled it with good ale, and brought it before the Kynge, knelynge sayenge; Sir, sayd hee, Wassayll, for never the dayes of all your lyfe dronke ye of so good a Cuppe. Begyn Monke, sayd the Kynge: and the Monke dranke a grete draught, and toke the Kynge the Cuppe, and the Kynge dranke also a grete draught, and set downe the Cuppe. The Monke anone ryght wente in to farmerye [infirmary] and there dyed anone, on whoos soule God have mercy, Amen. And fyve Monkes synge for his soul specially, and shall whyle that the Abbaye standeth. The Kynge rose up anone full evyll at ease, and commaunded to remove the table, and axed after the Monke; and men tolde him that hee was deed, for his wombe [belly] was broken in sundre. Whan the Kynge herde this, he commaunded for to trusse, but it was for nought, for his belly began to swelle for the drynke that he had dronke, and within two dayes hee deyed, on the morowe after saynt Lukis daye.</p>

            <p>That &#8216;great toad&#8217; found in the garden at Swineshead could only have been the common toad of western Europe, bufo vulgaris. This is the same toad that George Ripley, a writer on alchemy, saw in a vision late in the 15<sup>th</sup> century, and commemorated in curious verse. His short poem, which we reproduce as it first appeared in print, eloquently expresses medieval man&#8217;s repugnance for the toad, and reveals how intimate Ripley and his circle must have been with the toad&#8217;s milky exudate and its fearsome virtue.</p>

            <p>Our quotations concerning the toad go back to the Middle Ages and
                the Renaissance, but the ideas therein expressed lived on until
                recent times. One William Northcote, for many years a surgeon in
                His Majesty&#8217;s Navy, published in London in 1770 a serious medical
                work, <i>The Marine Practice of Physic and Surgery,</i> a
                reference book for use on ships. In it there is a chapter on
                poisons, and coming to the toad, Mr. Northcote has surprising
                things to say:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The toad is full of venom, and the very centre and repository of terrestrial poisons... they discharge their venom on herbs (particularly strawberries) by pissing, spitting, and vomiting; this is not only pernicious by getting into the body, but by being sprinkled on the skin, unless washed off immediately with urine and salt.</p>

                <p>When a person is infected, his skin turns yellow, his body swells universally, his lips and tongue grow black, and a stammering supervenes; he is seized with an asthmatic shortness of breath, vomiting, cold sweats, convulsions, fainting, and at length with death, if not timely remedied, [p. 421]</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Mr. Northcote is guilty of patent absurdities, but the fact remains that we can not deny for sure his clinical description of the victims of toad poisoning, for modern medical records offer us no histories of such cases. This seasoned practitioner of the 18<sup>th</sup> century was closer than we, chronologically, to the era when men knew the properties of the toad&#8217;s venom, and his account of the symptoms is the only one emanating from a medical pen known to us. It stands thus uncorroborated and unchallenged, a wisp of dubious expert testimony in what would otherwise be a scientific vacuum.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b1-fn5" id="cp5b1-r5">[5]</a></sup></p>

            <p>There exists an additional body of evidence of a different order testifying to the toad&#8217;s sinister grip on the popular imagination in times gone by. Men take refuge in euphemisms when they talk about things that move them profoundly. People &#8216;pass away&#8217; rather than &#8216;die&#8217;, and Satan becomes the &#8216;Evil One&#8217;. Abhorred creatures are called out of their names, or else their names are subjected to irregular distortions in sound.</p>

            <p>In the languages of Europe few creatures can compete with the toad for evasive nomenclature. The measure of this tabu lies in the number of etymologically unrelated words for it, not to speak of the variety of dialectical variants for each word. Here are a few of the important ones: in Latin <i>bufo,</i> and in Italian, <i>rospo</i> and <i>botta;</i> in Spanish, <i>sapo</i> and <i>escuerzo;</i> in French, <i>crapaud</i> and <i>hot;</i> in German, <i>Krote;</i> in Russian, <i>zhaba;</i> around the North Sea, <i>padde;</i> and in English, &#8216;toad&#8217;. An abundance of diverse names like this makes difficulties for the philologist, who has more to show for his efforts when he goes coursing through the Indo-European languages after words like &#8216;wolf and &#8216;fox&#8217;, words that turn up in more or less regular mutations in various languages. Some of the words for &#8216;toad&#8217; defeat the philologists completely. Take &#8216;toad&#8217; itself. It exists in several variations in English, of which &#8216;tad&#8217;, as in &#8216;tadpole&#8217;, is the most important. It is genetically related to the three-syllabled variants in Anglo-Saxon, <i>tadie</i> and <i>tadije.</i> There the trail is lost: no remoter ancestry is known for the word, and it has no kin in other tongues.</p>

            <p>We believe that all, or almost all, of the words for &#8216;toad&#8217; in Europe can be explained, if we look for the figures of speech that are latent in them by focusing our attention on the creature itself. Instead of attacking the &#8216;toad&#8217; problem by frontal assault, let us approach by a postern gate, viz., through the Celtic languages. We know the words for &#8216;toad&#8217; in five Celtic languages, and, as befits a creature veiled by tabu, the five words appear to be unrelated to each other. From ancient Gaul <i>craxantus</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b1-fn6" id="cp5b1-r6">[6]</a></sup> survives in a single citation. In Cornish the toad was <i>croinoc</i> or <i>cronec,</i> and this meant &#8216;the skin&#8217; or &#8216;the hide&#8217;, from <i>croin,</i> meaning skin. The Cornishman referred to the toad by its skin, covered as it is with pustules, and notorious for the way the creature blows itself up with air like a sac when making its eerie call. In Welsh the toad is the <i>llyffant;</i> this appears to mean &#8216;the slimy one,&#8217; with obvious reference to the slippery secretions of the skin. The common toad does not exist in Ireland, and the only toad reported there is the bufo calamita, known in English as the natterjack. Its range in Ireland is so limited that almost no natives have ever seen a toad: the natterjack has been found in historic times only over an area of some twenty square miles, around Castlemaine Harbor at the head of Dingle Bay in Kerry. The expression for &#8216;toad&#8217; in Irish is &#8216;the poisonous frog&#8217; &#8212;&#8203; <i>losgann nimhe;</i> and since the word for frog &#8212;&#8203; <i>losgann </i> &#8212;&#8203; means &#8216;the burning one&#8217;, we arrive ultimately at &#8216;the poisonous burning one&#8217; &#8212;&#8203; a doubled reference to the toxic, stinging secretion of the pustules.</p>

            <p>Now we turn to the Breton language, and here perhaps we discover a loose end to Ariadne&#8217;s thread, a possible clue to our problem. The word for toad in Breton is <i>tousec.</i> It comes from the Latin <i>toxicum,</i> and therefore means &#8216;the poisonous one&#8217;. On an earlier page we said that the standard word for &#8216;toadstool&#8217; in Breton is <i>kabell tousec,</i> wherein <i>kabell</i> (from the Low Latin <i>cappa</i> and <i>capello]</i> means &#8216;cap&#8217;. When the early Bretons spoke of the toadstool as the <i>kabell tousec,</i> the term meant to them &#8216;the poison cap&#8217;, as well as the toad&#8217;s cap; and the variant <i>skabell tousec</i> could have meant &#8216;the poison stool&#8217; as well as the toad&#8217;s stool.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b1-fn7" id="cp5b1-r7">[7]</a></sup></p>

            <p>In Britain, the island that the Bretons had left behind, are we surprised to discover that the Anglo-Saxon word <i>tosca</i> meant toad? It is, we submit, identical to the Breton word, offspring of <i>toxicum,</i> and another example of&#8217;the poisonous one&#8217;. We have mentioned the English name for the bufo calami ta&#8212;&#8203;the natterjack. We believe that the root of this word is to be found in the Anglo-Saxon word for poison <i>-ator;</i> a word that as &#8216;etter&#8217; survived in English for centuries, and still circulates in dialect, to designate the venom of a reptile, and the corrupt matter that oozes from a suppurating ulcer or abscess. An &#8216;attercop&#8217; is an old word for a (supposedly poisonous) spider. In modern Dutch <i>etter</i> still means pus. If we are right, what we now call &#8216;a natterjack&#8217; was once &#8216;an atterjack&#8217;, the shuttling V being a well known linguistic quirk. The jack&#8217; is simply the same element that we find in the jumping-jack&#8217;. The &#8216;atterjack&#8217; is then a &#8216;poison jack&#8217;, and an Anglo-Saxon rendering of the Latinism <i>tosca.</i></p>

            <p>Let us pause on <i>tosca,</i> that long forgotten word for the toad. It had a doublet in Anglo-Saxon, <i>taxe,</i> which survives in a single citation. The alternation in the vowels reminds us of &#8216;toad&#8217; and &#8216;tad&#8217;, and also of a parallel in Latin: <i>toxicum</i> meaning &#8216;poison&#8217; and <i>taxus,</i> &#8216;yew&#8217;. In antiquity the yew was notorious as a poisonous tree, and the adjective <i>taxicus</i> was popularly associated with <i>toxicum.</i> In Greek TO^OV meant &#8216;bow&#8217; and &#8216;arrow&#8217; and &#8216;bow-and-arrows&#8217;. Philologists are inclined to deny a link between the Greek and the Latin words, and even between the Latin words themselves, but concede that the problem is unclear. Until we know more about the role of bows and poisoned arrows in early magic and myth, it is well to suspend judgment. Bows were made of yew, and arrow-heads were smeared with poison, perhaps from yew. Robert Graves has pointed out<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b1-fn8" id="cp5b1-r8">[8]</a></sup> that arrow-heads were sometimes knapped with double tangs to resemble the yew. The making of such arrow-heads demanded far more patience and skill than the simple willow-leaf and elder-leaf points, and would be less effective in hunting or fighting. They must have been ceremonial in function and were undoubtedly bathed in <i>mana.</i> As we look back in recorded history, our &#8216;toad&#8217; or &#8216;tad&#8217; emerges from the Anglo-Saxon world as the venomous helpmeet of sorcerers. The very name of the creature, <i>tousec</i> or <i>tosca</i> or <i>taxe,</i> is redolent with poison, potent with <i>mana.</i> Down through the Middle Ages and into modern times the toad was still freighted with this primitive cargo of evil. <i>Tosca</i> and <i>taxe</i> may have contributed to the shaping of our words &#8216;toad&#8217; and &#8216;tad&#8217;. As we said before, the etymology of &#8216;toad&#8217; is unknown. We must consider the possibility that, by steps that may forever remain obscure, the Anglo-Saxon words come down to us in &#8216;toad&#8217; and &#8216;tad&#8217; by lineal descent. The irregular mutation of <i>-sc-</i> and <i>-x-</i> into &#8216;d&#8217; could have been a euphemistic substitution.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b1-fn9" id="cp5b1-r9">[9]</a></sup></p>

            <p>If &#8216;toad&#8217; descends etymologically to us from <i>toxicum,</i> then in English as in the Breton tongue a &#8216;toadstool&#8217; in its ultimate meaning is a &#8216;poison stool&#8217;, and the idea of poison, rather than the toad, may have been dominant in the minds of those who first applied this term to the wild fungi in the Anglo-Saxon world. In any case, whatever the etymology, the cultural soil in which &#8216;toad&#8217; had its beginnings explains that aura of abhorrence which bathes the word to this day in the English language. We discover why the Oxford Dictionary fails to satisfy us when it dismisses the problem of the toadstool by calling it a &#8216;fanciful&#8217; term. We realize why the headline in <i>The Times,</i> EDIBLE TOADSTOOLS, shocks us as a contradiction in terms.</p>

            <p>We have already observed that the Irish word for &#8216;frog&#8217; is the &#8216;burning one&#8217;. Here again the reference is to the secretion of the epidermal glands of the amphibian, the secretion that stings when it comes into touch with a mucous membrane. This Irish word has its parallels in certain of the Germanic languages. In Old High German the verb &#8216;to burn&#8217; was <i>zusken,</i> and by regular mutation of sounds this explains the Danish word for the toad, <i>tudse,</i> in which today the letter <i>d</i> is silent. In Swedish the corresponding word is <i>tossa,</i> with dialectical variants <i>tosk</i> and <i>tusk;</i> and there also survives a citation from 1652 in the form <i>tadza,</i> pronounced perhaps as &#8216;totsa&#8217; would be in English. In all these words the toad is called the &#8216;burning one&#8217;, as the frog is in Irish. These words find their semantic parallel in the vulgar Dutch term <i>paddescheet,</i> the stye with its burning sting, to which we called attention earlier. In Greek the word for toad, βάτραχος, is usually explained as meaning &#8216;the brown one&#8217;, but brown is the burnt color, and Professor Andre Martinet has suggested that βάτραχος; may refer to burning rather than to the color.</p>

            <p>We know that the secretion of toads was used by the practitioners of witchcraft. We know that in ancient Rome the lethal properties of the wild fungus known as the deadly amanita or destroying angel or death cup were familiar to the practitioners of venomy, as we choose to call the art of murder by poison. But no positive evidence survives, so far as we know, to show that in the practice of witchcraft the secrets of the fungi were utilized; no evidence, that is, beyond &#8216;toadstool&#8217; itself, this humble folkword with its secret message. Does the absence of positive evidence mean that the toadstool was not used in the practices of the Old Religion, or that the secret was successfully kept? For the present we leave the answer to the reader.</p>

                    If Latin <i>-x-</i> became <i>-s-</i> in
                    <i>tosca,</i> then the Anglo-Saxon word results
                    from the omission of the middle syllable,
                    <i>toxicum</i> becoming <i>tos&#8217;ca.</i> But
                    if <i>-x-</i> by phonetic transposition became
                    <i>-sc-</i> we arrive directly at <i>tosca</i> by
                    the ero sion of the last syllable. If <i>taxe</i>
                    or a hypothetical <i>toxe</i> became by
                    euphemistic mutation <i>tadse</i> or <i>todse,</i>
                    the evolu tion into &#8216;toad&#8217; or
                    &#8216;tad&#8217; is easy, the sibilant being lost
                    by a popular back-formation of an erroneous
                    singular; cf. &#8216;toad&#8217;s stool&#8217;
                    which becomes &#8216;toad-stool&#8217;; also
