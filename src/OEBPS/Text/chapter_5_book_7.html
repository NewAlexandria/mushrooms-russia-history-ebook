        <h2>Punk, Fire and Love</h2>
        <div class="main">
            <p>About the things that man eats he is acutely sensitive. The mere thought of inviting food starts up his salivary glands, and puts him on tiptoe of eager expectation. By contrast, the suggestion that he consume things unclean gives him a spasm of revulsion. The attitudes that we have called mycophilia and mycophobia hinge on whether fungi are considered delectable food or foul and filthy poison. But primitive man had other uses for wild fungi, and he was capable of regarding these growths from a detached utilitarian point of view without regard to ingestion. We believe this explains the neutral tone of the sponge cluster of words. These words are often bestowed on edible fungi, but they usually yield place to others in the context of food -&nbsp;<i>Pilz, grib, champignon.</i> If we try to see the fungi as our ancestors saw them, we may divide their thoughts and feelings about them according to the ends they had in mind:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>INGESTION</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>As poison (a) accidental (b) for murder</li>
                    <li>As intoxicant (amanita muscaria), and for divination</li>
                    <li>As aphrodisiac (including perfume)</li>
                    <li>As medicine-purgative, styptic, etc. (fomes omcinalis); for contraception</li>
                    <li>As food</li>
                </ol>

                <li>OTHER</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>As tinder or touchwood, to catch the spark and start the fire, and to keep a fire in a smouldering state.</li>
                    <li>To produce a stupefying smoke, effective with bees when extracting honey from the hive, etc.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>

            <p>Modern man, especially the urbanized literate, is almost incapable of imagining the importance to his ancestors of fungi for the making of fire. One species was especially prized for this purpose &mdash; the fomes fomentarius, the&nbsp;<i>amadouvier</i> of France, the <i>Zunderschwamm</i> or <i>Feuerschivamm</i> of Germany. But many other kinds served this purpose too, such as 'bunts&rsquo; or dried puffballs, and the dry, friable innards of fungous-infested tree-stumps.</p>

            <p>This brings us to a curious trio of English words, 'punk', 'spunk', and 'funk'. We believe all three are members of our sponge cluster, siblings descended from the Mediterranean <i>fimgus-</i> σπόγγος word family. All three possess one thing in common: they designate, or at some time in the past have designated, the shelf-fungi that serve as touchwood for making fire. This meaning is not the oldest recorded use of any of them, but nevertheless as a working hypothesis we propose that &lsquo;touchwood&rsquo; be regarded as their primary sense, in which sense they circulated in humble discourse for untold centuries, accumulating derived and metaphorical meanings as time went on, until finally, when the words were consigned to paper, it was these secondary and more fashionable meanings that first achieved the dignity of writing.</p>

            <p>Let us take &lsquo;spunk', for example. That it belongs to our sponge cluster is attested by the corresponding Irish word&nbsp;<i>sponnc,</i>&nbsp;which means both sponge and touchwood. (We find a similar semantic association in Dutch, where <i>zwam</i>&nbsp;means both fungus and tinder; for &lsquo;sponge&rsquo; the Dutch resort to&nbsp;<i>spons.)</i> In the Oxford Dictionary's earliest citation of'spunk', in 1536, the word meant &lsquo;spark'; to this day it is still occasionally so used. In 1582 it appears in the sense of tinder, and in 1665 as the name of the fungus that makes tinder. Oliver Goldsmith toward the end of the i8th century offers us the earliest known use of &lsquo;spunk&rsquo; as the moral quality of mettle or pluck. Here in the word &lsquo;spunk&rsquo; we have a name for touchwood that gathered to itself nobler secondary meanings derived from the spark that was the end-product of its use. The word &lsquo;spark&rsquo; itself is mysterious: it is known only in the English, Frisian, and Low German languages. The question suggests itself whether it is not simply a different phase or grade of'spunk&rsquo; &mdash; touchwood in its final act of transfiguration.</p>

            <p>'Funk&rsquo; also meant &lsquo;spark&rsquo; in the earliest citations, in the I4th century. We first hear of it as fungous touchwood in 1673. Haifa century earlier it was being used in the sense of a strong smoke and stench, as from tobacco. This use stems back to the shelf-fungi that served to generate a stupefying smoke, to put bees to sleep when extracting honey from hives. Before modern sugars became common, honey was a commodity of notable importance, both for its sweetness and as the base for mead, and in the apiculture of the time, the part played by fungal smoke was important and a commonplace. It was natural that those who disapproved of tobacco in the early days should have first associated this smoking plant with the familiar smoke-generating fungus. The depressing moral connotations of &lsquo;funk&rsquo; first appear in the i8th century: he who languishes in a funk is in a moral stupor, overcome in a smoke-cloud.</p>

            <p>Most interesting of the three words is &lsquo;punk', which in the sense of touchwood first appears about 1707. As with the other two words, the lexicographers say that the origin of &lsquo;punk&rsquo; is obscure, but they give reserved recognition to a theory that it was borrowed in colonial times from an Algonquin word, phonetically similar, meaning dust or ashes. &lsquo;Punk&rsquo; is the ordinary English word for touchwood today, and it is <i>prima facie</i> incredible that an Algonquin term for so ancient and domestic a commodity should have swept the English-speaking world and won general acceptance late in cultural history. We think there is circumstantial evidence to show that the word was securely established in English in Elizabethan times, and this leads us directly into the strange erotic associations of our punk-spunk-funk triplets.</p>

            <p>In the 16<sup>th</sup> century &lsquo;punk&rsquo; meant a strumpet, as it still does, and what is a strumpet but the tinder that whips into flame the gay young spark allured by her favors? Let no one dismiss this figure as fanciful. For &lsquo;touchwood&rsquo; the French say <i>amadou,</i> which is simply the Proven&ccedil;al word for &lsquo;lover'. Lovers, like tinder, are quick to take fire. The French verb <i>amadouer</i> means to coax, just as we &lsquo;coax&rsquo; a fire with tinder. In modern English slang &lsquo;punk&rsquo; is a contemptuous adjective for things of low quality &mdash; a natural semantic extension of the brothel word. The erotic association of &lsquo;punk&rsquo; is feminine. That of &lsquo;spunk&rsquo; is primarily masculine: in certain English circles and at certain levels of conversation, it is the accepted word for the seminal fluid of the human male. &lsquo;Sparking&rsquo; a girl used to mean &lsquo;courting&rsquo; in American slang, and the <i>Dictionary of American English</i> also records the far stronger &lsquo;spunking'. We have seen how the nasal infix of the words of our sponge cluster comes and goes, associating this large verbal family with the <i>pogge</i> constellation. If we drop from &lsquo;funk&rsquo; its nasal infix, we are in the presence of the supreme erotic word of the English language. The Russian word for touchwood is <i>trut</i> (riming with &lsquo;brute'), and it is directly derived from the Russian word for &lsquo;rub'. Though <i>trut</i> itself carries no erotic meaning, it is the key to certain ancient Russian riddles where the erotic sense lies hidden. The generating of fire by the friction of wooden surfaces &mdash; a technique in which one wood must be soft and the other hard &mdash; may explain why, among the many forms that &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; has taken in English, we find &lsquo;mushrub'.</p>

            <p>And now the thread of our argument leads us from philological clues over the threshold into anthropology, where we begin to discover the deep erotic symbolism of the mushroom world.</p>

            <p>Throughout most of human history and down into our own times, men have usually made fire by either of two methods &mdash; by percussion, striking flint against pyrites or (in later times) against iron to generate sparks that will ignite tinder, or by the friction of wood on wood through the aid of a simple device for which the English anthropologist Edward B. Tylor devised the name &lsquo;fire- drill&rsquo; in the last century. The usual fire-drill consists of two wooden members, a flat smooth piece of soft wood held horizontal, and a round stick of harder wood. The stick is pivoted perpendicularly in a notch on the horizontal face of the soft wood, and then rapidly rotated, sometimes between the hands but more often with the aid of an ingeniously disposed thong or strap or bow-string. A pulsating pressure is applied to the rotating stick, as it rotates first clockwise and then counter-clockwise. The stick by friction widens and deepens the hole in the soft wood, and fine wood-dust gathering in the hole becomes red hot, until when tinder is applied to it, by blowing the tinder catches fire. For us the interesting thing is that among the peoples who use the fire-drill, the horizontal piece of soft wood is called the &lsquo;female&rsquo; and is sometimes even carved crudely to suggest a human figure, and the stick is called the &lsquo;male'. The engendering of the fire is regarded as a sexual act, and is pregnant with emotional significance and hallowed by mythological overtones.</p>

            <p>Over the past century there have been published a number of papers by anthropologists on the methods used by our ancestors and other early peoples for kindling fire.[1] The percussion method can be traced to remote times, thanks to the survival of the artifacts employed &mdash; the flints and the irons, and the masses of decomposing pyrites used before the iron age. By contrast, the perishable fire-drill &mdash; the wooden members that by friction yield fire &mdash; must generally be studied among our primitive contemporaries, although Egyptian records establish its use in ancient Egypt. These two primitive methods for making fire, percussion and friction, survive to this day by lineal descent in our &lsquo;lighters&rsquo; (the French <i>briquets]</i> and matches.</p>

            <p>Our own interest lies in tinder, that humble but indispensable condiment in the generation of fire, the highly inflammable material, otherwise worthless, that is the nexus between the spark on the one hand and the kindling on the other. The kinds of tinder that have been used in various parts of the world are many: charred rags, lint, down, the flower stalk of the agave, dried moss, dried bark, and fungi. Many kinds of fungi have served this purpose, including ordinary mushrooms in a dried state, puffballs, and, according to the classical lexicons, the fomes officinalis &mdash; the <i>agaricum</i> or &lsquo;female agaricke&rsquo; of the old pharmacopoeias. (While this medicinal shelf fungus could certainly have served the spark-catching function, we have found no classical text supporting the lexicons, and its value as medicine would seem to have made the humbler service unlikely, especially as it had to be imported from beyond the Bosphorus.) Down to our own times the writers about tinder have almost always been confusing in their use of fungal names: they have seldom been competent in the technicalities of the industry that served the market with commercial tinder. We believe, however, that there is agreement among competent students: in medieval and renaissance times, and indeed into our own era, the best commercial tinder of Northern Europe was always made from the shelf-fungus known to mycologists as the fomes fornentarius, a species that must not be confused with the mis-named fomes igniarius. Indeed, today we know that this use of the fomes fomentarius for tinder goes back far. It has been found in the human settlements at Maglemose, on the island of Seeland in Denmark, in conjunction with flint and the remains of pyrites.[2] It has been found repeatedly in the Danish peat bogs of the same era. The Maglemose finds go back to the oldest stone age in Denmark, c. 6,000 B.C. The final ice age had drawn to a close c. 12,000 B.C., and after an interval of tundra ecology, a forest growth succeeded, including the birch trees with which invariably the early specimens of fomes fomentarius have been associated. The making of tinder from this particular fungus may well be the oldest surviving industry with a continuous history in northern Europe. We suggest as an hypothesis that this fungus was the object to which the name <i>Schwamm</i> or &lsquo;punk&rsquo; in earlier forms was originally bestowed. These words dealt with the fungal world from a utilitarian point of view, not gustatory; with inedible shelf fungi, not mushrooms. This would account for the emotional neutrality of the sponge cluster of words, as contrasted with the pronounced values, negative or positive, of &lsquo;toadstool', <i>'champignon',</i> and many others. Or rather, to speak with more precision, this would account for the two distinct emotional responses evoked by mushroomic words. Where ingestion is concerned, the response, whether favorable or unfavorable, is sharp and keyed to the gustatory sense. Where fire-making is concerned, the archaic emotion that lingers on in such words as &lsquo;punk&rsquo; and &lsquo;spunk&rsquo; is an erotic transfer.</p>

            <p>In ancient Greece the god of fire-making was Ixion. He hailed from Mount Pelion, a center of Helladic culture, where he fathered the Lapiths, the Satyrs, and the Centaurs, tribes that were kin to the Etruscans and that enjoyed singular repute for sexual potency. According to the myth, Ixion was bound to a great wheel (the sun-wheel) and sent spinning for eternity into space because he had permitted himself to become enamored of Hera. Before this sentence was meted out, unbeknownst to him his guilt was proven by trickery: a cloud was made to condense into the figure of Hera, and Ixion did not resist temptation.</p>

            <p>In the British Museum there is an Etruscan mirror, variously attributed to the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, or 5<sup>th</sup> centuries B.C., on which Ixion is depicted undergoing his punishment. Nude, bound to a seven-spoked wheel, he is in the running posture that denotes speed. Between the spokes of the wheel we discover two designs, of which one is almost entirely lost. The scholar A. B. Cook, describing this mirror in his work on Zeus, dismissed these signs as meaningless. But it will be observed that the two designs are not components of the ornamental border. They are functional elements in the iconographic message. They possess a meaning, but what meaning? Robert Graves, who drew them to our attention, suggests that they are mushrooms. He is surely right, and if so, this Etruscan mirror offers us the earliest known representations of fungi in European art; and we observe that the role they here play is related not to food or poison but to the generation of fire. The eroticism of the design tells us a story intimately linked with the Ixion myth. On one level we see a capped mushroom representing no particular species. On another level we observe that the mushroom consists of two members, symbolizing the male and female organs of a fire-drill, and they are engaged in the supreme act of fire generation. Earlier we have suggested that certain basic words for the fungi are keyed to words for the womb. We now remind our readers that the Greek word for mushroom, P.UXYJ?, also means the <i>membmm virile.[3]</i> There are the same bi-sexual correspondences in the mushroom vocabulary that anthropologists discover in the names for the two parts of the fire-drill. The pattern that we discover on the Etruscan mirror is, we think, a pictograph symbolizing the generation of fire, the function of Ixion. This interpretation is in harmony with the verbal and semantic ties that, by independent evidence, we have discovered in Europe's mushroom vocabulary. The artist of the Etruscan mirror offers us three messages in one design &mdash; a fire-drill in the act of generating fire, a sexual performance, and the mushroom with stipe stabbing the pileus (i.e., μύκης and vulva) that is the symbol of the other two.[4]</p>

            <p>The medicinal shelf fungus known today as the fomes officinalis used to be called in English the &lsquo;female agaricke'. This sexual attribution in one form or another goes back to Dioscorides and Pliny. The explanation that they offer for it seems a little forced. According to them, the female agaric possessed straight veins resembling the teeth of a comb, and was white and light through-out, at first sweet to the taste and then bitter &mdash; an observation that suggests a cynical view of womankind. This was the only kind recommended for medicinal use, and the description fits the fomes officinahs. The &lsquo;male agaricke', which seems to have been a term applicable to the fomes fomentarius and fomes igniarius, was brown or reddish, sticky, long, hard, and heavy. These descriptions, more suggestive erotically than enlightening mycologically, originated in the ancient authorities, but were repeated tirelessly until we find them in such English pharmacopoeias as William Salmon's <i>Pharmacopoeia Londi-</i> <i>nensis, or the New London Dispensatory,</i> London, 1682, and <i>A Treatise on Foreign</i> <i>Vegetables,</i> by Ralph Thicknesse, M.D., London, 1749.</p>

            <p>We can adduce startling evidence proving the hold on the Greek imagination of the sexual associations of shelf fungi. In a loth century Byzantine codex of Dioscorides now owned by The Pierpont Morgan Library, the section on the άγαρικόν is illustrated by the miniaturist, but his design bears no resemblance to the fomes officinahs! He must have been totally ignorant of it. Drawing his knowledge solely from the text with its account of the male and female kinds, he has given us two drawings inspired by the male and female genital organs! Our loth century miniaturist may have been copying an earlier manuscript, but we know not how far back this aberration goes. Some five centuries later, in the year 1491, in the earliest printed book carrying fungal illustrations, the artist was clear and accurate in his delineation of the <i>agaricum</i> (Fig. 7).</p>

            <p>Fungi and fire &mdash; the tie that weds these two disparate elements was indeed old, strong, and far-reaching. Consider the following additional evidence. In ancient Greece there was a mushroom that bore the name κεραύνιον. This word, like <i>joudre</i> in French, conveys the idea of both thunder and lightning, and the mushroom designated by it was therefore the &lsquo;thunderbolt-fungus'. We do not know exactly what species it was, but in Latin it was rendered contemporaneously by <i>tuber,</i> and therefore it was probably an underground growth, perhaps a truffle or a species of terfezia. Many ancient writers refer to the common belief that thunderbolts made this fungus grow plentifully. Galen speaks of it. Plutarch in his <i>Convivial Essays</i> devotes a table conversation to the question why thunder should engender &lsquo;thunderbolt&rsquo; fungi, an essay both graceful and unenlightening. Pliny the Elder in his <i>Historia Naturalis,</i> in Book xix, is careful to distinguish between the influence of the rain and of the thunderbolts: it is not the rain but the thunder that makes the mushrooms grow. Pliny sounds as though he were simply repeating a tiresome adage, after the manner of those who say it is not the heat but the humidity that causes distress in summer. Juvenal in <i>Satire</i> v: 116 speaks of the longed-for thunder in springtime that replenishes the table with mushrooms:</p>

            <blockquote>Post hunc tradentur tubera, si ver tune erit et facient optata tonitrua cenas maiores.</blockquote>

            <p>Athenasus, writing in the 3rd century after Christ, quotes Theophrastus five centuries earlier on certain unidentified underground fungi called οἰτόν in Thrace:</p>

            <blockquote>
                Concerning these a singular fact is related, viz., that they grow when autumn rains come with severe thunderstorms; the more thundering there is, the more they grow, the presumption being that this is the more important cause. [BOOK n: 62]
            </blockquote>

            <p>One could not demand better documentation for this ancient notion which the most intelligent men of the day accepted without question. What explanation is there for it; Plutarch had none. Modern mycologists have none. Does thunder perhaps shake the soil and precipitate a crop of fungi that would otherwise emerge over weeks? There is no evidence to support this. We believe that the classical writers were repeating words whose portentous religious meaning was already in their time forgotten.</p>

            <p>The ancient belief must have survived the classic world, but we have found only one sure evidence of it in modern Europe. In Littre under <i>tniffe</i> we read the statement that when it thunders, people in some parts of the French countryside say, "Voila un bon temps pour les truftes" — "There's fine weather for truffles."[6] Professor Georg Morgenstierne of Oslo, however, has turned up for us amazing data proving that the link between fire and fungi lingers on to this day in certain parts of Asia. (To Professor Morgenstierne we are deeply indebted for all our information concerning the Iranian and Indie languages.) In Kashmir the gilled mushrooms known as <i>hedur</i> and <i>henda</i> are said to be engendered by thunder. They are eaten by both Hindus and Muslims, cooked with ghee; they are preserved by drying and used in broths and stews. The mountains of Kashmir produce great quantities of another mushroom, <i>kana-g"ch,</i> which means &lsquo;ear-morel', and it too emerges from the earth in response to thunder.</p>

            <p>More remarkable still is the testimony from that valley southeast of Samarkand where Yaghnobi is spoken, a dialect descended from the ancient Sogdian language, related to Persian and of course belonging to the Indo-European family. The folk who speak this tongue believe that when the highest god shakes his winter coat, the air is rent with thunder, and then the children must say:</p>

            <blockquote>
                Katta xarcak man, pullja xarcak tau.<br>
                The big mushroom is for me, the small one for you.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Not far away, in the upper Zarafshan valley where we find a Persian dialect known as Tadzhik, the children cry, "Puri, puri, xorc", xorc'meaning &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; and <i>puri</i> being a thick-stalked annual that springs up early in the season and quickly dies away, both stalk and root being eaten raw by the natives. Someone should tell us which mushroom these children near the Pamirs have in mind. In Yaghnobi, and also in Tadzhik as spoken in the vicinity of the town of Match, there survives an old belief that when the divinity known as <i>Mama,</i> &lsquo;Grandmother', shakes her baggy trousers, she lets fly a swarm of lice to the earth, and from those lice, after thunder storms, an abundance of mushrooms spring up.[7] Today in Persia the common word for &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; is <i>qarc,</i> but there is one kind, perhaps a terfezia, that is called <i>dumbalan</i> (plural of <i>dumbal,</i> &lsquo;boil', &lsquo;pustule', &lsquo;bubo'), and people say they grow in the desert &lsquo;after thunderstorms'.</p>

            <p>Again thanks to Professor Morgenstierne, we are able to pin-point the earliest reference in surviving Sanskrit literature to this belief in the &lsquo;thunder-mushroom'. It is in Kalidasa's lyrical poem <i>Meghaduta,</i> &lsquo;The Cloud Messenger', written about A.D. 400. In verse n the exiled <i>yaksha</i> or demigod addresses the rain-cloud drifting northward over India:</p>

            <blockquote>
                ... and when they hear thy sweet-sounding, fertilizing thunder, which is able to cover the earth with mushrooms. . .
            </blockquote>

            <p>The word used for &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; here is <i>s'ilmdhra,</i> of unknown derivation, probably taken over by Sanskrit from some earlier unrelated tongue of India. <i>'Sili'</i> might mean a frog or toad, and then <i>-dhra</i> would mean &lsquo;carrying': &lsquo;toad-carrier&rsquo; or something akin to our &lsquo;toadstool'. But this tempting explanation of the ancient word is far from established.</p>

            <p>Is it not deeply stirring to contemplate these surviving traces of a folk association uniting thunderbolts with fungi &mdash; a belief accepted by ancient Greece and Rome, queried by Plutarch, and holding on in Kashmir and the Pamirs? Angelo de Gubernatis in the second volume of his <i>Mythologie des Plantes</i> (Paris, 1882), when he discusses mushrooms, observes that the solar hero was said sometimes in antiquity to hide behind a mushroom, and he supposes that by &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; a cloud was meant. The direct and simple meaning seems preferable. The solar hero, a projection of divine fire, lies dormant for the nonce in fungal tinder, ready to leap forth on divine command, just as the dormant φαλλός; rises in ίθύ-φαλλος. Here then is a partial answer to Plutarch's question: the fungi, saturated in sexual associations, are intimately associated as tinder with the making of fire, and fire expresses metaphorically the procreative act. On every plane the fungal world is redolent with the spirit of generation. Even the phosphorescence that some fungi emit must have deepened the mystery, augmented the awe. The very fungi were called into being by the gods, by those bolts of celestial fire hurled to earth with the crackling and deafening roar of thunder.</p>

            <p>Let us pursue this theme further, to the very core of ancient Rome's religious beliefs. Rome's eponymous heroes sprang from the union of divine fire with vestal virgins, and fungi seem to have been officially present at the consummation. Sir James Frazer in <i>The Golden Bough</i> summarized the legends and pointed out their meaning.[8] It seems that when Ocrisia, handmaiden to Tanaquil the wife of King Tarquin the Elder, was offering cakes and libations of wine on the royal hearth, a flame assumed the shape of the male member and shot forth from the fire, impregnating her with a child who was destined to reign as Servius Tullius. The child's divine paternity was well attested later when an aureole of lambent flame was seen to play around his head. Concerning Romulus and Remus Plutarch records a similar legend, which he took from Promathion's <i>History of Rome:</i> in the house of the king of Alba there hovered over the hearth for days a phantasma in the shape of the male organ of generation, which in the end, by one of the handmaidens, gave being to the twins.[9]</p>

            <p>Nowhere in surviving versions of these legends are fungi mentioned. What then was our surprise when we discovered that Professor Arthur Stanley Pease of Harvard University, in a note in <i>Classical Philology</i> in 1947, urged that a natural phenomenon be sought to explain these miracles and volunteered the surmise that the key would be found in the mushroom that he called the ithyphallus impudicus, that astonishing fungus which from its sac or cod shoots forth to its proud height in the course of minutes. This, says Professor Pease, is what underlay Ovid's line in the <i>Fasti,</i> vi: 631:</p>

            <blockquote>.. . hie inter cineris obsceni forma virilis.</blockquote>

            <p>Professor Pease's happy suggestion may be refined. The morel, though far removed in mycological classification from the phallus impudicus, embodies in its shape the same erotic symbol, and unlike the phalloidacese shows a remark- able predilection for sites of wood fires. J. G. Gleditsch in his <i>Methodus Fungorum,</i> published in Berlin in 1753, told[10] how just recently the old peasant women of Brandenburg, observing this predilection, had taken to making bonfires in the woods to induce the growth of morels, causing thereby so many forest fires that the authorities had banned the practice. Dr. Ramsbottom in his <i>Mushrooms &amp; Toadstools</i> reports that during and after the first World War the sites of burned houses in northern France and of abandoned trenches became veritable gardens of morels, and he also relates a personal experience confirming this biological nexus between morels and fired places. Indeed this affinity is a commonplace of fungal lore.</p>

            <p>We place then a morel rather than the stinkhorn in those ancient hearths of Rome's eponymous founders. And this leads us to venture a daring conjecture concerning the origin of the Greek work for &lsquo;mushroom', μύκης. In modern times we are in a position to observe how the words of the sponge cluster &mdash; the basic words for the fungi in common Indo-European &mdash; yield place sometimes to other words that express a fashionable facet of man's evolving attitude toward the fungal world. From a name for a single edible species, <i>mousseron</i> in &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; becomes a designation for any edible species and even for all species. The French <i>champignon,</i> once applied only to the common field mushroom, acquired over-shadowing importance when the art of its cultivation was mastered, and now this word embraces in French all fungi, even the microscopic kinds. In German <i>Pilz</i> is a newcomer, but already competes with <i>Schwamm,</i> and in Russian <i>guba</i> has largely surrendered the field to the toothsome <i>grib.</i> Thanks to the importance of a particular mushroom species, its specific name can become generic. In Greek σπόγγος lost its fungal meaning early &mdash; the surviving records never report it &mdash; and its terrain was wholly occupied by μύκης. What potent forces could have caused this early substitution? Our surmise is that μύκης originally was the name of the morel, and that its awesome religious and magical meaning, its link with the generation of fire and divine procreation, so far eclipsed all other fungal associations that it took over the whole semantic area of the fungi. The Greeks never won honors in mycophagy and there was no competition from fungi as food. Let us see whether, as we progress in our argument, we come upon supporting evidence for this possibility. The sacred role of the μύκης as we envisage it, could have been a legacy of the Etruscans or some other Mediterranean culture. In neither ancient nor middle Greek is there any word that scholars translate by &lsquo;morel', so that the way is open for our suggestion. The specific name in Latin was <i>spongia</i> or <i><b class="calibre5">spongiolus</b></i> in imperial times, a survival in Latin of the lost fungal meaning of σπόγγος.</p>

            <p>Just as in French one distinguishes the specific and the generic uses of <i>champignon,</i> so in ancient Greek the reader must decide whether in a given context μύκης meant the morel or the whole fungal tribe. As an example let us take a text from the <i><b class="calibre5">Geoponica,</b></i> an agricultural treatise assembled in its present form before the end of the first millennium A.D. In Book xn Chapter 41 we find a passage that reads thus:</p>

            <p>If you would have μύκητας to grow from the ground, you must select a spot of light soil on a hill where reeds grow; there you must collect together twigs and other burnable things, and set all on fire just before rain is expected. If rain come not, you must sprinkle the place with pure water, but the (μύκητας thus produced are poor ones.</p>

            <p>How reminiscent this is of Gleditsch and Ramsbottom! The Greeks also knew what the German and the Englishman tell us, and in this Greek text μύκης, in our opinion, must carry the specific meaning of &lsquo;morel'.</p>

            <p>Up to this point we have linked fungi only with the gods of thunder and lightning in the Indo-European world. But the association is far more extensive. On a later page we shall see that the Bedouin of the desert, when electric storms are severe in our month of October, know for sure that the crop of esteemed terfezia will be heavy <i>four months later,</i> and at the appointed time they make their way to those places where experience has taught them to seek this delectable fare.</p>

            <p>A Philippine mycologist, Jose Miguel Mendoza, reports [11] that the natives throughout the islands commonly believe that thunder and lightning cause the generation of mushrooms, and in the spring of the year when they hear the thunder roll, they rush into the meadows to gather the edible kinds. In the Pampango tongue, spoken in central Luzon, the collybia albuminosa is called the <i>payungpayungan kulog,</i> the first word meaning &lsquo;parasol-like', and the second being &lsquo;thunder&rsquo; in both Tagalog and Pampango. The culture of the Philippines is an accretion of many layers, and this belief in the thunder-mushroom could be Malayan or Indian or Chinese.</p>

            <p>Yes, Chinese. By good fortune we are able to document the Chinese association of certain mushrooms with thunder. There came into our possession in 1951 a rare, 8-volume work on ethno-mycology entitled <i>The History of Mushrooms,</i> dated 1811 and written by Ishiwara Gusha ('the Fool from the town of Ishiwara'), a pen-name for the Japanese classical scholar Katashi Masujima, professor in Yedo at the school for samurai called Shoheiko. (Another of his pen-names was Ran-en, &lsquo;Orchid Garden'.) In this curious, hand-written work the author gathered together everything that had been said about mushrooms by Chinese and Japanese authors, and it is our hope to present it some day to our readers in an annotated translation. With the help of our friends Mr. and Mrs. Wango Weng, we have discovered in the sixth volume extensive discussions of three kinds of thunder-mushrooms. All three make excellent eating. First there is the <i>lei-ching t'an,</i> &lsquo;thunder-aroused mushroom':</p>

            <figure>
                <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-177_1.jpg" />
            </figure>

            <p>which springs forth when the worms are stirring and the east wind brings the thaw and the earth loosens and the air grows warm. (This suggests the morel, but later the author speaks of the &lsquo;parasol&rsquo; of the mushroom.) The second is the <i>lei-sheng chun,</i> &lsquo;thunder-peal mushroom':</p>

            <figure>
                <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-177_2.jpg" />
            </figure>

            <p>which grows in the grass after thunder and rain in summer and autumn, &lsquo;leaping forth when the thunder calls'. Finally we have the <i>lei chun,</i> the simple &lsquo;thunder-mushroom':</p>

            <p>Though our Japanese author quotes Chinese sources that refer only to the regions of Soochow and Kwangsi Province, this does not mean that the association of thunder with mushrooms is confined to those parts of China. Indeed, we can document the survival of this theme on the very periphery of the Chinese cultural world. In a letter written to us by Charles Evans, the Himalayan explorer and climber, he tells ut that the Sherpas, who culturally are Tibetans, believe that thunderstorms make mushrooms grow. On the other hand Masujima, himself a Japanese, is silent on the thunder theme in his treatment of Japanese mushrooms: apparently the Japanese know it not.</p>

            <p>But this is not all. In the language of the Maori of New Zealand, the word for mushroom is <i>whatitiri</i>. The word for thunder is the same: <i>whatitiri</i> or <i>whaitiri.</i> As a proper noun Whaitiri is the name of the mythical ancestress of the Maori people and all the other branches of the Polynesian race. People think of her as the thunderer, and her grandchild, Tawhaki, shoots forth bolts of lightning from beneath his armpits. Eponym, fire, fungi &mdash; how astonishing that we should find the same pattern in Oceania as in the Mediterranean! Some years ago Professor Heim drew attention to a curious belief in Madagascar, where Polynesian influences have been strong. [12] He is describing the mushroom lentinus tuber regium Fr., called <i>olatafa</i> by the natives of the Tanala country. According to the local chief, the practice is to dry this fungus, and shred and rub it to a powder with the aid of a hard stone, and then to the powder the natives add a little water. When a thunder storm breaks and reaches alarming violence, it is the custom to take some of the paste into the mouth, and when the lightning flashes, spit it forth into the sky, crying out "Fotaka!", or else, " Fotaka malemy!", which means, "Earth!" or "Soft earth!", thereby giving utterance to a prayer that the thunder will be mild as mud. Professor Heim confirmed this practice with other informants in the region of Fort-Carnot. It seems that <i>tafa</i> in the native language designates a person momentarily off balance, and this word may underlie the name of the mushroom and the incantation. Whatever the layers of meaning that underlie the Tanala practice, for us its importance is the tie that binds certain mushrooms with bolts of celestial fire. The explanation given to Professor Heim is not convincing: it sounds like a rationalization by people who have forgotten. That mushroomic spittle tossed into the teeth of the storm, into the flash of lightning &mdash; may it not incorporate the seminal idea, the procreative aspiration, a prayer to the divine begetter &gt; This is not a rhetorical question. It is a suggestion for anthropologists working in Madagascar.</p>

            <p>Here we bring to an end, but only for the present, our discussion of the cultural tie that links mushrooms with lightning. On page 316 we shall return to this mystery, and with the aid of further evidence of our pandemic theme in archaic cultures, we shall submit a surmise to explain it.</p>

His use of the name fomes igniarius was erroneous, as Professor N. Fabritius Buchwald, of the Kgl. Veterinaerog Landbohoejskole, Copenhagen, pointed out in his superseding papers, which in the present state of our knowledge are the latest word on our subject. See his paper on the history and use of the tinder fungus published in 1930 in <i>Meddeleher fra foreningen til svam-</i> <i>pckundskabcns fretnmc,</i> Copenhagen; also his later paper, written with Sigurd Hansen, on post-glacial finds of the tinder fungus, 1934, <i>Dcmmarks geologiske Undersoegelse,</i> IV Rskke, Bd. 2, Nr. n, Copenhagen.

                <li>This double meaning survives in the scientific name for certain microscopic fungi, &lsquo;penicillium&rsquo; (whence the popular &lsquo;penicillin'), which like &lsquo;pencil&rsquo; is derived from a diminutive of 'penis'.</li>
                <li>Pertinent to our argument is a representation of Ixion on an Etruscan vase from Cuma;, reproduced in A. Baumeister's <i>Denkmdlcr des Klassischen Altertums.</i> In this case, in place of the mushroom theme, the figure on the wheel is enclosed in a double aureole of flames.</li>
                <li><p>From the ifith through the i8th century various English writers attributed &lsquo;fairy-rings&rsquo; to lightning; thus Robert Plot's <i>The Natural History of Stafford-shire,</i> 1686, Chap, i; Erasmus Darwin's <i>The Botanic Garden,</i> London, 1791, i: 36:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            So from dark clouds the playful lightning springs,
                            Rives the firm oak, or prints the Fairy-rings.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The evidence indicates that this belief had no roots in folklore but sprang from the New Learning, a &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; explanation to replace outworn notions about the dancing of midnight fairies. Moreover, whereas today &lsquo;fairy-ring&rsquo; immediately suggests mushrooms, the early writers such as Robert Plot discuss fairy-rings at length without mentioning fungi. It was the grass of darker green that made the ring, not mushrooms, and the link between the two is first mentioned, so far as our knowledge goes, in a book published in London in 1717-18, Richard Bradley's <i>New Improvements of Planting and Gardening.</i> Therefore, despite superficial appearances, we think we must rule out the English fairy-ring association with lightning in our discussion of the ancient belief in a thunder- mushroom.</p>
