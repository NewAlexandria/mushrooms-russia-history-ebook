  <p class="calibre1">About the things that man eats he is acutely sensitive. The mere thought of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inviting food starts up his salivary glands, and puts him on tiptoe of eager</p>

  <p class="calibre1">expectation. By contrast, the suggestion that he consume things unclean gives</p>

  <p class="calibre1">him a spasm of revulsion. The attitudes that we have called mycophilia and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophobia hinge on whether fungi are considered delectable food or foul and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">filthy poison. But primitive man had other uses for wild fungi, and he was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">capable of regarding these growths from a detached utilitarian point of view</p>

  <p class="calibre1">without regard to ingestion. We believe this explains the neutral tone of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sponge cluster of words. These words are often bestowed on edible fungi, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they usually yield place to others in the context of food -&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Pilz, grib, champignon.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">If we try to see the fungi as our ancestors saw them, we may divide their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thoughts and feelings about them according to the ends they had in mind:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. INGESTION</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. As poison (a) accidental</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(b) for murder</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. As intoxicant (amanita muscaria), and for divination</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3. As aphrodisiac (including perfume)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">4. As medicine-purgative, styptic, etc. (fomes omcinalis); for contraception</p>

  <p class="calibre1">5. As food.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre5">II. OTHER</b></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. As tinder or touchwood, to catch the spark and start the fire, and to keep a fire in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a smouldering state.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. To produce a stupefying smoke, effective with bees when extracting honey from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the hive, etc.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Modern man, especially the urbanized literate, is almost incapable of imagining</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the importance to his ancestors of fungi for the making of fire. One species</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was especially prized for this purpose - the fomes fomentarius, the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">amadouvier</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">of France, the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Zunderschwamm</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Feuerschivamm</i>&nbsp;of Germany. But many other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kinds served this purpose too, such as 'bunts' or dried puffballs, and the dry,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">friable innards of fungous-infested tree-stumps.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This brings us to a curious trio of English words, 'punk', 'spunk', and 'funk'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We believe all three are members of our sponge cluster, siblings descended</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the Mediterranean&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">fimgus-</i>&nbsp;σπόγγος word family. All three possess one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thing in common: they designate, or at some time in the past have designated,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">112</p>

  <p class="calibre1">PUNK, FIRE, AND LOVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the shelf-fungi that serve as touchwood for making fire. This meaning is not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the oldest recorded use of any of them, but nevertheless as a working hypothesis</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we propose that 'touchwood' be regarded as their primary sense, in which sense</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they circulated in humble discourse for untold centuries, accumulating derived</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and metaphorical meanings as time went on, until finally, when the words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were consigned to paper, it was these secondary and more fashionable meanings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that first achieved the dignity of writing.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Let us take 'spunk', for example. That it belongs to our sponge cluster is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attested by the corresponding Irish word&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sponnc,</i>&nbsp;which means both sponge</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and touchwood. (We find a similar semantic association in Dutch, where</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">zwam</i>&nbsp;means both fungus and tinder; for 'sponge' the Dutch resort to&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">spons.)</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Oxford Dictionary's earliest citation of'spunk', in 1536, the word meant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'spark'; to this day it is still occasionally so used. In 1582 it appears in the sense</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of tinder, and in 1665 as the name of the fungus that makes tinder. Oliver</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Goldsmith toward the end of the i8th century offers us the earliest known use</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of 'spunk' as the moral quality of mettle or pluck. Here in the word 'spunk'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we have a name for touchwood that gathered to itself nobler secondary meanings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">derived from the spark that was the end-product of its use. The word 'spark'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">itself is mysterious: it is known only in the English, Frisian, and Low German</p>

  <p class="calibre1">languages. The question suggests itself whether it is not simply a different phase</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or grade of'spunk' - touchwood in its final act of transfiguration.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Funk' also meant 'spark' in the earliest citations, in the I4th century. We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">first hear of it as fungous touchwood in 1673. Haifa century earlier it was being</p>

  <p class="calibre1">used in the sense of a strong smoke and stench, as from tobacco. This use stems</p>

  <p class="calibre1">back to the shelf-fungi that served to generate a stupefying smoke, to put bees</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to sleep when extracting honey from hives. Before modern sugars became</p>

  <p class="calibre1">common, honey was a commodity of notable importance, both for its sweetness</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and as the base for mead, and in the apiculture of the time, the part played by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungal smoke was important and a commonplace. It was natural that those who</p>

  <p class="calibre1">disapproved of tobacco in the early days should have first associated this smok-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing plant with the familiar smoke-generating fungus. The depressing moral</p>

  <p class="calibre1">connotations of 'funk' first appear in the i8th century: he who languishes in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a funk is in a moral stupor, overcome in a smoke-cloud.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Most interesting of the three words is 'punk', which in the sense of touchwood</p>

  <p class="calibre1">first appears about 1707. As with the other two words, the lexicographers say</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the origin of 'punk' is obscure, but they give reserved recognition to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">theory that it was borrowed in colonial times from an Algonquin word, pho-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">netically similar, meaning dust or ashes. 'Punk' is the ordinary English word for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">113</p>

  <p class="calibre1">touchwood today, and it is <i class="calibre4">prima facie</i> incredible that an Algonquin term for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so ancient and domestic a commodity should have swept the English-speaking</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world and won general acceptance late in cultural history. We think there is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">circumstantial evidence to show that the word was securely established in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English in Elizabethan times, and this leads us directly into the strange erotic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">associations of our punk-spunk-funk triplets.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the i6th century 'punk' meant a strumpet, as it still does, and what is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strumpet but the tinder that whips into flame the gay young spark allured by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">her favors? Let no one dismiss this figure as fanciful. For 'touchwood' the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French say <i class="calibre4">amadou,</i> which is simply the Proven9al word for 'lover'. Lovers,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like tinder, are quick to take fire. The French verb <i class="calibre4">amadouer</i> means to coax,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">just as we 'coax' a fire with tinder. In modern English slang 'punk' is a con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">temptuous adjective for things of low quality - a natural semantic extension</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the brothel word. The erotic association of 'punk' is feminine. That of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'spunk' is primarily masculine: in certain English circles and at certain levels</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of conversation, it is the accepted word for the seminal fluid of the human</p>

  <p class="calibre1">male. 'Sparking' a girl used to mean 'courting' in American slang, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Dictionary of American English</i> also records the far stronger 'spunking'. We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have seen how the nasal infix of the words of our sponge cluster comes and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">goes, associating this large verbal family with the <i class="calibre4">pogge</i> constellation. If we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drop from 'funk' its nasal infix, we are in the presence of the supreme erotic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word of the English language. The Russian word for touchwood is <i class="calibre4">trut</i> (rim-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing with 'brute'), and it is directly derived from the Russian word for 'rub'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though <i class="calibre4">trut</i> itself carries no erotic meaning, it is the key to certain ancient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Russian riddles where the erotic sense lies hidden. The generating of fire by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the friction of wooden surfaces - a technique in which one wood must be soft</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the other hard - may explain why, among the many forms that 'mushroom'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has taken in English, we find 'mushrub'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And now the thread of our argument leads us from philological clues over</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the threshold into anthropology, where we begin to discover the deep erotic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">symbolism of the mushroom world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Throughout most of human history and down into our own times, men have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">usually made fire by either of two methods - by percussion, striking flint</p>

  <p class="calibre1">against pyrites or (in later times) against iron to generate sparks that will ignite</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tinder, or by the friction of wood on wood through the aid of a simple device</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for which the English anthropologist Edward B. Tylor devised the name 'fire-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drill' in the last century. The usual fire-drill consists of two wooden members,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a flat smooth piece of soft wood held horizontal, and a round stick of harder</p>

  <p class="calibre1">114</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/index-162_2.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">PLATE xxi. Etruscan Mirror. Ixion on his wheel. <i class="calibre4">London, British Museum.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">PUNK, FIRE, AND LOVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wood. The stick is pivoted perpendicularly in a notch on the horizontal face</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the soft wood, and then rapidly rotated, sometimes between the hands but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">more often with the aid of an ingeniously disposed thong or strap or bow-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">string. A pulsating pressure is applied to the rotating stick, as it rotates first</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clockwise and then counter-clockwise. The stick by friction widens and deepens</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the hole in the soft wood, and fine wood-dust gathering in the hole becomes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">red hot, until when tinder is applied to it, by blowing the tinder catches fire.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For us the interesting thing is that among the peoples who use the fire-drill,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the horizontal piece of soft wood is called the 'female' and is sometimes even</p>

  <p class="calibre1">carved crudely to suggest a human figure, and the stick is called the 'male'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The engendering of the fire is regarded as a sexual act, and is pregnant with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">emotional significance and hallowed by mythological overtones.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Over the past century there have been published a number of papers by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">anthropologists on the methods used by our ancestors and other early peoples</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for kindling fire.1 The percussion method can be traced to remote times, thanks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the survival of the artifacts employed - the flints and the irons, and the masses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of decomposing pyrites used before the iron age. By contrast, the perishable fire-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">drill - the wooden members that by friction yield fire - must generally be studied</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among our primitive contemporaries, although Egyptian records establish its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use in ancient Egypt. These two primitive methods for making fire, percussion</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and friction, survive to this day by lineal descent in our 'lighters' (the French</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">briquets]</i> and matches.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our own interest lies in tinder, that humble but indispensable condiment in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the generation of fire, the highly inflammable material, otherwise worthless,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that is the nexus between the spark on the one hand and the kindling on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other. The kinds of tinder that have been used in various parts of the world are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">many: charred rags, lint, down, the flower stalk of the agave, dried moss, dried</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bark, and fungi. Many kinds of fungi have served this purpose, including</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ordinary mushrooms in a dried state, puffballs, and, according to the classical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lexicons, the fomes officinalis - the <i class="calibre4">agaricum</i> or 'female agaricke' of the old</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pharmacopoeias. (While this medicinal shelf fungus could certainly have served</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the spark-catching function, we have found no classical text supporting the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lexicons, and its value as medicine would seem to have made the humbler service</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unlikely, especially as it had to be imported from beyond the Bosphorus.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Down to our own times the writers about tinder have almost always been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">confusing in their use of fungal names: they have seldom been competent in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. For a recapitulation of the subject and further references, see Arthur Bernard Cook's <i class="calibre4">Zeus God of the Bright</i></p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_50">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">technicalities of the industry that served the market with commercial tinder.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We believe, however, that there is agreement among competent students:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in medieval and renaissance times, and indeed into our own era, the best com-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mercial tinder of Northern Europe was always made from the shelf-fungus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known to mycologists as the fomes fornentarius, a species that must not be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">confused with the mis-named fomes igniarius. Indeed, today we know that this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">use of the fomes fomentarius for tinder goes back far. It has been found in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">human settlements at Maglemose, on the island of Seeland in Denmark, in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">conjunction with flint and the remains of pyrites.1 It has been found repeatedly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Danish peat bogs of the same era. The Maglemose finds go back to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">oldest stone age in Denmark, c. 6,000 B.C. The final ice age had drawn to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">close c. 12,000 B.C., and after an interval of tundra ecology, a forest growth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">succeeded, including the birch trees with which invariably the early specimens</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of fomes fomentarius have been associated. The making of tinder from this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">particular fungus may well be the oldest surviving industry with a continuous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">history in northern Europe. We suggest as an hypothesis that this fungus was the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">object to which the name <i class="calibre4">Schwamm</i> or 'punk' in earlier forms was originally</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bestowed. These words dealt with the fungal world from a utilitarian point</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of view, not gustatory; with inedible shelf fungi, not mushrooms. This would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">account for the emotional neutrality of the sponge cluster of words, as contrasted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the pronounced values, negative or positive, of 'toadstool', <i class="calibre4">'champignon',</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">and many others. Or rather, to speak with more precision, this would account</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the two distinct emotional responses evoked by mushroomic words. Where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ingestion is concerned, the response, whether favorable or unfavorable, is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sharp and keyed to the gustatory sense. Where fire-making is concerned, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">archaic emotion that lingers on in such words as 'punk' and 'spunk' is an erotic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">transfer.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In ancient Greece the god of fire-making was Ixion. He hailed from Mount</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pelion, a center of Helladic culture, where he fathered the Lapiths, the Satyrs,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the Centaurs, tribes that were kin to the Etruscans and that enjoyed singular</p>

  <p class="calibre1">repute for sexual potency. According to the myth, Ixion was bound to a great</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. The fomes fomentarius found at Maglemose was described by the Danish scholar, Dr. G. F. L. Sarauw:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Le feu et son emploi dans le Nord de 1'Europe, aux temps prehistoriques et protohistoriques", in the <i class="calibre4">Annales du</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">XX Congres archeologique et <b class="calibre5">historique</b> de Belgique,</i> i., pp. 196-226. His use of the name fomes igniarius was erro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">neous, as Professor N. Fabritius Buchwald, of the Kgl. Veterinaer- og Landbohoejskole, Copenhagen, pointed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out in his superseding papers, which in the present state of our knowledge are the latest word on our subject.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">See his paper on the history and use of the tinder fungus published in 1930 in <i class="calibre4">Meddeleher fra foreningen til svam-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pckundskabcns fretnmc,</i> Copenhagen; also his later paper, written with Sigurd Hansen, on post-glacial finds of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">title of this paper is, 'Om Fund af Toendersvamp (Polyporus fomentarius [L.] Fr.) fra Postglacialtiden i Danmark'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">PUNK, FIRE, AND LOVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wheel (the sun-wheel) and sent spinning for eternity into space because he had</p>

  <p class="calibre1">permitted himself to become enamored of Hera. Before this sentence was meted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out, unbeknownst to him his guilt was proven by trickery: a cloud was made to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">condense into the figure of Hera, and Ixion did not resist temptation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the British Museum there is an Etruscan mirror, variously attributed to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the 3rd, 4th, or 5th centuries B.C., on which Ixion is depicted undergoing his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">punishment. Nude, bound to a seven-spoked wheel, he is in the running posture</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that denotes speed. Between the spokes of the wheel we discover two designs,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of which one is almost entirely lost. The scholar A. B. Cook, describing this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mirror in his work on Zeus, dismissed these signs as meaningless. But it will</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be observed that the two designs are not components of the ornamental border.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They are functional elements in the iconographic message. They possess a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning, but what meaning? Robert Graves, who drew them to our attention,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggests that they are mushrooms. He is surely right, and if so, this Etruscan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mirror offers us the earliest known representations of fungi in European art;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and we observe that the role they here play is related not to food or poison</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but to the generation of fire. The eroticism of the design tells us a story inti-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mately linked with the Ixion myth. On one level we see a capped mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">representing no particular species. On another level we observe that the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room consists of two members, symbolizing the male and female organs of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fire-drill, and they are engaged in the supreme act of fire generation. Earlier</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we have suggested that certain basic words for the fungi are keyed to words for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the womb. We now remind our readers that the Greek word for mushroom,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">P.UXYJ?, also means the <i class="calibre4">membmm virile.1</i> There are the same bi-sexual correspon-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dences in the mushroom vocabulary that anthropologists discover in the names</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the two parts of the fire-drill. The pattern that we discover on the Etruscan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mirror is, we think, a pictograph symbolizing the generation of fire, the function</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Ixion. This interpretation is in harmony with the verbal and semantic ties</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that, by independent evidence, we have discovered in Europe's mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vocabulary. The artist of the Etruscan mirror offers us three messages in one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">design - a fire-drill in the act of generating fire, a sexual performance, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom with stipe stabbing the pileus (i.e., μύκης and vulva) that is the symbol</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the other two.2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The medicinal shelf fungus known today as the fomes officinalis used to be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. This double meaning survives in the scientific name for certain microscopic fungi, 'penicillium' (whence the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">popular 'penicillin'), which like 'pencil' is derived from a diminutive of'penis'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">2.</i> Pertinent to our argument is a representation of Ixion on an Etruscan vase from Cuma;, reproduced in A.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Baumeister's <i class="calibre4">Denkmdlcr des Klassischen Altertums.</i> In this case, in place of the mushroom theme, the figure on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">called in English the 'female agaricke'. This sexual attribution in one form</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or another goes back to Dioscorides and Pliny. The explanation that they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">offer for it seems a little forced. According to them, the female agaric possessed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">straight veins resembling the teeth of a comb, and was white and light through-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out, at first sweet to the taste and then bitter - an observation that suggests</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a cynical view of womankind. This was the only kind recommended for me-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dicinal use, and the description fits the fomes officinahs. The 'male agaricke',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which seems to have been a term applicable to the fomes fomentarius and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fomes igniarius, was brown or reddish, sticky, long, hard, and heavy. These</p>

  <p class="calibre1">descriptions, more suggestive erotically than enlightening mycologically, ori-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ginated in the ancient authorities, but were repeated tirelessly until we find</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them in such English pharmacopoeias as William Salmon's <i class="calibre4">Pharmacopoeia Londi-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">nensis, or the New London Dispensatory,</i> London, 1682, and <i class="calibre4">A Treatise on Foreign</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Vegetables,</i> by Ralph Thicknesse, M.D., London, 1749.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We can adduce startling evidence proving the hold on the Greek imagination</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the sexual associations of shelf fungi. In a loth century Byzantine codex</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Dioscorides now owned by The Pierpont Morgan Library, the section on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the άγαρικόν is illustrated by the miniaturist, but his design bears no resemblance</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the fomes officinahs! He must have been totally ignorant of it. Drawing his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">knowledge solely from the text with its account of the male and female kinds,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he has given us two drawings inspired by the male and female genital organs!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our loth century miniaturist may have been copying an earlier manuscript,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but we know not how far back this aberration goes. Some five centuries later,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the year 1491, in the earliest printed book carrying fungal illustrations, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">artist was clear and accurate in his delineation of the <i class="calibre4">agaricum</i> (Fig. 7).</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Fungi and fire - the tie that weds these two disparate elements was indeed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">old, strong, and far-reaching. Consider the following additional evidence. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ancient Greece there was a mushroom that bore the name κεραύνιον. This word,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like <i class="calibre4">joudre</i> in French, conveys the idea of both thunder and lightning, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom designated by it was therefore the 'thunderbolt-fungus'. We do</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not know exactly what species it was, but in Latin it was rendered contempo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">raneously by <i class="calibre4">tuber,</i> and therefore it was probably an underground growth, per-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">haps a truffle or a species of terfezia. Many ancient writers refer to the common</p>

  <p class="calibre1">belief that thunderbolts made this fungus grow plentifully. Galen speaks of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it. Plutarch in his <i class="calibre4">Convivial Essays</i> devotes a table conversation to the question</p>

  <p class="calibre1">why thunder should engender 'thunderbolt' fungi, an essay both graceful and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unenlightening. Pliny the Elder in his <i class="calibre4">Historia Naturalis,</i> in Book xix, is careful</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Concerning these a singular fact is related, viz., that they grow when autumn rains</p>

  <p class="calibre1">come with severe thunderstorms; the more thundering there is, the more they grow, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">presumption being that this is the more important cause. [BOOK n: 62]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One could not demand better documentation for this ancient notion which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the most intelligent men of the day accepted without question. What explana-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion is there for it; Plutarch had none. Modern mycologists have none. Does</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thunder perhaps shake the soil and precipitate a crop of fungi that would other-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wise emerge over weeks? There is no evidence to support this. We believe that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the classical writers were repeating words whose portentous religious meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was already in their time forgotten.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The ancient belief must have survived the classic world, but we have found</p>

  <p class="calibre1">only one sure evidence of it in modern Europe. In Littre under <i class="calibre4">tniffe</i> we read</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the statement that when it thunders, people in some parts of the French coun-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tryside say, "Voila un bon temps pour les truftes" — "There's fine weather for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">truffles."1 Professor Georg Morgenstierne of Oslo, however, has turned up for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us amazing data proving that the link between fire and fungi lingers on to this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">day in certain parts of Asia. (To Professor Morgenstierne we are deeply indebted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for all our information concerning the Iranian and Indie languages.) In Kashmir</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the gilled mushrooms known as <i class="calibre4">hedur</i> and <i class="calibre4">henda</i> are said to be engendered</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by thunder. They are eaten by both Hindus and Muslims, cooked with ghee;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they are preserved by drying and used in broths and stews. The mountains of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Kashmir produce great quantities of another mushroom, <i class="calibre4">kana-g"ch,</i> which means</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'ear-morel', and it too emerges from the earth in response to thunder.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">More remarkable still is the testimony from that valley southeast of Samarkand</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where Yaghnobi is spoken, a dialect descended from the ancient Sogdian lan-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">guage, related to Persian and of course belonging to the Indo-European family.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The folk who speak this tongue believe that when the highest god shakes his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">winter coat, the air is rent with thunder, and then the children must say:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. From the ifith through the i8th century various English writers attributed 'fairy-rings' to lightning; thus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Robert Plot's <i class="calibre4">The Natural History of Stafford-shire,</i> 1686, Chap, i; Erasmus Darwin's <i class="calibre4">The Botanic Garden,</i> London,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1791, i: 36:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">So from dark clouds the playful lightning springs,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Rives the firm oak, or prints the Fairy-rings.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The evidence indicates that this belief had no roots in folklore but sprang from the New Learning, a 'scientific'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">explanation to replace outworn notions about the dancing of midnight fairies. Moreover, whereas today 'fairy-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ring' immediately suggests mushrooms, the early writers such as Robert Plot discuss fairy-rings at length without</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mentioning fungi. It was the grass of darker green that made the ring, not mushrooms, and the link between</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the two is first mentioned, so far as our knowledge goes, in a book published in London in 1717-18, Richard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bradley's <i class="calibre4">New Improvements of Planting and Gardening.</i> Therefore, despite superficial appearances, we think we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">must rule out the English fairy-ring association with lightning in our discussion of the ancient belief in a thunder-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">PUNK, FIRE, AND LOVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Katta xarcak man, pullja xarcak tau.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The big mushroom is for me, the small one for you.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Not far away, in the upper Zarafshan valley where we find a Persian dialect</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known as Tadzhik, the children cry, "Puri, puri, xorc", xorc'meaning 'mushroom'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and <i class="calibre4">puri</i> being a thick-stalked annual that springs up early in the season and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quickly dies away, both stalk and root being eaten raw by the natives. Someone</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should tell us which mushroom these children near the Pamirs have in mind. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yaghnobi, and also in Tadzhik as spoken in the vicinity of the town of Match,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there survives an old belief that when the divinity known as <i class="calibre4">Mama,</i> 'Grand-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mother', shakes her baggy trousers, she lets fly a swarm of lice to the earth, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from those lice, after thunder storms, an abundance of mushrooms spring up.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Today in Persia the common word for 'mushroom' is <i class="calibre4">qarc,</i> but there is one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kind, perhaps a terfezia, that is called <i class="calibre4">dumbalan</i> (plural of <i class="calibre4">dumbal,</i> 'boil', 'pustule',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'bubo'), and people say they grow in the desert 'after thunderstorms'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Again thanks to Professor Morgenstierne, we are able to pin-point the earliest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reference in surviving Sanskrit literature to this belief in the 'thunder-mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room'. It is in Kalidasa's lyrical poem <i class="calibre4">Meghaduta,</i> 'The Cloud Messenger', writ-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ten about A.D. 400. In verse n the exiled <i class="calibre4">yaksha</i> or demigod addresses the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rain-cloud drifting northward over India:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">. . . and when they hear thy sweet-sounding, fertilizing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thunder, which is able to cover the earth with mushrooms. . .</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The word used for 'mushroom' here is <i class="calibre4">s'ilmdhra,</i> of unknown derivation, pro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bably taken over by Sanskrit from some earlier unrelated tongue of India.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">'Sili'</i> might mean a frog or toad, and then <i class="calibre4">-dhra</i> would mean 'carrying': 'toad-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">carrier' or something akin to our 'toadstool'. But this tempting explanation of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the ancient word is far from established.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Is it not deeply stirring to contemplate these surviving traces of a folk asso-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ciation uniting thunderbolts with fungi - a belief accepted by ancient Greece and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Rome, queried by Plutarch, and holding on in Kashmir and the Pamirs?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Angelo de Gubernatis in the second volume of his <i class="calibre4">Mythologie des Plantes</i> (Paris,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1882), when he discusses mushrooms, observes that the solar hero was said</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sometimes in antiquity to hide behind a mushroom, and he supposes that by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'mushroom' a cloud was meant. The direct and simple meaning seems prefer-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">able. The solar hero, a projection of divine fire, lies dormant for the nonce in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. See Heinrich F. J. Junker, <i class="calibre4">Arische Forschungcn,</i> 'Yaghnobi-Studien', I, p. 106 <i class="calibre4">(Abhandlungen d. philol.-hist.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungal tinder, ready to leap forth on divine command, just as the dormant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">φαλλός; rises in ίθύ-φαλλος. Here then is a partial answer to Plutarch's question: the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungi, saturated in sexual associations, are intimately associated as tinder with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the making of fire, and fire expresses metaphorically the procreative act. On</p>

  <p class="calibre1">every plane the fungal world is redolent with the spirit of generation. Even the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phosphorescence that some fungi emit must have deepened the mystery,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">augmented the awe. The very fungi were called into being by the gods, by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">those bolts of celestial fire hurled to earth with the crackling and deafening roar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of thunder.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Let us pursue this theme further, to the very core of ancient Rome's religious</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beliefs. Rome's eponymous heroes sprang from the union of divine fire with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vestal virgins, and fungi seem to have been officially present at the consum-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mation. Sir James Frazer in <i class="calibre4">The Golden Bough</i> summarized the legends and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pointed out their meaning.1 It seems that when Ocrisia, handmaiden to Tanaquil</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the wife of King Tarquin the Elder, was offering cakes and libations of wine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the royal hearth, a flame assumed the shape of the male member and shot</p>

  <p class="calibre1">forth from the fire, impregnating her with a child who was destined to reign</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as Servius Tullius. The child's divine paternity was well attested later when an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">aureole of lambent flame was seen to play around his head. Concerning Romulus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Remus Plutarch records a similar legend, which he took from Promathion's</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">History of Rome:</i> in the house of the king of Alba there hovered over the hearth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for days a phantasma in the shape of the male organ of generation, which in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the end, by one of the handmaidens, gave being to the twins.2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nowhere in surviving versions of these legends are fungi mentioned. What</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then was our surprise when we discovered that Professor Arthur Stanley Pease</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Harvard University, in a note in <i class="calibre4">Classical Philology</i> in 1947, urged that a natural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phenomenon be sought to explain these miracles and volunteered the surmise that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the key would be found in the mushroom that he called the ithyphallus impudi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cus, that astonishing fungus which from its sac or cod shoots forth to its proud</p>

  <p class="calibre1">height in the course of minutes. This, says Professor Pease, is what underlay</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ovid's line in the <i class="calibre4">Fasti,</i> vi: 631:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">.. . hie inter cineris obsceni forma virilis.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the sources; a fuller discussion appears in Frazer's translation and discussion of Ovid's <i class="calibre4">Fasti,</i> published by Mac-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1 2 2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">PUNK, FIRE, AND LOVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Professor Pease's happy suggestion may be refined. The morel, though far re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">moved in mycological classification from the phallus impudicus, embodies in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its shape the same erotic symbol, and unlike the phalloidacese shows a remark-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">able predilection for sites of wood fires. J. G. Gleditsch in his <i class="calibre4">Methodus Fungo-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">rum,</i> published in Berlin in 1753, told1 how just recently the old peasant women</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Brandenburg, observing this predilection, had taken to making bonfires</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the woods to induce the growth of morels, causing thereby so many forest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fires that the authorities had banned the practice. Dr. Ramsbottom in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Mushrooms &amp; Toadstools</i> reports that during and after the first World War the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sites of burned houses in northern France and of abandoned trenches became</p>

  <p class="calibre1">veritable gardens of morels, and he also relates a personal experience confirm-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing this biological nexus between morels and fired places. Indeed this affinity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is a commonplace of fungal lore.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We place then a morel rather than the stinkhorn in those ancient hearths of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Rome's eponymous founders. And this leads us to venture a daring conjecture</p>

  <p class="calibre1">concerning the origin of the Greek work for 'mushroom', μύκης. In modern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times we are in a position to observe how the words of the sponge cluster - the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">basic words for the fungi in common Indo-European - yield place sometimes to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other words that express a fashionable facet of man's evolving attitude toward the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungal world. From a name for a single edible species, <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> in 'mushroom'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">becomes a designation for any edible species and even for all species. The French</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">champignon,</i> once applied only to the common field mushroom, acquired over-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shadowing importance when the art of its cultivation was mastered, and now</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this word embraces in French all fungi, even the microscopic kinds. In German</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Pilz</i> is a newcomer, but already competes with <i class="calibre4">Schwamm,</i> and in Russian <i class="calibre4">guba</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">has largely surrendered the field to the toothsome <i class="calibre4">grib.</i> Thanks to the importance</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a particular mushroom species, its specific name can become generic. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greek σπόγγος lost its fungal meaning early - the surviving records never report it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">- and its terrain was wholly occupied by μύκης. What potent forces could have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">caused this early substitution? Our surmise is that μύκης originally was the name of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the morel, and that its awesome religious and magical meaning, its link with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the generation of fire and divine procreation, so far eclipsed all other fungal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">associations that it took over the whole semantic area of the fungi. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greeks never won honors in mycophagy and there was no competition from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungi as food. Let us see whether, as we progress in our argument, we come</p>

  <p class="calibre1">upon supporting evidence for this possibility. The sacred role of the μύκης as we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">envisage it, could have been a legacy of the Etruscans or some other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mediterranean culture. In neither ancient nor middle Greek is there any word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that scholars translate by 'morel', so that the way is open for our suggestion.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The specific name in Latin was <i class="calibre4">spongia</i> or <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">spongiolus</b></i> in imperial times, a survival</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Latin of the lost fungal meaning of σπόγγος.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Just as in French one distinguishes the specific and the generic uses of <i class="calibre4">cham-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pignon,</i> so in ancient Greek the reader must decide whether in a given context</p>

  <p class="calibre1">μύκης meant the morel or the whole fungal tribe. As an example let us take a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">text from the <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">Geoponica,</b></i> an agricultural treatise assembled in its present form</p>

  <p class="calibre1">before the end of the first millennium A.D. In Book xn Chapter 41 we find a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">passage that reads thus:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If you would have μύκητας to grow from the ground, you must select a spot of light soil</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on a hill where reeds grow ; there you must collect together twigs and other burnable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">things, and set all on fire just before rain is expected. If rain come not, you must sprinkle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the place with pure water, but the (μύκητας thus produced are poor ones.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How reminiscent this is of Gleditsch and Ramsbottom! The Greeks also knew</p>

  <p class="calibre1">what the German and the Englishman tell us, and in this Greek text μύκης, in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our opinion, must carry the specific meaning of 'morel'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Up to this point we have linked fungi only with the gods of thunder and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lightning in the Indo-European world. But the association is far more extensive.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On a later page we shall see that the Bedouin of the desert, when electric storms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are severe in our month of October, know for sure that the crop of esteemed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terfezia will be heavy <i class="calibre4">four months later,</i> and at the appointed time they make their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">way to those places where experience has taught them to seek this delectable fare.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A Philippine mycologist, Jose Miguel Mendoza, reports1 that the natives</p>

  <p class="calibre1">throughout the islands commonly believe that thunder and lightning cause the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">generation of mushrooms, and in the spring of the year when they hear the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thunder roll, they rush into the meadows to gather the edible kinds. In the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pampango tongue, spoken in central Luzon, the collybia albuminosa is called the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">payungpayungan kulog,</i> the first word meaning 'parasol-like', and the second</p>

  <p class="calibre1">being 'thunder' in both Tagalog and Pampango. The culture of the Philippines</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is an accretion of many layers, and this belief in the thunder-mushroom could</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be Malayan or Indian or Chinese.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yes, Chinese. By good fortune we are able to document the Chinese association</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of certain mushrooms with thunder. There came into our possession in 1951 a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dated 1811 and written by Ishiwara Gusha ('the Fool from the town of Ishiwara'),</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a pen-name for the Japanese classical scholar Katashi Masujima, professor in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yedo at the school for samurai called Shoheiko. (Another of his pen-names</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was Ran-en, 'Orchid Garden'.) In this curious, hand-written work the author</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gathered together everything that had been said about mushrooms by Chinese</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Japanese authors, and it is our hope to present it some day to our readers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in an annotated translation. With the help of our friends Mr. and Mrs. Wango</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Weng, we have discovered in the sixth volume extensive discussions of three</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kinds of thunder-mushrooms. All three make excellent eating. First there is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4">lei-ching t'an,</i> 'thunder-aroused mushroom':</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">which springs forth when the worms are stirring and the east wind brings the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thaw and the earth loosens and the air grows warm. (This suggests the morel,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but later the author speaks of the 'parasol' of the mushroom.) The second is the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">lei-sheng chun,</i> 'thunder-peal mushroom':</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which grows in the grass after thunder and rain in summer and autumn, 'leaping</p>

  <p class="calibre1">forth when the thunder calls'. Finally we have the <i class="calibre4">lei chun,</i> the simple 'thunder-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom' :</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Though our Japanese author quotes Chinese sources that refer only to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">regions of Soochow and Kwangsi Province, this does not mean that the asso-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ciation of thunder with mushrooms is confined to those parts of China. Indeed,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we can document the survival of this theme on the very periphery of the Chi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nese cultural world. In a letter written to us by Charles Evans, the Himalayan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">explorer and climber, he tells ut that the Sherpas, who culturally are Tibetans,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">believe that thunderstorms make mushrooms grow. On the other hand Ma-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sujima, himself a Japanese, is silent on the thunder theme in his treatment of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Japanese mushrooms: apparently the Japanese know it not.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But this is not all. In the language of the Maori of New Zealand, the word for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom is <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">whatitiri.</b></i> The word for thunder is the same: <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">whatitiri</b></i> or <i class="calibre4">whaitiri.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">As a proper noun Whaitiri is the name of the mythical ancestress of the Maori</p>

  <p class="calibre1">people and all the other branches of the Polynesian race. People think of her as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the thunderer, and her grandchild, Tawhaki, shoots forth bolts of lightning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from beneath his armpits. Eponym, fire, fungi - how astonishing that we should</p>

  <p class="calibre1">find the same pattern in Oceania as in the Mediterranean! Some years ago</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Professor Heim drew attention to a curious belief in Madagascar, where Poly-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nesian influences have been strong.1 He is describing the mushroom lentinus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tuber regium Fr., called <i class="calibre4">olatafa</i> by the natives of the Tanala country. According</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the local chief, the practice is to dry this fungus, and shred and rub it to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a powder with the aid of a hard stone, and then to the powder the natives</p>

  <p class="calibre1">add a little water. When a thunder storm breaks and reaches alarming violence,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it is the custom to take some of the paste into the mouth, and when the lightning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">flashes, spit it forth into the sky, crying out "Fotaka!", or else, " Fotaka malemy!",</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which means, "Earth!" or "Soft earth!", thereby giving utterance to a prayer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the thunder will be mild as mud. Professor Heim confirmed this practice</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with other informants in the region of Fort-Carnot. It seems that <i class="calibre4">tafa</i> in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">native language designates a person momentarily off balance, and this word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">may underlie the name of the mushroom and the incantation. Whatever the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">layers of meaning that underlie the Tanala practice, for us its importance is the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tie that binds certain mushrooms with bolts of celestial fire. The explanation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">given to Professor Heim is not convincing: it sounds like a rationalization by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">people who have forgotten. That mushroomic spittle tossed into the teeth of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the storm, into the flash of lightning - may it not incorporate the seminal idea,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the procreative aspiration, a prayer to the divine begetter &gt; This is not a rhetorical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">question. It is a suggestion for anthropologists working in Madagascar.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here we bring to an end, but only for the present, our discussion of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cultural tie that links mushrooms with lightning. On page 316 we shall return</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to this mystery, and with the aid of further evidence of our pandemic theme</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in archaic cultures, we shall submit a surmise to explain it.</p>
