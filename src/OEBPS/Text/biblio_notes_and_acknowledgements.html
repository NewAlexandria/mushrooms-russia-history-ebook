  <h1>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h1>

  <p class="calibre1">THE amateur of wild mushrooms is interested in everything written on&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">the subject. Few scientific papers are too refined for his palate. The strange</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">blunders often cropping out in popular writings delight him for their piquancy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In cut-and-dried mushroom manuals he always knows that at any moment he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">may come across wayward remarks of the compilers that show how even they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are moved by the beauty or strangeness of the creatures they describe. An extra-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ordinary example of this eruption of the poetic muse in the course of a pedes-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">trian text about mushrooms is to be found in a certain Swiss manual published</p>

  <p class="calibre1">more than sixty years ago: it is so unusual that we offer it in full to our readers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Appendix III.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In general the mushroom amateur, when it comes to his library, must be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">content with fare served for others - texts written for beginners or treatises for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scientists. The writings about mushrooms aimed at the informed amateur are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">few. As he embarks on the assembling of a collection, he will do well to begin</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by acquiring a complete set of the publications since 1936 of the Laboratoire</p>

  <p class="calibre1">de Cryptogamie, at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. This is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the period of Professor Roger Heim's editorship of the <i class="calibre4">Revue de Mycologie.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Professor Heim is a leading mycologist. What is more rare, he is a scientist</p>

  <p class="calibre1">steeped in the humanities who writes with style. He has the magnetism of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">great teachers, and has drawn into the circle of subscribers to his <i class="calibre4">Revue</i> a group</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of enthusiasts who contribute delightful and sophisticated articles to various <i class="calibre4">Sup-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">plements</i> of the review, which are expressly directed to initiated amateurs. Two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">outstanding members of this select fraternity are Georges Becker and Camille</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Fauvel, whose essays on wild mushrooms, poles apart in style and mood, are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">destined to be regarded as classics by the devotees of our avocation. The <i class="calibre4">Revue</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">de Mycologie</i> offers its readers a <i class="calibre4">Chronique de I'amateur, La Chronique anecdotique,</i> a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">practical course in mycology for amateurs, excellent color plates of mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scientific supplements shedding light on the fascinating jungle of tropical mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room life, and finally occasional treatises on special topics. Who will ever match</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that Savoyard, the prodigious Dr. Paul Ramain, for example, who in his <i class="calibre4">Essai</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">de Mycogastronomie</i> sets forth with delicate discrimination the merits (or short-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">comings) for gastronomes of each of 245 species of edible mushrooms, all from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his personal experience! He sets forth the astonishing facts about what we might</p>

  <p class="calibre1">call the 'vintage years' for mushrooms: it is clear that mushrooms taste better</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in some years than others, and in some regions than others. No mushroom fan-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cier should rest content so long as he is unfamiliar with the breathtaking perfor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mance of Dr. Ramain.1 The presiding genius in this circle of mycophiles is of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">course the Maitre, Professor Heim, whose own contributions are always notable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">events. Especially among English readers, nature writing enjoys high status as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a genre of belles lettres. Roger Heim is to be ranked with the aristocrats of this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">goodly company. His paper delivered in February 1946 on 'Les Rapports entre</p>

  <p class="calibre1">les Insectes et les Champignons' displayed a dual excellence, scientific and literary,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the highest order, all the more moving for the informed few who know that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this essay, for all its air of serene detachment, was read in the wake of a terrible</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ordeal. Two years later Professor Heim published a book, <i class="calibre4">Les Champignons,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">original in conception, of rare quality, which is a treasure for connoisseurs of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nature writing and for all lovers of mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Outside of the Heim circle there are other mushroomic publications for ama-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">teurs, but few in number and uneven in quality. One of the good books, in its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">way, is Jules Amann's <i class="calibre4">Mes Chasses aux Champignons,</i> published in Lausanne in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1925. In English there is <i class="calibre4">The Romance of the Fungus World,</i> by R. T. and F. W.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Rolfe, published in London in 1925, written without literary distinction but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">containing an immense amount of information never theretofore assembled.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We gladly acknowledge our debt to the Rolfes for various data and historical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">references; as we do also to John Ramsbottom, best known of contemporary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English mycologists, for the wealth of information in his <i class="calibre4">Mushrooms &amp; Toad-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">stools,</i> London, 1953, which reached us just in time for us to make some use of it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In America the amateur of mushrooms is hobbled by the lack of a first-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">class field manual, comparable in the mycological field to Roger Tory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Peterson's manual for the birds. America's library of nature books is rich in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quality and quantity, but a good mushroom manual is a prime desideratum.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This deficiency is itself evidence of the wide-spread mycophobia in Ame-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rica, and serves to perpetuate it. There are excellent works by American</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycologists that cover various parts of the vast terrain, but no all-embracing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pocket guide in a class with <i class="calibre4">Les Champignons de France,</i> by A. Maublanc, or</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">A Handbook of the Larger British Fungi,</i> by John Ramsbottom, in England. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the absence of a manual for America, these two European works, which are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">complementary rather than overlapping, are in our opinion the most serviceable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the United States and Canada, in spite of the differences in the fungal popu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lation of the two continents.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The compilation of our book has proved an easier and pleasanter task than</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. In the spring of 1954 there appeared Paul Ramain's <i class="calibre4">Mycogastronomie,</i> published in Paris in a limited edition</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by Les Bibliophiles Gastronomes. Here we find scores of princely recipes for different species of mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">including even two desserts: Salades d'Oronges a 1'Orange and Pezizes Orangees Ali-Bab.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the reader might suppose. Our secret lay in formulating the right questions, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then submitting them to the right specialists, in whom knowledge and gracious-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ness were equally blended. Such learning as we may have appeared to possess</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Chapters IV and V is thus no more than a synthesis of other people's; but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the responsibility for the synthesis, for better or for worse, must rest with us.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In our preface and in the course of our pages we have already recognized our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">obligations to many. We now give ourselves the pleasure of acknowledging</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our debts to some of the others.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We are grateful to Professor Georg Morgenstierne of Oslo not only for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rich budget of data concerning the Iranian and Indie peoples that he sent us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">over the course of many months, but even more for the constant interest that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he displayed in our researches. We are grateful to Dr. Hans Mardersteig for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his patience in handling our printing problems. We are especially grateful to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mr. Ronald H. Boothroyd of Verona, who not only nursed our proofs into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">final shape but by his perspicacious reading of our manuscript saved us from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pitfalls and suggested to us new avenues of inquiry.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In our African inquiries we are primarily indebted to Professor Archie N.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tucker of London; to Mr. Jalo Gombe, in North Nigeria; and to Mr. M. B.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nsimbi of Kampala, Uganda. But we wish also to acknowledge the negative</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence produced for us through inquiries in the field by Monsieur R. Hainaut,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">manager of the Banque Beige d'Afrique in Bangui; by the Reverend Father</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tisserant, resident specialist in the native languages of that area; and by the Rev.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Paul F. Metzler at Fort Archambault, the Rev. Dr. O. D. Jobson at Bozoum,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the Rev. T. B. Wimer. Mr. Stavro Skendi of New York supplied us with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our information about Albanian usages. Professor Elliott V. K. Dobbie of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Columbia University advised us in Anglo-Saxon matters; Mons. 1'Abbe Falc'hun</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Faculte des Lettres in Rennes replied to our questions concerning the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Breton vocabulary; and Professor Dr. G. G. Kloeke of the University of Leiden</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kindly assembled for us a wealth of dialectical terms in Dutch. Professor Joshua</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Whatmough of Harvard was especially helpful on two Late Latin problems, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Professor Taylor Starck on questions of Low German dialects. The Rev. Dr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Edgar F. Romig turned up certain words in Pennsylvania Dutch for us, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on Frisian questions we relied on our friends M. Wiegersma of Drachten and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">J. J. van Weringh of Leeuwarden. Professor Dimitry Cizevsky of Harvard,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mrs. Michael Karpovich, and Countess Alexandra Tolstoy were generous in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggestions drawn from their rich experience and fabulous knowledge concern-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing Russian and Ukrainian traditions. On various Slavic matters we were the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grateful recipients of many suggestions and help from Professor Wiktor Wein-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">383</p>

  <p class="calibre1">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES</p>

  <p class="calibre1">traub of Harvard University, Madame Milada Souckova, Max Eastman, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the late Professor Alexander A. Vasiliev. Dr. John P. Hughes gave us aid with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Irish problems; as did with respect to Welsh Professor Robert A. Fowkes of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Columbia University, Professor T. H. Parry Williams of the University Col-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lege of Wales, and Miss Nansi Pugh of the Brearley School. We turned to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Professor Yakov Malkiel of the University of California and Professor Juan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Corominas of Chicago for help in Spanish and Portuguese linguistics; and our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">friend Luiz Marques, of Lisbon, also supplied us with information. We are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">indebted to Don Felix Martorell, distinguished son of Constant! near Tarra-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gona, and to his daughters for having made known to us by infectious demon-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stration the passion for mushrooms that possesses the Catalan people. Our loyal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">friend Andre Chavaneau, bowing to our mania for recondite pursuits, graciously</p>

  <p class="calibre1">conducted us on our first pilgrimage to Serignan, in the Vaucluse. Mr. Peter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">D'Albert of New York was our informant about Romansch. Madame Elisabeth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Kayaloff and Fat'ma Hanoum Natirbov guided us in Circassian questions, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">facilitated our access to information about certain other Caucasian peoples. On</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Eskimo matters Professor L. L. Hammerich of Copenhagen was our mentor,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and for Aleutian words we consulted Dr. Gordon H. Marsh.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Finno-Ugric field we relied on Professor Paavo Ravila of Helsinki and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Professor John Lotz of Columbia University. Professor Georges Dumezil of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the College de France drew our attention to the passage in Saxo Grammaticus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that we quote. We are indebted to Dr. Kaj Jespersen of Copenhagen for clarify-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing certain Danish usages, and to Professor Rolf Nordhagen of Oslo for Nor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wegian dialectical terms. Raymond T. Bond, John D. Gordan, and Alexander</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pinney, all of New York, will discover traces of their influence in our pages,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as will Mrs. Arthur L. Goodhart of Oxford, Eric Whittle of Foulby, near</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wakefield, in Yorkshire, and Professor Georges Malvesin-Fabre of Bordeaux.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. Frederick D. Lascoff and Professor Fanchon Hart of New York helped us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with certain pharmacological questions. Our friend Nicholas Kazenchak, native</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Slovakia, and Mrs. Irene Pulaski guided us in the mycological folk knowledge</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Slovakian peasants. We also received help from individuals inside Ru-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, whom we must thank anonymously.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Semitics we are under great obligations to Professor Thomas W. Thacker,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">head of the School for Oriental Studies in the University of Durham, and to his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">colleagues, A. J. M. Craig and E. Birnbaum. Others of the same distinguished</p>

  <p class="calibre1">faculty who gave us valuable suggestions in oriental languages other than</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Semitic were Arabinda Basu, C. G. Simpson, J. A. Emerton, and R. Dawson.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When it came to the kinship of Tartuffe with truffles, we addressed our ques<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">tions to Professor Frederic G. Hoffherr, then at Columbia University; to</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Professor Alfredo Schiaffrni of the University of Rome; and to Professor Vin-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cenzo Perniconi, the authority on Lorenzo Lippi. Dr. Giorgio Cigliana-Piazza</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cooperated with us in other inquiries in Italy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dr. C. J. Abegg of Zurich introduced us to Professor Dr. Phil. Leonhard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">von Muralt of the University of Zurich, who in turn enlisted for us the aid of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">apothecary Emil Eidenbenz of that city in connection with the odd mushroomic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">behavior attributed to Russian troops who occupied Zurich in 1799. Mr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hans Miiller and Mr. H. de Mandach of the Union Bank of Switzerland in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">troduced us to Dr. J. Schlittler, Pilzkontrolleur of Zurich, who gave us his valued</p>

  <p class="calibre1">opinion on the 'mushroom stone' in the Rietberg Museum. To the authorities</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of that Museum we are indebted for their cooperation in obtaining photographs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the artifact. Mr. Felix Schulthess of the Credit Suisse has given us both en-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">couragement and important help.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the introduction to our book we have spoken of our obligation to the staff</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the New York Public Library. We have also been generously helped by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Miss Elizabeth C. Hall, Librarian of the New York Botanical Garden; Miss</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hazel Gay, Librarian of the American Museum of Natural History, New York;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Miss Meta Harssen of the Pierpont Morgan Library; and the staff of the Frick</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Library, New York. Mr. Herman Sharon aided us with the text of Konrad von</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Megenberg's <i class="calibre4">Das Buck der Natur.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Charles M. Bogert, Chairman and Curator of the Department of Amphibians</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Reptiles at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, demon-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strated some of the ways of toads to us, and his staff were also patient with our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inquiries. Dr. Donald P. Rogers, Curator of the New York Botanical Gardens,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kindly replied to our various mushroomic questions, as did a number of other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">American mycologists: Dr. Carroll W. Dodge, Mrs. Alma H. Beers, and Clyde</p>

  <p class="calibre1">M. Christensen. Mademoiselle Suzanne Pretot was similarly helpful in Paris.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On all ethno-botanical matters, Dr. Hugh C. Cutler, Assistant Director of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Missouri Botanical Museum, was a fount of valuable information, graciously</p>

  <p class="calibre1">given.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In matters of art, Gaston van Camp, Conservateur of the Musees Royaux des</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Beaux Arts de Belgique, turned up much of the material for our discussion of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms in painting. Professor Erwin Panofsky of the Institute for Advanced</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Study at Princeton and Professor Meyer Schapiro of Columbia University</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were gracious and helpful in responding to all our inquiries. Miss Margaret</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alice Murray referred us to the two passages in English chronicles and trials</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where toads figured in attempts at murder. Mr. Edouard de Cosse Brissac</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was the first to bring to our attention the tapestries at Reims depicting Clovis</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in his pagan days going forth to war under the standard of the toads or <i class="calibre4">hots.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the realm of medieval science, Professor Lynn Thorndike put his great</p>

  <p class="calibre1">erudition at our service. Mrs. Michael Majolier ran down certain elusive facts</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for us in London, and Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Kelleher in Italy. Mr. Roger Tory</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Peterson has identified for us certain birds in the Old Masters. Mr. David</p>

  <p class="calibre1">McCurrach and Mr. Ronald G. Cant, both of St. Andrews, Fife, have done</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their best to trace for us the Scottish origins of the Hamilton dynasty of painters.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Warren Delano Robbins kindly pursued certain inquiries for us in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Paris.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We submitted our theory (originally suggested by Mr. Robert Graves)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">concerning the Etruscan mirror to a number of specialists in the field: Mr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bernard Ashmole, Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities of the British</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Museum, Professor Axel Boethius of Goteborg University, Professor Waldemar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Deonna of Geneva, and Professor Charles Picard of Paris. They were hospitable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to our suggestions, and without committing themselves encouraged us to pursue</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our inquires and publish our conclusions. Mr. W. T. O'Dea of the Science</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Museum, South Kensington, helped us with problems of tinder and fire-making,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as did Professor N. Fabritius Buchwald of Copenhagen. Professor Boethius</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was helpful to us on many occasions when we turned to him for advice. David</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Murison, editor of the Scottish National Dictionary, volunteered various refe-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rences that proved fruitful, and Mr. Peter Cooper of Bristol, England, helped</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to clarify certain confusing aspects of Devonshire usage. We thank Mr. David</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chandler for his enthusiastic support of our inquiries.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Professor Sanchez Canton, head of the Prado Museum, and his colleague</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Don Manuel Lorente Junquera, facilitated our inquiries in Madrid in every way.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We are grateful to the former for drawing our attention to Mayno's <i class="calibre4">Adoration,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">and to the latter for revealing to us the mushrooms on the back of the panels of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bosch's <i class="calibre4">Garden of Delight.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The General Director of the Bavarian State Gallery at Munich, Professor Dr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Ernst Buchner, helped and encouraged us in our quest for old masters with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, as did also Dr. Ludwig Miinz, the Director of the Picture Gallery</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Academy of Plastic Arts in Vienna. Professor Amedeo Maiuri of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Museo Nazionale in Naples was indispensable in enlisting the skilled services</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Comm. Professor Gennaro Luciano for the reproduction of the Herculaneum</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fresco, as well as in other ways. We are also grateful to Mr. Carlo Pascal and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mr. Enzo Rossi of the Banco di Napoli for their patience in pursuing the answers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to our various inquiries concerning art treasures in the Naples area. Mr. C. A.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wertheim Aymes of Amsterdam was tireless in turning up Old Masters with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms in the Netherlands and Germany, and we are similarly indebted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to Dr. Carlo Bombieri of the Banca Commerciale Italiana in Milan. Dr. Wil-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">liam E. Suida of the Kress Foundation drew our attention to the oeuvre of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Giuseppe Arcimboldo. Mr. Wango Weng executed the Chinese characters that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we use, and for other help in the Chinese field we thank Dr. Chih Meng,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Director of the China Institute in America. We are grateful to Mr. &amp; Mrs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pierre Chadenet for their timely help. Our five maps were executed for us by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our friend John P. Tremblay of the American Geographical Society.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the section on our Middle American inquiries we have mentioned most of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">those who helped us, but we should be derelict if we did not add the names of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">certain others: Lie. Alfonso Caso, Director of the Institute Nacional Indige-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nista, Arq. Ignacio Marquina, Director of the Institute Nacional de Antropo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logia e Historia, and for his great erudition in Nahuatl linguistics Professor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wigberto Jimenez Moreno, all of Mexico. Above all we wish to express our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">deepest appreciation to Don Agustin Legorreta, President of the Banco Na-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cional de Mexico, and his colleague Don Ladislao Lopez Negrete, as well as to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Bank itself, for the way in which they furthered our plans by introducing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us to the appropriate persons and by placing at our disposal their private plane,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">piloted by that excellent airman, Captain Carlos Borja. Without such hospitable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cooperation we could have accomplished little. In Mexico we were pressed for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">time, and Mexico is not a country that takes time into account. Don Agustin</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and his Bank knew how to gear our necessities with Mexican ways. In Guate-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mala, in addition to the Borhegyis, we were helped and encouraged by Mr.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Mrs. Charles Salino. In both Mexico and Guatemala the General Motors</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Acceptance Corporation saw to it that we never lacked means of highway</p>

  <p class="calibre1">locomotion, for which we thank them. At the New York end of our Middle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">American quest, Dr. Gordon F. Ekholm of the American Museum of Natural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">History gave us indispensable assistance, as did also the American Geographical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Society and its director, Mr. Charles Hitchcock. We have mentioned repeatedly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the help given to us by various members of the Summer Institute of Linguistics.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To those already named we now gladly add John Mclntosh, the Director of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mexican activities, which he supervises from the headquarters in Mexico City</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known as 'the Kettle'. Mr. Alexander C. Herman, vice president of the Na-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tional Container Corporation, helped us solve a troublesome logistical problem</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on our Mexican trips.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By their pressing encouragement and the stream of their fruitful suggestions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for further inquiries on our part, made we hope without malice prepense, a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">number of our friends allowed us no alternative but to complete our undertaking.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">However questionable their intentions and judgment, we are grateful to them:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Roman Jakobson, Rene Lafon, Adriaan Barnouw, Andre Martinet, Kurt Wolff,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Robert Graves, all of whom read our manuscript or the proofs. In a special</p>

  <p class="calibre1">category we acknowledge our heavy indebtedness to Edwin Way Teale and to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Evgenia Lehovich.</p>
