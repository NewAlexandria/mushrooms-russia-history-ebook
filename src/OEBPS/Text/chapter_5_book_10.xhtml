            <p><span class="initial">S</span>cholars have not found the derivation of &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;, and therefore the field lies open for amateur inquirers. The word has circulated in English for some five centuries at least, in many forms, and the variant &lsquo;musheron&rsquo; is still often heard in the United States. It is clear that the English borrowed the word from the French language spoken at court in the Middle Ages, the French word surviving in modern French as <i>mousseron.</i> Either the Normans or French showed the English for the first time that certain wild fungi could be eaten, and the need for a name for the edible fungi was met by &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;. In the course of time it has come to designate edible fungi in general and specifically the psalliota campestris.</p>
            
            <p>This specific use developed later, after the art of cultivating the field mushroom gave to it unique importance &mdash; such importance, indeed, that its French name, <i>champignon,</i> superseded <i>mousseron</i> as the generic word for mushrooms in France. It used to be thought that <i>mousseron</i> sprang from <i>mousse,</i> meaning &lsquo;moss&rsquo;, but for a long time not a single French philologist has espoused what is certainly a popular etymology, which was first propounded in print in 1651 by N. de Bonnefons, the gardener. It is clear that the present spelling of <i>mousseron</i> has come about to satisfy the popular association of ideas. Among the oldest forms of the word in French are two &mdash; <i>moisseron</i> and <i>meisseron</i> &mdash; that could not be linked to moss.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn1" id="cp5b10-r1">[1]</a></sup> Both Oscar Bloch and Albert Dauzat arrive at the conclusion that the word is of pre-Latin origin &mdash; a convenient catchbasin, in the world of Romance languages, for all problem children of etymology.</p>

            <p>Our word is not confined to English and French. Jean-Baptiste Barla, a first-class mycologist and faithful observer, reported that in the Provence, around Nice, the natives say <i>moussairoun</i> and <i>mousselet.</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn2" id="cp5b10-r2">[2]</a></sup> The Catalans speak of the <i>moixerno.</i> The word also appears in a single dialect of Basque, in Lower Navarre, where it takes the form of <i>motxolon.</i> Wherever the word is used on the Continent, in French, Provencal, Catalan, and Basque, it designates the species of mushroom known as the tricholoma gambosum or georgii. The dialectical variants of &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; in English have been numerous, and among them several stem back to the obsolete French forms: mesheroom, mesheroon, and mishroom. There is a Welsh form, <i>maesrin</i> (pronounced &lsquo;mice-rin&rsquo;), which may have been only a bookish word, but which preserves for us the early sound as known to the Welsh when they borrowed it.</p>

            <p>Some years ago Robert Graves suggested to us that we consider the Greek word for mushroom as the source of the French and English terms. We think he was right. Our readers will recall that in German <i>Schivamm</i> means both fungus and sponge, but that the Greeks limited the corresponding word in their language, σπόγγος, to &lsquo;sponge&rsquo;. For mushroom they used μύκης, whence the science of &lsquo;mycology&rsquo;. The Greek word is inextricably associated with μύζα, which in Latin becomes <i>mucus,</i> or when referring to nasal mucus, <i>tnuccus.</i> All these words are repulsive for us. For the Greeks mushrooms were mucoid things, slimy growths, a far remove from the Russians&rsquo; &lsquo;fat of the earth&rsquo;. There is abundant evidence that the Greeks were and remain mycophobes. The evolution of Greek μύκης into the Provencal, Catalan, and obsolete French words is not hard to reconstruct, so far as the first syllable goes.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn3" id="cp5b10-r3">[3]</a></sup></p>

            <p>But this does not solve our problem, for we must still explain the ending <i>-(e}ron</i> of the French word. Proceeding on the surmise that it is a suffix, we sought to determine its value by assembling a list of as many French words ending with it as we could find. (It is surprising that in a language so thoroughly dissected as French no one had done this before.) Our inquiry was fruitful. The nouns ending in <i>-(e)ron</i> fall into three groups, according to the purpose served by the suffix. First are the words that designate an occupation:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <ol>
                    <li><i>bucheron,</i> woodcutter,</li>
                    <li><i>forgeron,</i> blacksmith, and</li>
                    <li><i>vigneron,</i> vine-grower.</li>
                </ol>
            </blockquote>

            <p>There is a second group in which the ending is a diminutive, a variant of the diminutive <i>-on,</i> as in <i>ourson,</i> little bear, and <i>raton,</i> &lsquo;little rat&rsquo;. The variant in <i>-ron</i> is used where there is need to preserve the value of the final silent <i>e</i> of the original noun:<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn4" id="cp5b10-r4">[4]</a></sup></p>

            <blockquote>
                <ol>
                    <li><i>aileron,</i> small wing,</li>
                    <li><i>boteron,</i> small toad,</li>
                    <li><i>chaperon,</i> small headgear,</li>
                    <li><i>coteron, cotteron,</i> diminutive of <i>cotte,</i> English &lsquo;coat&rsquo;,</li>
                    <li><i>courgeron,</i> kind of <i>courge</i> or gourd,</li>
                    <li><i>laideron,</i> an ill-favored woman,</li>
                    <li><i>lisseron, liceron,</i> diminutive of <i>lisse, lice,</i></li>
                    <li><i>mancheron,</i> short sleeve,</li>
                    <li><i>moucheron,</i> gnat,</li>
                    <li><i>napperon,</i> napkin,</li>
                    <li><i>paleron,</i> shoulder-blade,</li>
                    <li><i>pelleron,</i> baker&rsquo;s scoop,</li>
                    <li><i>piqueron,</i> diminutive <i>of pique,</i></li>
                    <li><i>puceron,</i> plant-louse, aphis, and</li>
                    <li><i>vesceron,</i> a small species of vetch, diminutive of <i>vesce.</i></li>
                </ol>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The third group, which is the one relevant to our argument, consists of the following words, of which no less than four refer to mushrooms:</p>

            <!-- XXX: fix layout -->

            <p>In every instance the suffix adds particularity to a less determinate idea conveyed by the stem. The general condenses into the particular. A &lsquo;mass&rsquo; noun becomes a &lsquo;countable&rsquo; one.</p>
            
            <p>Let us examine these fourteen words one by one. <i>A biberon</i> is a feeding-cup or baby&rsquo;s bottle, from the Latin verb <i>bibere.</i> A <i>bourgeron</i> is a jacket made from a material formerly called <i>borge.</i> A <i>longeron</i> is a girder that runs lengthwise. A <i>fumeron</i> is the half-burnt charcoal that gives off smoke. <i>A quarteron is</i> a quadroon. <i>Secheron</i> is the word used in the mountainous east of France to designate a meadow that is chronically parched. The <i>culeron</i> is the &lsquo;crupper loop&rsquo; that passes around the horse&rsquo;s tail. The other words are all names of species of plants. <i>Grateron (=</i> <i>glouteron)</i> is a kind of briar. <i>Laiteron</i> (= <i>laceron, lacheron}</i> is milk-weed. <i>Liceron,</i> from <i>Us,</i> is the bindweed or morning-glory. <i>Potiron</i> is a species of gourd and a fungus. <i>Sauceron</i> is a regional word reported in the Saone-et-Loire for &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;, presumably from the verb <i>saucer,</i> to sop or soak or dunk, referring to the wetness of many wild mushrooms. <i>Auburon</i> is the most interesting of all. It is current in the East, where the French and German worlds meet. It designates the lactarius piperatus, and it comes down from the Latin <i>albus,</i> white. Sometimes it is written <i>oberon.</i> This is a large, fleshy, white mushroom. In a good mushroom season, when the forest floor is carpeted with an immense number of mushrooms of many kinds, the big, sturdy <i>oberon</i> dominates its world, king of its realm. From afar it can be sighted, and as the sun sets and the shadows deepen, its brilliant whiteness seems to catch and hold the light a little longer. It is no wonder that Oberon is king of the fairies. Yet so far as we can discover, no one has hitherto recognized the fungal ties of this famous character in French and German folklore, whom Shakespere summoned to his stage.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn5" id="cp5b10-r5">[5]</a></sup> In Russia the <i><b>auburon</b></i> or lactarius piperatus is called the <i>gmzd&rsquo;,</i> and, as we have seen on an earlier page, <i>the gmzd&rsquo;</i> plays a role in Russia&rsquo;s fungal folklore that recalls Oberon&rsquo;s. Our common nouns ending in <i>-(e)ron</i> are mostly rare and archaic words. Since our etymology for <i>mousseron</i> is persuasive only to the extent that we succeed in explaining its suffix, we welcome the abundant additional testimony supplied to us by a different category of words &mdash; family names. With these proper nouns lies the primary role of our suffix, and it is precisely here that particularity is of the essence: the general term is reduced in its application to a distinctive family unit. Attributes of physique or personality, occupation, geographical origin, social status &mdash; the common nouns and place names become individualized as family names by the addition of <i>-(e)ron.</i> Furthermore, in this list we sense the common denominator that links together the three divisions of our common nouns, and find that they all belong really to a single class, not three. Our suffix, in essence, contributes particularity to the primary word. The reader who desires to arrive at the meaning of these proper nouns will consult Albert Dauzat&rsquo;s <i><b>Dictionnaire</b> Etymologique des Noms de Famille et Prenoms de France,</i> published by Larousse in 1951.</p>

            <p>If, then, we are right in our argument, the mushroom or <i>mousseron</i> was once, metaphorically, a glob of mucus.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn6" id="cp5b10-r6">[6]</a></sup> Its original meaning long forgotten, the word has shifted in status (as occasionally words do), and from its mucoid origins has become appetizing. We believe that the Basque language offers us circumstantial evidence in support of our theory. As we have seen, in the Basque dialect of Lower Navarre our word appears as <i>motxolon,</i> and it carries the same meaning as <i>mousseron</i> in French. In the Souletin dialect the same species is the <i>buxeti;</i> we trace this also to <i>mousseron,</i> for the Romance letter &lsquo;m&rsquo; can become &lsquo;b&rsquo; in Basque; e.g., the Spanish word for &lsquo;mill&rsquo;, <i>molino,</i> appearing as <i>borin</i> or <i>bom</i> in certain Basque dialects; also the French word for &lsquo;cabinet-maker&rsquo; or joiner&rsquo;, <i>memiisier,</i> becoming in Soule <i>beniise.</i> In many other sections of the Basque country, <i>ziza</i> takes the place of <i>motxolon,</i> designating the tricholoma gambosum and also tending to associate itself with other edible species. Thus it is a precise translation of <i>mousseron.</i> The derivation of <i>ziza</i> has never been determined. But we discover that in the Souletin dialect of Basque, <i>zintz</i> means &lsquo;nasal mucus&rsquo;, and is probably a word of imitative origin. Professor Rene Lafon informs us that phonetically <i>ziza</i> could be related to <i>zintz.</i> We suggest that it is derived from <i>zintz</i> or an earlier form of that word, and that it was thus a translation of <i>mousseron</i> made at a time when the original meaning of the French word was still present in men&rsquo;s minds. If we are right, <i>mousseron</i> appears in Basque as <i>motxolon,</i> a borrowed word, in Lower Navarre; as <i>buxeti,</i> also a borrowing, in the Soule; and as <i>ziza,</i> a translation, elsewhere. Thus, if this argument stands up under scrutiny, we provide a satisfying etymology for the Basque <i>ziza</i> and simultaneously buttress our fungal word pattern derived from μύκης.</p>

            <p>For &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; and <i>mousseron</i> we have dared to propose an etymology and a latent meaning where scholars have been at a loss. There is another French fungal word, <i>le cepe de Bordeaux,</i> where we shall challenge the conventional etymology. The standard sources have accepted the popular notion that <i>le cepe</i> is the same word as <i>le ceps de vigne,</i> &lsquo;vine-stock&rsquo;, both descended from the Latin <i>cippus,</i> &lsquo;stake&rsquo;. As to <i>le cepe,</i> we think the case has gone by default, the philologists having admitted a popular etymology by inattention. The boletus edulis does not suggest a stake, nor has such a metaphor any parallel in the fungal vocabulary of Europe.</p>

            <p>We know much about the role of the boletus edulis in the social history of Western Europe. The Romans called it the <i>snillus,</i> &lsquo;swine-mushroom&rsquo;, a word that apparently survived as <i>silli</i> in the dialect of Naples down to the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn7" id="cp5b10-r7">[7]</a></sup> In standard Italian it is <i>the porcino,</i> &lsquo;porcine&rsquo; mushroom. Why these names? Some say the mushroom in its appearance suggests the swarthy, rotund rear-end of a porker. Some point to its greasiness when cooked fresh: it exudes quantities of viscid fluid that gastronomes associate with rich, melted butter, but that to mycophobes suggests loathsome mucus. When dried the boletus edulis tastes like meat, which explains the addiction to it of the monks in the Russian church during the long fasts. We have seen how the Flemings began to eat ceps in the iyth century, a cultural innovation inspired by Italian merchants. The progress of the cep in the kitchens of the great elsewhere was slow. We have combed upwards of a score of French cookbooks of the iyth and 18th centuries and found no mention in them of the cep, though they all speak of morels, truffles, <i>champignons,</i> and <i>mousserons.</i> Brillant-Savarin ignored it, but he ignored all mushrooms save truffles. The earliest French writers on fungi laid no stress on its culinary virtues. Clusius in 1601 described it without embellishment as a species belonging to his Genus XX of the edible mushrooms. He said the Germans called it <i>Btiltz,</i> a Germanized form of the recently borrowed Latin <i>boletus.</i> Clearly the word met the need for an appetising name for mushrooms that were being eaten for the first time. Later <i>Pilz</i> came to embrace the whole edible mushroom world, and the boletus edulis is today the <i>Steinpilz.</i> No one seems to have explained why this mushroom is likened to a stone. Do we have here an evasive substitute for a lost&rsquo; <i>Schweinpilz&rsquo;</i> ? Clusius gave <i>vargdnya</i> as the Magyar name, and he added that it was obscene. Today this word still circulates but its obscene association is lost. Perhaps it suggested <i>valag,</i> &lsquo;arse&rsquo;, of which we may have caught an echo in <i>suillus.</i> We shall revert to Clusius&rsquo; curious remark about obscenity on a later page. Just as baffling is his statement that in French the cep in his day was called <i>materaz.</i> This is a hapax legomenon that both mycologists and lexicographers have overlooked. In what provinces, in what classes, did it circulate?<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn8" id="cp5b10-r8">[8]</a></sup></p>

            <p><i>Cepe</i> entered standard French late. Its earliest known appearance in print was in 1791, in Pierre Bulliard&rsquo;s classic <i>Histoire des Champignons de la France,</i> where he mentions <i>cepe</i> as a provincialism for the edible boletus. In 1835 the French Academy placed on it the stamp of its approval by admitting it to the edition of the <i>Dictionnaire</i> published in that year. There are regions of France where it is still unknown. It entered French from the Gascon dialect, and its diffusion in the ipth century may have been encouraged by a profound man-made change in the ecology of that province. In the late i8th century the French engineer Nicolas Thomas Bremontier undertook to fix the shifting dunes of the Landes, south of Bordeaux, by planting them to conifers. While ceps are mostly associated with deciduous trees, the variety pinicola lives in symbiosis with conifers. Was Bremontier&rsquo;s famous achievement responsible for a surplus of ceps which, funneled through Bordeaux, reached the Paris markets and became the <i>cepes de Bordeaux</i> of today?</p>

            <p>Among the mycophagous Gascons the parent word of <i>cepe</i> carries two meanings. It is the specific name of the boletus edulis and it is a general term for all mushrooms. Here is one more instance where the dominant edible species has given its name to the whole fungal race. The word in Gascon takes two forms, <i>sep</i> and <i>set,</i> and this leads us at last to consider the etymon for <i>cepe.</i> In Spanish p  there are two general words for &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;, <i>hongo</i> and <i>seta.</i> Today in Castilian the two words are synonyms, but from the early dictionary compiled by Sebastian de Covarrubias and published in 1611 we learn that at that time <i>seta</i> meant the <i>hongo de puerco,</i> i. e., the <i>porcino</i> or <i>suillusl</i> In short its meaning was identical with the specific meaning of the Gascon <i>sep</i> or <i>setl</i> The Spanish word circulates up to the very borders of Gascony, and thus the areas of distribution are contiguous. There is a further relevant fact: the word for the boletus edulis is not the only fungal term shared by Gascons and Spaniards. A Spanish word for the puff ball, <i>bejm,</i> is also the Gascon word, and this points to a common background of the two peoples in mushroomic matters. Juan Corominas traces the Spanish <i>seta</i> to a Greek origin, σήπτα, &lsquo;rotten things&rsquo;, to which the English word &lsquo;septic&rsquo; is kin. The name for the cep in classic Greek does not survive, and the way is open for us to suggest that σήπτα already carried its mushroomic meaning before it was borrowed by Gascons and Spaniards. It must have been a learned word of physicians and naturalists steeped in the lore of Dioscorides and Nikander, and it would have reached Gascony, with other Greek cultural contributions, from the Greek colonies in the Gulf of Marseilles, ascending the Rhone valley and crossing westward by the water-ways to the Bay of Biscay. We do not contend that the Gascons borrowed <i>set</i> from the Spaniards, nor that the Spaniards borrowed the Gascon word, but that both came from the same source, borrowed concurrently.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn9" id="cp5b10-r9">[9]</a></sup> We have pointed out that the Greek μύκης likened mushrooms to mucus. Semantically the Greek σήπτα likens the cep to putrid things and to pus. There is a kinship here: thus in French the word <i>morve,</i> nasal mucus, according to the most eminent philologists comes down from the same source <i>asgourme,</i> &lsquo;pus&rsquo;. The ancient background of <i>seta</i> and <i>set,</i> of <i>cepe</i> and &lsquo;cep&rsquo;, is now forgotten, and the mushrooms that they designate have risen to high esteem, like <i>ntousseron,</i> but all these words carry concealed the curse of their mycophobic conception. It is unkind, but piquant, at this late date, to expose their original sin. As for the <i>cepe de Bordeaux,</i> we believe that all those who relish the innocent delights of pedantry may safely speak, in place of <i>cepes,</i> of <i>setes;</i> or, to be more precise, since <i>cepe</i> is a Parisian misspelling of a Gascon <i>cep,</i> we will say <i>les sets de Bordeaux.</i></p>

            <p>In certain localities of France the amanita rubescens is called <i>golmotte</i> and in certain others <i>golmelle.</i> Perhaps the root of these words, <i>golm-</i> was originally <i>gortn-,</i> and if this surmise prove right, then here we have further examples in French of mushroom names nourished on pus. In words of this kind, which live out their lives in humble currency, on tongues of country folk rather than on the written page, remote from the cerebrations of book-men, all sorts of &lsquo;contaminations&rsquo; and blends take place, through semantic or phonetic associations that are hard to trace. Take <i>golmelle and golmotte</i> as examples. Let us assume that <i>gourme,</i> &lsquo;pus&rsquo;, is their point of departure. By gradations, and probably under the pressure of lateral influences, these words pass through a spectrum of identifiable shadings until they emerge as the Proven9al <i>cougoumello,</i> already discussed on an earlier page:</p>

            </figure>

            <p>We have discovered no evidence that the detached attitude of the Greeks toward the fungi, which they expressed by calling them globs of mucus, was ever associated with toads. But the figure of speech latent in their word suggests certain names for toads current among the northern peoples. The Welsh <i><b>llyffant</b></i> seems to be cognate with either &lsquo;slime&rsquo; or &lsquo;lymph&rsquo; &mdash; it makes little difference for our purpose, for both would refer to the mucoid secretion of the toad&rsquo;s epidermal glands. There was an Anglo-Saxon word for toad, <i>yce,</i> which survives to this day through collateral descent in the Low German <i>utze</i> and the High German <i>Unke.</i> These words appear to be related to the Latin <i>uvidus,</i> moist, and are thus semantically parallel to the Welsh term. In the vast reaches of uncharted cultural history-who knows; &mdash; the mucus-exuding toad and the glob of Hellenic mucus that the English call a toadstool may have mingled in the thoughts of men.</p>

            <p>Now we arrive at another area in Europe&rsquo;s mushroom vocabulary where a theme semantically related to mucus may survive. We refer to the neglected problem presented by the word &lsquo;morel&rsquo;. In French this is the <i>morille,</i> in Catalan <i>murgula,</i> in German <i>Morchel.</i> The Romansch <i>murachel</i> or <i>burachel</i> (with the stress on the second syllable) is another form. Western philologists assert that these words come to us from the Old High German <i>morha</i> and its diminutive counterpart, <i>morhila,</i> both of which are known to us only in the sense of &lsquo;carrot&rsquo; or &lsquo;parsnip&rsquo;. The semantic link with carrots or parsnips is an unhappy one and hardly persuasive. The Western philologists who have considered the problem seem not to have stretched their inquiry to embrace the Slavic field. We do not believe that the morel was called a parsnip, nor the parsnip a morel. We believe that both owe their names to the same antecedent metaphor, phallic in inspiration. There is a single name for the morel throughout the Slavic area, and the Russian <i>smorchok</i> may be taken as representative of the various forms that the word assumes. Slavic philologists are agreed on its origin. They say its root is smurk, and semantically it is associated with sniffling, with resin in the tree, with a water-spout. The Russian verb <i>smorkat</i> means to blow the nose. The Slavic root is derived from a hypothetical Indo-European root, [s]mer, denoting an oily or buttery or resinous or viscid exudate. It is exemplified by the English word &lsquo;smear&rsquo;, the Scandinavian <i>smjor,</i> meaning &lsquo;butter&rsquo;, and the Greek jiupov, &lsquo;ointment&rsquo;. If &lsquo;morel&rsquo; and the other Western names for this fungus are not genetically identical with the Slavic word, we are faced with a surprising accidental similarity between the two names for the identical fungal species.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn10" id="cp5b10-r10">[10]</a></sup> Surely a more sensible explanation is at hand. In his beautiful monograph on the aphrodisiacs entitled <i>Paneros,</i> Norman Douglas pointed out that both carrot and parsnip were formerly esteemed for their love-inciting virtue, and is it not reasonable to suppose that the Old High German <i>morha</i> and <i>morhila,</i> like the phallic &lsquo;morel&rsquo;, were verbal progeny of the same erotic root?</p>

            <p>We have suggested that the specific name in ancient Greek for the morel was μύκης a word that we think doubled for &lsquo;morel&rsquo; and &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; generally. Here let us recall a curious episode told by Pausanias in his <i>Description of</i> <i>Greece</i> which reminds us of the idea lying behind <i>smorchok.</i> Pausanias offers his readers a legendary explanation for the founding of the famous city of Mycenae. It seems that Perseus chose the site. &ldquo;Perseus was thirsty, and the thought occurred to him to pick up a mushroom [μύκης] from the ground. Drinking with joy the water that flowed from it, he gave to the place the name of Mycenae.&rdquo; This is a false popular etymology for the name of the city, but the story itself, attributing a life-giving fluid to the mushroom, reminds us of <i>smorchok</i> and its congeners, and links them semantically, though not etymologically, with the Greek μύκης. We feel sure that μύκης here meant &lsquo;morel&rsquo;. In the light of the evidence developed on earlier pages, it is singularly appropriate that our eponymous hero should found his race by imbibing strength from the phallic mushroom. Fortifying our argument, Ovid in <i>Metamorphoses</i> vii: 392 recalls the legendary origin of Corinth: &ldquo;Here, according to ancient tradition, in earliest time men&rsquo;s bodies sprang from mushrooms&rdquo;:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>&hellip; hie aevo veteres mortalia primo corpora<br/>
                    vulgarunt pluvialibus edita fungis.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><i>Fungis</i> here stands for μύκης and μύκης for &lsquo;morel&rsquo;. The children of Corinth, like the children of Mycenas and of Rome, are sprung from the fungal phallus, from the fire-born tinder quickened into flame by the touch of the divine spark. Corinth was a center of the sun-cult, and it is fitting that the children of Corinth should owe their genesis to the μύκης.</p>

            <p>We have seen on an earlier page that &lsquo;spunk&rsquo; in English is a name for the seminal flow of the human male, that the ordinary mushroom stipe sunk in the pileus is the symbol of the sexual act, and that the Greek μύκης; means not only &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; (or &lsquo;morel&rsquo;) but the <i>membrum virile.</i> Perhaps the same idea lies enfolded in the Indo-European root of the Russian <i>smorchok.</i> There is a Norwegian word, <i>troll-smor,</i> or the demon&rsquo;s butter, for the yellowish slime-moulds that are often found spilling over rotten stumps and that scientists call &lsquo;myxomycetes&rsquo;. We find the identical fungal figure of &lsquo;demon&rsquo;s butter&rsquo; in the non-Indo-European Burushaski language: <i>pfute maltas,</i> the first element meaning &lsquo;demon&rsquo;. It is our suggestion that &lsquo;butter&rsquo; in such fungal words scarce conceals the erotic meaning, corresponding to the erotic vulgarism <i><b>frontage</b></i> in the French <i>langue verte,</i> and the special meaning of &lsquo;spunk&rsquo; in England. In low English &lsquo;cheese&rsquo; is the designation for smegma. In Syriac there is a word for &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;, <i>fmama,</i> that C. Brockelman in his <i>Lexicon Syriacum</i> (1928) derives from the Greek words for &lsquo;ointment&rsquo;, &lsquo;unguent&rsquo;: a|i^[jLa and ojjLvjy^a.</p>

            <p>In Russian the word <i>nasmork</i> (with stress on the first syllable) designates a cold accompanied by a running nose &mdash; the French <i>chandelle.</i> According to Dal&rsquo;, the Russian lexicographer, impudent Russian seminarists used to refer to an <i>arkhierejskij nasmork,</i> &lsquo;archpriest&rsquo;s rhinitis&rsquo;, when speaking of gonorrhoea.</p>

            <p>The full sweep of the erotic associations of the fungi in men&rsquo;s minds emerges with laconic clarity in Pliny&rsquo;s description of them in Book 22, Chapter 46 of his <i>Natural History.</i> Indeed his few words touch on almost all the scatological and genito-urinary aspects of our subject that we have had occasion to uncover, a prescient precis of this aspect of our subject written eighteen centuries ago. The Elizabethan translators, culturally far closer to the Romans than we, sometimes caught overtones that our modern scholars, with all their erudition, miss, and therefore we supply Philemon Holland&rsquo;s expansive rendering of the passage in Pliny, and we underline the words that may refer to the seminal fluid:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Volvam enim terra ob hoc prius gignit, ipsum postea in volva, ceu in ovo est luteum &hellip;
                    Origo prima causaque e limo, et acescente succo madentis terrae, aut radicis fere glandiferas: initioque spuma lentior, dein corpus membranse simile, mox partus.</p>

                <p>And in truth, before that the Mushrome is formed, the earth bringeth forth a certain pellicle or coat first, called in Latine Volva; for this purpose, that the Mushrome should lie in it: and then afterwards shee engendreth it enclosed within, much like as the yolke of an egg couched within the white &hellip; Moreover, these Mushromes take their first originall and beginning of a slinlie mud, and the humor of the earth that is in the way of corruption: or else of some root of a tree, and such for the most part as bear Mast. <i>It seemeth at the first, as if it were a kind of glutinous fame or froth:</i> then it groweth to the substance of a pellicle or skin, and soone after sheweth the Mushrome indeed, bred, formed and consummat within, as beforesaid.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Sensitive as is Philemon Holland&rsquo;s rendering, we think that in Pliny&rsquo;s own words our ear detects, clear albeit faint, a double layer of meaning that escaped the English translator. Pliny mentions no particular kind of tree, such as the oak. He links mushrooms with such trees as bear &lsquo;mast&rsquo;, i.e., acorns. The acorns are the thing. His word is <i>glandiferce.,</i> &lsquo;acorn-bearing&rsquo;. Already in Pliny&rsquo;s time the word for &lsquo;acorn&rsquo; <i>-glans-</i> also designated the glans penis. This we know from the writings of his contemporary, the physician Celsus. It was natural for Pliny to place mushrooms, soaked as they were with erotic meaning, at the foot of trees yielding equally erotic acorns. The ancient association of ideas survived into the iyth century when John Parkinson referred to the glans penis as &lsquo;the nut of the yard&rsquo;.</p>

            <p>At this point in our argument the reader may protest that our interpretation of Pliny&rsquo;s text is over-bold. But before he leaps to his conclusion let him consider the following evidence. We have seen that in the Greek mind &lsquo;mucus&rsquo; and &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;, μύζα and μύκης, were yoked together, perhaps with the morel playing a phallic role as an intermediary. We have seen that the word for mushroom also meant the <i>membrurn virile,</i> and if our interpretation of the Etruscan mirror is sound, the mushroom and <i>membrum virile</i> were intimately associated with the making of fire. We now call to the reader&rsquo;s attention certain further semantic associations with fire that link together the two Greek words. The word for mushroom also meant the half-carbonized end of a wick, which in English is called the snuff &mdash; a word with nasal ties. This half charred end of a wick is of course tinder. The Greek word for mucus also meant the nozzle of a lamp. This same Greek word for mucus crops out in Latin as <i>myxa,</i> and in Latin it meant &lsquo;wick&rsquo;, and we discover that in Latin <i>fungus</i> was the snuff of a wick. The Latin word for &lsquo;wick&rsquo; in turn gave to the French their <i>meche,</i> and from the French the English acquired &lsquo;match&rsquo;. Why should the match that we strike come down to us from Greek words for mucus and mushroom? Why this persistent association between fire on the one hand, and mucus and mushrooms on the other, with the <i>membrum virile</i> also playing a role in the same affair? In low English &lsquo;wick&rsquo; is still potent with erotic meaning, as the English soldier lets us know when he &lsquo;dips his wick&rsquo; or complains that someone &lsquo;gets on his wick&rsquo;. The cap of a morel suggests a burnt clump of tinder, and what is a nozzle but a &lsquo;cock&rsquo;? Both &lsquo;nozzle&rsquo; and &lsquo;schnozzle&rsquo; are variants of &lsquo;nose&rsquo;.</p>

            <p>For the burnt end of a candle-wick the Spaniards have two expressions: <i>moco de pabilo,</i> &lsquo;mucus of the wick&rsquo;, and <i>seta,</i> the word for mushroom that Corominas traced to the Greek word for putrid things. In French the corresponding word is <i>moucheron,</i> from <i>moucher,</i> meaning to snuff and to wipe the nose. When a lighted candle sputters and gutters because of the presence of a foreign particle, called in English the &lsquo;thief or the &lsquo;stranger&rsquo;, the French speak of it as the <i>champignon;</i> and the French call a running nose a <i>chandelle,</i> or candle. In English until modern times the burnt end of a candle-wick was a &lsquo;snot&rsquo;, but when this word in its primary sense fell into disrepute around A.D. 1800, its place was taken by &lsquo;snuff&rsquo;. The Danish verb <i>snyde,</i> from the same root as the English &lsquo;snot&rsquo;, means both to snuff a candle and to wipe the nose; and the Dutch <i>snotneus</i> is an old-fashioned oil lamp with a long spout. But in the Germanic languages the fungal association seems to be absent. We have mentioned the word for &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; in Syriac, <i>semama:</i> we now point out that it carries the additional meaning of &lsquo;lamp black&rsquo;.</p>

            <p>Here then is a persistent association of ideas, triangular in design, between mucus, mushrooms, and candles or lamps. Like the candle-wick itself, the ideas are plaited together, weaving in and out in a slow measure down the centuries. It is easy to see why the mycophobic Greeks regarded mushrooms as globs of mucus. But why the lamp nozzle? Why the burnt end of the wicke Why the candle?</p>

            <p>Perhaps the reader has already discovered the common denominator that underlies these disparate ideas. Relying on certain straws of evidence, we have conjectured a deep-seated semantic association between nasal mucus and seminal fluid. The primary use of the fungi among the primitive Europeans was for the making of fire, a rite instinct with sexual associations. The Greek member of our &lsquo;sponge&rsquo; cluster, σπόγγος ,was deprived in Greek of its other meaning of &lsquo;fungus&rsquo;, and we discover its normal fungal meanings in [ifoojc;, semantically yoked with the <i>membrum virile</i> and a burnt lamp-wick, a word adapted from [Au£a, meaning &lsquo;mucus&rsquo; and also &lsquo;lamp-nozzle&rsquo;. In the burning candle guttering with heat, in the dripping nozzle of the hot antique lamp, we discover the supreme figure of dynamic sexual metaphor, wherein the discordant ideas of mucus and fire are suddenly and boldly reconciled. In Hungary there are to this day women mindful of their reputation who will refrain from offering a light for a man&rsquo;s cigarette, lest their act suggest an improper invitation. Early in 1955 a late evening television program on channel KABC in Hollywood was abruptly discontinued because of public protests that it offended decency. In it a statuesque blonde called Voluptua would prepare for bed while she chatted invitingly with a man offstage. Just before slipping into her big bed, she would breathe on unlighted candles and they would leap into flame.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn11" id="cp5b10-r11">[11]</a></sup> When Rabelais&rsquo; Friar John, near the end of Book v, swears by the faith of a Lanterner, the attentive reader has learned to catch the meaning, for Rabelais has made a great play with lanterns and candles in this book, especially in chapter 33, where the Queen is served a huge stiff flaming taper of white wax somewhat red at the end, and everyone else has flaming <i>chandelles.</i> &lsquo;Heaven knows&rsquo;, says Rabelais, &lsquo;what a glorious light they gave.&rsquo;</p>

            <p>As we have already said, the Greeks did not link mushrooms with toads but instead with lamps. In Egypt we discover that lamps, in turn, were linked with frogs. (We seem forever discovering new permutations of the same symbols.) For the Egyptians the frog was a symbol of Hiqit, goddess of birth and rebirth, and in various collections of Egyptian artifacts are to be found lamps in the shape of frogs dating from the early centuries of the Christian era.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn12" id="cp5b10-r12">[12]</a></sup> On these lamps is written in Greek: &lsquo;I am the resurrection&rsquo;, and sometimes they bear a cross. They appear to have been artifacts of an heretical sect denounced in the Code of Justinian under the name of Batrachitse, but their batrachian error was certainly of pre-Christian lineage. Just as in Greece the mushroom and the lamp stood for the engendering of life, so in Egypt a similar message found expression in the frog-borne flame. Toads are of the order of frogs, of course. The womb that lies behind certain names for the toad and toadstools in northern Europe reappears in the frog-womb of the Egyptian cult.</p>

            <p>Some of the terms of the science of mycology are neo-classicisms, the inventions of modern workers in the field. But others perpetuate ancient usage. In Pliny&rsquo;s text we have discovered that Volva&rsquo; was already familiar to him as the designation of the cup out of which some mushrooms grow. Do not the &lsquo;ring&rsquo;, the Veil&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;hymenium&rsquo; belong to the same vintage? Here are sexual metaphors applied to mushrooms that reinforce our argument, and what an astonishing concentrate of sexuality they all evoke! If we are right about the sponge cluster of fungal words &mdash; <i>Schwamm, fungus, gomba,</i> and σπόγγος &mdash; they enfold within themselves the idea of the womb. The Greeks in μύκης substituted for the womb the idea of the phallus. The French, by some quirk in cultural history, followed the Greek example, preferring <i>mousseron</i> to a derivative <i>of fungus,</i> and in the second element <i>of champignon</i> is the same phallic idea latent? Not etymologically, of course, but by phonetic association. Gastronomically the Greeks, as we said, were mycophobes. Their interest in the fungi was less aural and gustatory than erotic. In Arabic the basic word for a mushroom is <i>futr,</i> as we saw on page 127, with the initial /by normal mutation often yielding place to <i>p.</i> The Arabists seem in no doubt about its etymology: it comes from the verb &lsquo;to split&rsquo;, &lsquo;to cleave&rsquo;, and they suggest that this recalls the breaking of the earth as the mushroom emerges. But so jejune a notion does less than justice to the virile Arabian mind. Here also we think we detect a metaphor of generation, probably at the deepest layer onomatopceic in origin, paralleling in sense and sound the Greek φιτύω, Latin <i>futuere,</i> and French <i>foutre,</i> though etymologically unrelated to these.</p>

            <p>Mushroom, candle, nose: down to today these metaphors have retained their phallic potency. The phallus is called a mushroom, and on certain mushrooms even mycologists bestow phallic names: the phallus impudicus and the mutinus caninus. A learned friend of ours, always on the alert on our behalf for tidbits of fungal knowledge, was thumbing one day through a native Pashto dictionary, when in its pages he came upon a name, not Pashto but Persian, for a mushroom, small and edible but not otherwise identified: <i>qabih-ker</i> <i>i xarak,</i> which means the <i>phallus erectus</i> of a jackass. A few months later he came upon the exact equivalent in Pashto: <i>xargina.</i> In Sudanese we find a mushroom called <i>zibb al-wata ,</i> &lsquo;penis of the earth&rsquo;, and in Persian the identical fungal metaphor in <i>kuldhi zamin.</i></p>

            <p>There must be many such terms that have escaped the nets of word-collectors. For metaphorical usage in the reverse order we find ample documentation, notably in the <i>langne verte</i> of France as captured and delicately served up in Alfred Delvau&rsquo;s <i>Dictionnaire Erotiaue Moderne,</i> an undated work published in Bale. To one Alexander Pothey he ascribes this ditty on the <i>champignon de couche</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn13" id="cp5b10-r13">[13]</a></sup></p>

            <blockquote>
                Si son champignon Ressemble<br/>
                a son piton [nose], Quel<br/>
                champignon -gnon, -gnon,<br/>
                Qu&rsquo;il a, Gandon -don, -don!
            </blockquote>

            <p>In the early days of motor cars the accelerator was called in French a <i>champignon,</i> and &lsquo;to step on the gas&rsquo; was <i>ecraser le champignon,</i> an expression that French gentlemen hesitated to use in the presence of ladies.</p>

            <p>As for la chandelle, elle brule, elle coule, et ensuite elle fond. It is noteworthy that in this erotic sense, only <i>chandelle</i> is used and never <i>bougie</i> nor <i>cierge.</i> Thus when a Frenchman with generous courtesy disclaims knowledge of an alleged adulterous liaison, he is almost certain to remark that il ne tenait pas la chandelle &mdash; an observation that refers to either of two degrees of intimate knowledge. Shakespere knew well this double meaning. In <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> Lorenzo addresses his mistress:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer. To which that provocative minx Jessica, fully alert, replies: What, must I hold a candle to my shames?</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>That same candle burns fiercely when Falstaff erupts with his thunderous pasan to carnal love in the <i>Merry Wives,</i> which he rounds off with a staggering line:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Send me a coole rut-time, Jove, or who can blame me to pisse
                    my Tallow?</p>
            </blockquote>


            <p>The burning tallow-candle is the symbol of office carried by Robin Goodfellow when he enters upon the nocturnal rites of his coven, as is shown in the woodcut that we have reproduced on an earlier page. Who can hold a candle to this proud Devil?</p>

            <p>A proverb dating back to ancient Rome and Ennius observes that when a lantern gives light to a candle, the giver by the gift is made none the poorer. Innocent in itself, this old saw takes on an erotic sense when Chaucer&rsquo;s Wife of Bath in her <i>Prologue</i> admonishes her doddering husband not to begrudge her dalliance with other men. Here the candle is phallic and the lantern is the &lsquo;queynte&rsquo; or pudendum:</p>

            <blockquote>
                For, certeyn, old dotard, by youre leve,<br/>
                Ye shul have queynte right ynogh at eve.<br/>
                He is to greet a nygard that wolde werne [forbid]<br/>
                A man to lighte a candle at his lanterne.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Let us revert to Pothey&rsquo;s suggestion about Gandon&rsquo;s <i>piton.</i> He was echoing an ancient folk-belief general in Europe and also in America:</p>

            <blockquote>
                Regarde au nez et tu verras combien Grand<br/>
                est celui qui aux femmes fait bien. Regarde au<br/>
                pied pour au rebours connaitre Quel le<br/>

            <p>Thomas Wright in <i>A History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art,</i> published in London in 1875, reproduced the figure of a Roman <i>mimus</i> as preserved for us in an engraved onyx. A vulgar character given to indecent roles in the low comedy of the time, the <i>mimus</i> in this case is adorned with a pendulous nose that speaks eloquently for its lengthy alter ego, and in his whole get-up he seems intended to illustrate the quatrain found in Delvau:</p>

            <blockquote>
                CEil etincelant, Doigt<br/>
                vif et galant, Nez de<br/>
                bon augure Et bonne<br/>
                figure.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Let no reader balk at these baudy citations, for they serve only to confirm the continuing vitality of the layers of meaning that we suggest for Pliny and Pausanias, and that without these citations might appear to secluded scholars both tenuous and wilfully indelicate. All things sprout from the μύζα and the μύκης, in union with σήπτα.</p>

            <p>Yes, σήπτα, the Greek word that has given us the Spanish <i>seta</i> and we think the French <i>cepe,</i> words whose primary fungal meaning was the boletus edulis. Corominas in his note on <i>seta</i> pointed out that in widely scattered parts of Spain it has also designated the cunnus.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn14" id="cp5b10-r14">[14]</a></sup> We suspect that in this sense also <i>seta</i> goes back to an original Greek usage, and that σήπτα stood symbolically for the female counterpart of the μύκης, &lsquo;cep&rsquo; and &lsquo;morel&rsquo; being sexually complementary. Under its swarthy mons the cep when heated turns soft and yields a mucoid exudate. In the fungal vocabulary of the Gascons we discover the same obscene figure of speech, though a different word is used. This pejorative term is for the boleti that turn blue on exposure to air. Professor Jean Seguy in his Gascon linguistic map 201 reports it as <i>kunsanmas,</i> and behind the face of this strange word he discovers <i>cunnu sagma,</i> which in French would be <i>con d&rsquo;anesse.</i></p>

            <p>We are far from having exhausted the complex of interrelated meanings. In various parts of Spain <i>seta</i> carries the sense of &lsquo;swollen lips&rsquo;, &lsquo;snout&rsquo;. With the other erotic meanings before us, we suggest that it is impermissible innocence not to see in these lips the labia majora and ring.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn15" id="cp5b10-r15">[15]</a></sup></p>

            <p>In Middle Flemish there was a word <i>sete</i> that was used in the oath <i>bi Cools sete,</i> &lsquo;by Nick&rsquo;s arse&rsquo;, corresponding to the Old French <i>por le cul lien.</i> Apparently the origin of the Flemish word has not been determined. When we have in mind the sexual associations of the cep in Spanish and the obscene association that Clusius pointed out in Magyar, we suggest that the Flemish word is another semantic extension of our mushroomic word, with a scatological rather than an erotic emphasis.</p>

            <p>In Old French we also find a word <i>sete.</i> It survives in seven or eight citations. Its meaning has never been certain. It was used always as a simile for stench: the leper&rsquo;s boils stink like <i>sete.</i> In recent years several scholars have examined the word and suggested that it might mean &lsquo;excrement&rsquo; or &lsquo;latrine&rsquo; or &lsquo;privy seat&rsquo; or &lsquo;arse&rsquo;. One of them linked it with the Flemish word. Surely here also we discover our mushroomic word, in its scatological phase. If we are right, the word was circulating in French seven centuries ago, disappeared, and then re-entered as <i>cepe</i> in the 18<sup>th</sup> century.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn16" id="cp5b10-r16">[16]</a></sup></p>

            <p>Today in southern Europe the fig is used metaphorically as the boletus edulis used to be. To the mushroom and fig we must add the third of the trinity, the medlar, that fruit which is properly enjoyed only when rotten ripe. Down to Shakespere&rsquo;s time it was known also as the openarse, a name that survives in dialectical use until now. Shakespere played with the words in what are perhaps his most scabrous lines, in Act n, Sc. i <i>of Romeo and Juliet,</i> the lines that are said to have prompted Logan Pearsall Smith, in his little book on Shakespere, to exclaim how lucky it was that only specialists sensed the range and depth of Shakespere&rsquo;s indecencies:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>&lsquo;He can&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;, the shocked reader cries out; but oh, my dear reader, he does mean it, and his meaning, if you are a nice person, will make you blush all over.</p>
                <p> <i>[On Reading Shakespeare,</i> p. 9]</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>But Shakespere was not inventing his imagery. He was drawing on a fund of erotic symbolism of immemorial antiquity. In English the word &lsquo;medlar&rsquo; was re-shaped to pun with the verb &lsquo;to meddle&rsquo;, in the erotic sense now little used; but etymologically medlar was identical with the French <i>nefle</i> and the Spanish <i>nispero,</i> and all three descend from the Greek μέσπιλον, where the philologists stop, saying they find no earlier root. But surely the Greek word, broken down into its two elements, incapsulates our same erotic metaphor, meaning &lsquo;amidst the hair&rsquo;, where the second element, πιλον, is the word that comes down to us in the mushroomic &lsquo;pileus&rsquo;. Just as the erotic association of the boletus edulis seems to have passed over to the scatological in Flanders and France, so the <i>nefle</i> becomes the <i>cul-de-chien</i> in the east of France.</p>

            <p>When Corominas hit on σήπτα as the etymon for <i>seta,</i> he may not have divined the nest of felicitous semantic associations that support his discovery. The Greek word belongs to a cluster that includes σηφ, the designation of a poisonous serpent. The Greeks believed that mushrooms and serpents and the holes of serpents had an affinity for each other, just as the peoples of northern Europe link mushrooms with toads. In the Dorian dialect we discover the variant σάπω, identical phonetically though not semantically with the Spanish word for &lsquo;toad&rsquo;, <i>sapo.</i> We submit that just as the Italian <i>scorzone,</i> &lsquo;poisonous serpent&rsquo;, gives us the Spanish <i>escuerzo,</i> a second word for &lsquo;toad&rsquo;, so the Greek word offers us a parallel herpetological metamorphosis.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b10-fn17" id="cp5b10-r17">[17]</a></sup> The snake-mushroom association of Greece and the Indie world, with all its baggage of associations, becomes the toad and toadstool glyph of the West. With all these symbols woven together, we are hardly surprised when we discover that Emile Boisacq in his Greek etymological dictionary links the Greek words that we are now discussing with the Sanskrit <i>kydku,</i> &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;.</p>

            <p>As for phallic &lsquo;noses&rsquo;, surely nowhere in literature is there another such apostrophe to them as Laurence Sterne composed in Part iv of <i>Tristram Shandy,</i> along with the chapters that lead up to and away from that noble excursus. Here indeed is a savory dish of salacious mushrooms, a display of candles enflamed. The baby Tristram, we learn, had got his &lsquo;nose&rsquo; smashed at birth, whereupon his father, all disconsolate, had embarked on an exhaustive study of &lsquo;noses&rsquo; and their sizes. He read Erasmus, with scant satisfaction, and then turned to the authors that had concentrated on his topic, to wit, Prignitz, Scroderus, Andrea Paraeus, Bouchet&rsquo;s <i>Evening Conferences,</i> and finally the unrivalled Hafen Slawkenbergius, who in the course of his stupendous opus pauses at one point to recall how for a full month all Strasbourg, both the Lutheran and Catholic factions, had once been set by the ears because of a certain long &lsquo;nose&rsquo; and the awe and incredulity with which everyone, of every age, in every walk of life, of low and high degree, viewed its dimensions.</p>

            <p>In a paragraph of concise and damning irony Tristram describes the monumental &lsquo;nasal&rsquo; monograph of Slawkenbergius, and what he says causes us to tremble, for his words are equally applicable to this our own beloved treatise. If the reader will substitute us for Slawkenbergius, and mushrooms for the noses that are their metaphorical synonyms, he will learn what we consider a truthful and humiliating appraisal of our own enterprise:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>And to do justice to Slawkenbergius [says Tristram], he has entered the list with a stronger lance, and taken a much larger career in it than any one man who had ever entered it before him, and indeed, in many respects, deserves to be ennich&rsquo;d as a prototype for all writers, of voluminous works at least, to model their books by &mdash; for he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject &mdash; examined every part of it dialectically &mdash; then brought it into full day: dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision of his own natural parts could strike &mdash; or the profoundest knowledge of the sciences had impowered him to cast upon it &mdash; collating, collecting, and compiling &mdash; begging, borrowing, and stealing, as he went along, all that had been wrote or wrangled thereupon in the schools and porticos of the learned: so that Slawkenbergius his book may properly be considered, not only as a model &mdash; but as a thorough &mdash; stitched DIGEST and regular institute of <i>noses</i> [that is, <i>mushrooms],</i> comprehending in it all that is or can be needful to be known about them.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Defying Tristram, we return to trie &lsquo;long nose&rsquo;. When a German macht eine lange Nase, he is doing what a Frenchman does when the latter fait un pied de nez, for in this expression the Frenchman speaks not of a pedal extremity but of twelve good inches and true. For the same rude gesture the Englishman says that he cocks a snook, and the American thumbs his nose. On July 4, 1936, a certain Nazi official known as Herr Greiser drew world attention to himself by thumbing his nose at the League of Nations in Geneva. The correspondent Vernon Bartlett in his dispatch to the London <i>News Chronicle,</i> using the English idiom, declared baldly that the man had &lsquo;cocked a snook&rsquo;. There followed a lively discussion in the British press. Winston Churchill used the vulgar term in Commons, and thus it gained a nosehold in Hansard. For a month readers of <i>The Times</i> addressed letters to their editor about the episode and the gesture, letters urbane and amusing, but sadly genteel. Only the most knowledgeable and perceptive reader could have detected the obscene inspiration of the antique gesture. Yet in those circles where low words pass as common coin, the fleeting passage of thumb and fingers across the nose finds its natural accompaniment in two terse English syllables that tell the story. Here once more we come up against that <i>chandelle,</i> that <i>champignon, that pied de nez,</i> of the vulgar Roman mimus. The &lsquo;snook&rsquo; is a pendulous appendage. From the main body of the Holy Isle of Lindisfarne there stretches out a lengthy promontory, and we understand, when we look at the chart, why the Northumbrian folk know that promontory as &lsquo;The Snook&rsquo;. He who cocks a snook cocks a &lsquo;nose&rsquo;.</p>

            <p>If there be those who are sceptical of this meaning, let them read Chapter xix of Rabelais&rsquo; <i>Pantagruel,</i> wherein Panurge and the Englishman engage in a unique colloquy. As neither speaks the other&rsquo;s language, the conversation goes forward with gestures, in the presence of the villagers, who follow it with rapt attention and the enjoyment that is the proof of understanding. Panurge starts off by cocking a snook at the Englishman, who replies in kind. Never have there been more eloquent performances of the ancient sign, nor description thereof put on paper with such solemn elaboration of detail. Here is Rabelais&rsquo; text, which we offer with only one further comment: where Rabelais speaks of <i>la pinne du nez,</i> W. F. Smith in his admirable translation hit on &lsquo;the gristle of the nose&rsquo;, an inspired rendering, since in certain English dialects &lsquo;gristle&rsquo; means &lsquo;nose&rsquo; and also the <i>membrum virile:</i></p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Panurge soubdain leva en l&rsquo;aer la main dextre, puis d&rsquo;icelle mist le poulce dedans la navire d&rsquo;icelluy coste, tenant les quatre doigtz estendus &amp; serrez par leur ordre en ligne parallele a la pinne du nez, fermant l&rsquo;ceil gausche entierement, &amp; guignant du dextre avecq profonde depression de la sourcille, et paulpiere. Puis la gausche leva hault, avecques fort serrement &amp; extension des quatre doigtz &amp; elevation du poulce, &amp; la tenoit en ligne directement correspondante a l&rsquo;assiete de la dextre, avec distance entre les deux d&rsquo;une coubdee &amp; demie. Cela faict, en pareille forme baissa contre terre l&rsquo;une et l&rsquo;aultre main: finablement les tint on milieu comme visant droict au nez de l&rsquo;Anglois.</p>

                <p>&hellip; Lors feist l&rsquo;Anglois tel signe. La main gausche toute ouverte il leva hault en l&rsquo;aer, puis ferma au poing les quatre doigtz d&rsquo;icelle, &amp; le poulce estendu assit sus la pinne du nez. Soubdain apres leva la dextre toute ouverte, &amp; toute ouverte la baissa, joignant le poulce au lieu que fermoit le petit doight de la gausche, &amp; les quatre doigtz d&rsquo;icelle mouvoit lentement en l&rsquo;aer. Puis au rebours feit de la dextre ce qu&rsquo;il avoit faict de la gausche, &amp; de la gausche ce que avoit faict de la dextre.</p>

                <p>Panurge suddenly raised in the Air his right Hand, then placed its Thumb within his Nostril on that Side, holding his four Fingers extended and closed in their order in a Line parallel with the Gristle of the Nose, shutting the left Eye entirely, and blinking with the right with a profound Depression of the Eyebrow and Lid; then he raised the left Hand aloft with hard Clinching and Extension of the four Fingers and Elevation of the Thumb, and he held it in a Line directly corresponding to the Position of the right Hand, with a Distance between them of a Cubit and a half. This done, in like form he lowered towards the Earth both one and the other Hand; lastly, he held them in the Midst as though he were aiming straight at the Nose of the Englishman.</p>

                <p>Then the Englishman made a Sign like this: His left Hand wide open he raised high in the Air, then closed into his Fist the four Fingers thereof, and placed the Thumb extended on the Gristle of his Nose. Suddenly afterwards he raised the Right wide open, and while wide open lowered it, joining the Thumb at the Place where the little Finger of the left Hand closed, and the four Fingers thereof he moved slowly in the Air; then reversing them he did with the Right what he had done with the Left, and with the Left what he had done with the Right.

This would be the oldest citation of our word. But Professor Joshua Whatmough of Harvard has shown that it is an interpolation. Of the seven ms. sources for Anthimus, five that go back in part independently to the archetype do not include the passage in which this word occurs. Of the other two, one is an nth century ms. and the other refers to an event that took place in A.D. 849. The evid ence seems to point to the 9th century for the interpolation.&nbsp;<a href="#cp5b10-r1">&#8617;</a></li>

But Jacob Grimm in his <i>Teutonic Mythology,</i> London, 1883, vol. n, p. 453, links &lsquo;Alberich&rsquo; with whiteness, from the Latin <i>albus,</i> a view that, as we now discover, is reinforced by the vernacular name given to the dazzling-white lactarius piperatus along the eastern marches of the French-speaking world.&nbsp;<a href="#cp5b10-r5">&#8617;</a></li>

But this word <i>mousse</i> and its homonym meaning &lsquo;moss&rsquo; are so tangled together in their histories that we merely mention the pos sibility without arguing the case. The obsolete <i>meckeron,</i> &lsquo;wick&rsquo;, &lsquo;little wick&rsquo;, was derived through Latin from Gr. |iu£a, and is cousin therefore to <i>meisseron, tnoisseron, mousseron.</i> Surely the obsolete adjective <i>mescheros,</i> &lsquo;dirtied&rsquo;, &lsquo;blackened&rsquo;, has the same derivation and refers to the wick&rsquo;s snuff. Philologists have been baffled by the origin <i>oftndchurer,</i> &lsquo;to blacken with soot&rsquo;, and <i>mdchuron,</i> &lsquo;smudge&rsquo; or &lsquo;smut&rsquo; (on the face), &lsquo;smudged impression&rsquo; (in printing).

It meant (a) one shape of distiller&rsquo;s flask, and (b) in archery, the particular kind of blunt head for the &lsquo;bolt&rsquo; or arrow used with the cross-bow when the purpose was to stun and incapacitate an enemy or animal without penetra ting the armor or hide.

I of his <i>Atlas Linguistique de la</i> <i>Gascogne,</i> maps 193&ndash;201, especially those dealing with <i>cepe</i> and <i>champignon.</i> In certain sub-dialects of Gascony the terminal <i>p</i> of a Latin etymon becomes <i>ts</i> in the Gascon plural; e. g., French <i>coups</i> appears as <i>cots.</i> Our initial supposition that the variation between <i>sep</i> and <i>set</i> was traceable to this phenomenon collapsed when we discovered from Seguy&rsquo;s maps that the distribution of the two forms did not correspond at all to those sub-dialects. We suggest that the alternation between <i>p</i> and <i>t</i> in <i>sep</i> and <i>set</i> marks a variable survival of the <i>p</i> and <i>t</i> of the Greek etymon σήπτα, plus contamination with the <i>ccps de vigne.</i> For the cultural background of Greek words in Gascon and Spanish the authoritative study in Walther von Wartburg&rsquo;s paper, &lsquo;Die griechische Kolonisation in Siidgallien und ihre sprachlichen Zeugen im Westromanischen&rsquo;, in <i>Zeitschr. f. rom.

The obstacles to our etymology are two-fold, phonological and cultural. (In Spanish the names of plants are often of Greek origin, but not animals.) But philologists should give full weight to the <i>mana</i> in which all words relating to toads were bathed in the early centuries, and such words, subjected to pressures of <i>tabu,</i> commonly exhibit irregular word-histories. Until the philologists find positive evidence favoring an alternative etymology, they should not close their minds to the semantically felicitous Gr. σάπω. Whether the Basque <i>apo,</i> &lsquo;toad&rsquo;, is borrowed from Spanish or (as Karl Bouda surmised) is related to apxw, the word for &lsquo;frog&rsquo; in the Caucasian language known as Svanetian, need not concern us here.&nbsp;<a href="#cp5b10-r17">&#8617;</a></li>
