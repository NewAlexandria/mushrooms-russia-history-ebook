        </header>

        <section class="main" epub:type="bodymatter chapter">
            <p><span class="initial">T</span>he French word&#160;<i>potiron</i>&#160;means &#8216;pumpkin&#8217;. In the West of France and as far south as the Garonne it also means any large mushroom. The word presents what is perhaps the prettiest problem in the whole fungal vocabulary of Europe. No one has hitherto determined its origin. Littré originally quoted Gilles Ménage&#8217;s suggestion of a word found in the writings of the Arabic thinker Avicenna &#8212;&#8203; &#160;<i>alphotie</i>.&#160;Later in his&#160;<i>Supplément</i>&#160;he added Marcel Devic&#8217;s alternative Arabic source, the word&#160;<i>futr</i>&#160;meaning &#8216;mushroom&#8217;. Oscar Bloch in his turn favored the Syriac <i>pâṭûrṭâ</i>,&#160;which he said meant &#8216;morel&#8217;. These bizarre suggestions with their curious bias for the Near East offer no explanation for&#160;<i>potiron</i>&#160;in the sense of &#8216;pumpkin&#8217;. They only illustrate how even philologists, when at a loss, give recognition to the flimsiest guesses. The Arabic and the Syriac words are etymologically identical, based on a Semitic root meaning &#8216;to split&#8217; or &#8216;to <a name="cleave-1">cleave</a>&#8217;.</p>

            <p>In Latin&#160;<i>cucuma</i>&#160;means a kettle,&#160;<i>cucumis</i>&#160;a cucumber, and&#160;<i>cucurbita</i>&#160;a <a name="gourd-1">gourd</a>. Among primitive communities living in the climatic zone where gourds nourish, these have always served for cooking fluid food and boiling water. This primitive practice must still have been alive in the minds of the ancient Romans when they used words for kettles and gourds that closely resembled each other, and we think that&#160;<i>potiron</i>&#160;is a translation&#160;<i>(pot</i>&#160;meaning &#8216;kettle&#8217;) of the Latin words, preserving for us the semantic link that was obvious in Latin. But this does not explain the use of&#160;<i>potiron</i>&#160;for &#8216;mushroom&#8217;.</p>

            <p>The pumpkin-mushroom link is not confined to&#160;<i>potiron.</i>&#160;We discover it in Provenfal, where&#160;<i>coucourlo</i>&#160;means both the common field mushroom and the pumpkin. The Italian&#160;<i>cocomero</i>&#160;means &#8216;pumpkin&#8217; but not mushroom; the Provençal&#160;<i>cougoumello</i>&#160;is the name of certain mushrooms, but does not mean pumpkin. The general word for all mushrooms in Portuguese is&#160;<i>cogumelo</i>; it is not, however, linked with any gourd. We seem to be in the presence here of a variety of words derived from one or the other of the Latin&#160;<i>cucuma, cucumis</i>, and&#160;<i>cucurbita.</i>&#160;But why are mushrooms found in this company?</p>

            <p>All words such as these, which live out their lives for the most part in oral usage, lend themselves to popular contamination with other words. Some mushrooms when they first break the soil look like eggs, and this is why the amanita cæsarea is called in standard Italian the&#160;<i>ovolo</i>&#160;and the amanita muscaria the&#160;<i>ovolaccio.</i>&#160;The French word&#160;<i>coque</i>&#160;means &#8216;<a name="eggs">eggshell</a>&#8217; and there are colloquial words in Italian,&#160;<i>cocco</i>&#160;and&#160;<i>cucco,</i>&#160;meaning &#8216;egg&#8217;. In standard Italian&#160;<i>cocco</i>&#160;is sometimes used as another name for the amanita cæsarea, and this word takes various local forms in the North: in Piedmont <i>cocon</i> or <i>coc</i> or <i>cucon;</i> in Lombardy, <i>fung cocch</i>; in Venice, the <i>boléo coco</i> or <i>coco bon</i>; in Genoa, the <i>cucun</i>. (Our English &#8216;cocoon&#8217; belongs to the same family.) The names of the amanita muscaria in northern Italy bear the same stamp: <i>cocch fals</i> or <i>cocch velenos,</i> or <i>cocch bastard</i> in Milan. The lepiota procera is the <i>coccomelle</i> or <i>cuccamele</i> in Piedmont; in France this species is called in some regions the <i>coulemelle</i> and in others the <i>potiron</i>. It would appear that all of these names stem ultimately from the Latin word for kettle, but have been influenced in their shape by words for eggs or egg-shells.</p>

            <p>But all this still leaves unexplained why, in the first place, pumpkins and mushrooms got mixed up together.</p>

            <p>Another word for &#8216;pumpkin&#8217; in French is <i>pépon,</i> for which Frédéric Godefroy gives the following early variants: <i>popon</i>, <i>poupon</i>, <i>pompon</i>, <i>ponpon</i>. &#8216;Pumpkin&#8217; in English is a popular form of the Middle English &#8216;pumpion&#8217;, which in turn comes from the French word that we are now discussing. For the sake of our argument and in advance of our supporting evidence, let us assume that the French word <i>pépon</i> originally carried two meanings, &#8216;pumpkin&#8217; and &#8216;mushroom&#8217;. It has retained only one in French, and bequeathed only that one to English. But in Basque <i>papun</i> and <i>panpun</i> mean &#8216;mushroom&#8217;, and could represent the lost meaning of <i>pépon.</i> The French philologists have been baffled by the word <i>pompon</i>, which is the English &#8216;pompom&#8217;, since its semantic tie with gourds is not clear. But the difficulty is solved if the old French word also meant &#8216;mushroom&#8217;, for what is a <i>pompon</i> but a &#8216;mushroom&#8217;?<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b8-fn1" id="cp5b8-r1">[1]</a></sup></p>

            <p>This hypothesis, supported so far by only two strands of circumstantial evidence, still does not tell us why gourds were linked with mushrooms.</p>

            <p>This link is deep-seated, but we believe we can put our finger on it.</p>

            <p>At the outset let us examine the word <i>potiron</i> more closely, and especially its use in the 16<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

            <p>In the sense of &#8216;mushroom&#8217; <i>potiron</i> was in use at least as far back as the 15<sup>th</sup> century, according to Albert Dauzat. This is the older meaning, antedating the discovery of America. <i>Potiron</i> as a designation for gourds is confined to squashes and pumpkins, and they are of New World provenience. In the 16<sup>th</sup> century these vegetables were called <i>courges d&#8217;Inde</i> and <i>courges d&#8217;outre-mer, but potiron</i> began to supersede those nonce names in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. If there was a metaphorical transfer, we must conclude that the New World squash suggested a mushroom to the French and was therefore called a mushroom. This explanation seems to have satisfied the philologists Albert Dauzat and Oscar Bloch, but it leaves us sceptical. To be fair we must point out that there is one small squash with scalloped edges that in color and even in external texture might suggest certain mushrooms. This is the kind of squash, a variety of cucurbita pepo, known formerly as the simlin or cymling and today as the patty pan squash or white bush scallop. A further circumstance might support the philologists&#8217; position. The French were discovering how to cultivate the <i>champignon de couche</i> at the very moment when they were learning to cultivate the squash, in the first half of the 17<sup>th</sup> century, and there is reason to believe that the manured hills of the squash-patch served simultaneously as mushroom beds. For centuries the country folk of some parts of western Europe had been encouraging the growth of various kinds of edible fungi by bringing about the conditions under which they might spontaneously appear. In the 17<sup>th</sup> century it was known in France that parings of the psalliota campestris rejected in the kitchen could be thrown on horse manure with a reasonable expectation that they would produce a crop of mushrooms in the warm fermenting dung.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b8-fn2" id="cp5b8-r2">[2]</a></sup> As we have mentioned before on page 6, N. de Bonnefons described this practice for the first time in print in his <i>Le Jardinier françois</i> in 1651, and he added the significant advice that the beds prepared for melons could serve this double purpose. In our mind&#8217;s eye we can see the mushrooms growing in the same beds or hills with melons, pumpkins, and other gourds, and this was taking place at the very moment when <i>potiron,</i> an old word for &#8216;mushroom&#8217;, was beginning to be used as the name for certain exotic gourds, lately introduced from overseas. It was therefore not unnatural for farmers to associate mushrooms with gourds. Furthermore, the readiness of both squashes and mushrooms to putrefy rather soon into a watery mess<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b8-fn3" id="cp5b8-r3">[3]</a></sup> might have suggested a kinship that expressed itself in the use of the same name for both, a similarity in putrefaction that Sir Thomas Elyot pointed out in 1541 in the words that we quoted on page 19. All in all, the evidence assembled in this paragraph would seem to offer an explanation for the dual use of <i>potiron</i>.</p>

            <p>But let us not forget the suggestion inherent in the older forms of the word <i>pépon</i> indicating that the association of gourds and mushrooms long antedated the 16<sup>th</sup> century and the cultivation of the field mushroom.</p>
            
            <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">T</span>here is a source of promising evidence relevant to our theme of surprising and fascinating quality in the still-life paintings of the Low Countries in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. This was the epoch when the Flemish and Dutch schools were producing innumerable canvases representing the foods of the times &#8212;&#8203; fish, game, meats, vegetables, fruits. The number of accomplished artists who devoted their talents to paintings of food is astonishing, and apparently they never tired of their theme. We have combed these still-lifes for mushrooms, and while of necessity we cover only a small part of the source materials, it is clear that paintings of food with mushrooms are exceedingly rare. We have found only four, of which not one is Dutch. All four are Flemish, or from the Catholic side of the religious line that bisected then as now the Low Countries. On a later page we shall revert to the significant absence of fungi as food from paintings of the Dutch school.</p>

                <p>Of the four paintings we reproduce one by Jan Fyt, and details from a canvas by Jan Davidsz. de Heem and from one by Adriaen van Utrecht. All three of these painters were in the plenitude of their powers at the precise time when N. de Bonnefons was composing his book on gardening and describing for the first time the preparation of mushroom beds. A fourth painting, attributed to the Antwerp artist Frans Snyders, shows a young market woman surrounded by baskets of divers vegetables and fruits with one basket of ceps; it hangs in the art gallery at Schloss Pommersfelden, Germany. Snyders was a slightly older contemporary of the other three. Of this painting a 17<sup>th</sup> century variant is in the Louvre. All four artists worked in Antwerp or Brussels.</p>

                <p>The startling feature of the three paintings that we reproduce is that in all three we find a <i>potiron</i> or squash, and in two the <i>potiron</i> is juxtaposed to mushrooms. In the light of the dual meaning of <i>potiron</i>, this juxtaposition justifies a conjecture that it was not accidental. Thanks to the gracious help of Dr. Hugh C. Cutler, Assistant Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis, we can identify the squashes, and he points out that they are the only vegetables of New World provenience in these paintings. In the Van Utrecht the squash is the cucurbita moschata, and belongs to the variety now called Dickinson Field pumpkin, familiar in the American Southwest and in central and southern Mexico. The squash in the Fyt is probably a cucurbita moschata but might be a pumpkin, i.e., cucurbita pepo. In Heem&#8217;s painting we clearly find the pumpkin. Both squashes and pumpkins may be called <i>potirons</i> in modern French. As for the mushrooms, Snyders, Fyt, and Heem give us ceps; Van Utrecht offers us ceps and three apparently gilled mushrooms. If as we believe these latter are very ripe <i>champignons</i> or <i>rosés</i>, they are the earliest known representation of the common mushroom by an accomplished artist.</p>

                <p>The mute testimony of these paintings is of extraordinary interest. It might seem probable that in the painters&#8217; minds the squash and mushrooms had an affinity for each other, and the squashes in question were certainly of American origin. At the same time the mushrooms painted by them as food were chiefly boleti, and boleti never grew in a pumpkin patch. Clearly the <i>champignon de couche</i> played little or no rôle in the market places of Flanders and Brabant, and the affinity of mushrooms with the squash was unrelated to the mushroom beds described by Bonnefons. The cucurbitaceæ painted by the Flemish artists did not include the patty pan squash, with its superficial resemblance to a mushroom. <i>Potiron</i> in the sense of &#8216;mushroom&#8217; has never been known in the Walloon dialect of French.</p>

                <p>The key to the four Flemish paintings is to be found in Franciscus van Sterbeeck&#8217;s <i>Theatrum Fungorum</i>, published in Antwerp in 1675, the earliest book dealing solely with mushrooms. The author never refers to the still-life painters, who were his older contemporaries, but he divulges a precious item of ethno-mycological lore. He informs us that the Flemings were mycophobes until the beginning of the 17<sup>th</sup> century, at which time certain Italian merchants came to take up residence in Flanders, and by their example they showed that mushrooms could be eaten. They launched a vogue for this novel victual, gathering mushrooms themselves, importing dried ones from Italy and Burgundy, and teaching all and sundry how to distinguish the many good kinds from the bad. In fact, Van Sterbeeck&#8217;s treatise is itself a tribute to this budding mycophilia, written by an enthusiast to spread the good tidings, the first of hundreds of such missionary efforts brought out in the mycophobic North in the past three centuries. As there was no Flemish word to designate mushrooms suitable for the dining room, the Flemings had lately borrowed <i>kampernoeljes</i> from, the French dialect spoken in nearby Picardy<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b8-fn4" id="cp5b8-r4">[4]</a></sup>, and applied it to all the edible kinds, especially ceps. Afterwards it gave way to <i>champignons.</i> We reproduce the frontispiece of Van Sterbeeck&#8217;s work, with its quaint commentary on early mycophagy among the Flemings. The author portrays himself in a bust at the top of the architectural design, helpfully telling us that his age was 44. On one side of him are effigies of happy infants nourished doubtless on the wholesome fungi; on the other side the corresponding amori are in acute distress from the other kind. Below we see two gentlemen responding to aggressive selling tactics of the mushroom vendors. We suspect that the vendors on the right are ready to sell the evil wares descending from the wretched infants above.</p>

                <p>For Van Sterbeeck, for Jan Fyt and his colleagues, mushrooms were a novelty like the squashes from the New World. This must have been one reason for juxtaposing them. Just as the Italians brought mycophagy to Flanders, so they may have been addicted to the new-fangled gourds. Indeed, Italian artists may have suggested to the Flemings the very theme for the paintings that we are discussing. Already in the 16<sup>th</sup> century the Italian painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo was giving eloquent expression to the same idea.</p>

                <p>Arcimboldo was born in 1527 and died in 1593. He delighted in allegorical figures representing the Seasons, the Four Elements, and the cardinal points of the compass, which he would contrive to represent by an ingenious arrangement of fruits, vegetables, meats, animals, fishes, or utensils, his selection harmonizing with his allegory. We reproduce one of his paintings, a reclining figure that embodies the spirit of Autumn. Until a few years ago it belonged to a parish church near Brescia, and it now hangs in the Pinacoteca of that city, not far from Milan. However deficient Arcimboldo was in intellectual and emotional depth, he was an accomplished craftsman, and this painting constitutes a document of singular value for the ethno-botanist. Most of the vegetables and fruits are of Mediterranean provenience, including the medlars of which no fewer than four are present. The egg plant had been lately introduced into Italy from the East. The tuberoses in the figure&#8217;s hair, the squashes, and the maize come from America, the first two from Mexico. The maize is of a Mexican variety also, though it could come from further south.</p>

                <p>Our painting is undated, but perhaps we can fix with reasonable certainty the period of its execution. From 1562 to 1587 Arcimboldo lived in Central Europe, except for a visit to Milan in 1566. Both by its traditional location and by the artist&#8217;s choice of vegetables and fruits, it is clear that the painting was done in Italy. From what we know about the arrival in Italy of the exotic plants that we find in the painting, it is far more likely that the artist worked on it after 1587 than before 1562. This means that it was a product of his last years, between 1587 and his death in 1593. These were the very years when potatoes were becoming known in northern Italy, and their absence from our painting favors an early date within these permissible limits. For the past half century ethno-botanists and cultural historians have been studying the impact on the Old World of the plants discovered in the New, especially tobacco, potatoes, and maize. To document the first phases of these profound innovations they have combed the writings of the explorers and historians, and searched through the 16<sup>th</sup> century herbals. The herbalist Leonhard Fuchs in his <i>De Historia Stirpium</i>, published in 1542, was the first to offer his readers a picture of maize, a woodcut. Thereafter such woodcuts appeared in almost all herbals, often copied not from life but from a preceding herbal, and often deficient botanically. For workers in this field the 16<sup>th</sup> century still-life painters offer an additional source of evidence that seems to have been ignored. We do not know whether our <i>Autumn</i> by Arcimboldo is the earliest still-life with maize, but we submit that his painting of it is incomparably superior to any pictures of maize that have hitherto been pointed out from the 16<sup>th</sup> and even 17<sup>th</sup> centuries. The artist&#8217;s eye was truer than the herbalist&#8217;s, his technique superior to the woodcutter&#8217;s.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b8-fn5" id="cp5b8-r5">[5]</a></sup></p>

                <p>Our own interest in the Arcimboldo lies in his mushrooms. Mycophiles will be delighted with the clavaria that serves the recumbent Autumn for beard and mustachios. In the middle of the left thigh is an <i>ovolo</i> or Cæsar&#8217;s amanita. These are the earliest mushrooms known to us that we can say are well painted, and their like was not to be seen again for a full half century. We now draw our reader&#8217;s attention to the proximity of the squash to the <i>ovolo</i>, and that squash happens to be the very one that, on an earlier page, we likened in texture and shape to mushrooms. It is the squash of American provenience variously called the cymling, the patty pan, and the white bush scallop. What urge prompted the artist to place mushroom and squash together? The scallop was an exotic, but in Italy the edible mushroom was not. Must we fall back on an accidental juxtaposition as our only resort; Or do we discover here an expression, possibly only half conscious on the artist&#8217;s part, of an ancient association of ideas, such as we adumbrated earlier and will shortly pursue further? But before we revert to that theme, we shall conclude our discussion of the mushroom-gourd link in 17<sup>th</sup> century paintings by briefly mentioning another aspect under which mushrooms and gourds were viewed together, the aspect that led Sir Thomas Elyot in 1541 to warn the readers of his <i>Castel of Helth</i> to beware of &#8216;musherons, &#8230; gourds, and al other thinges, whiche wyll sone putrefie&#8217;.</p>

                <p>A favorite theme of some 17<sup>th</sup> century still-life painters in the Low Countries was the transitory nature of all living things, the vanity of this world as contrasted with the eternal values of the next. In a private collection known to us there is a painting by Cornelis de Heem, son of Jan Davidsz. and identified with the Dutch school, in which this <i>vanitas vanitatis</i> chord finds graceful expression. A shaft of light penetrates from an aperture above to a sepulchral setting where a lovely flower arrangement is juxtaposed to a bisected gourd and some growing mushrooms. Unfortunately we have been denied permission to reproduce this extraordinary canvas. The mushrooms are in a shadow and scarcely lend themselves to identification. They are not pictured as food, but instead as the symbol of <a name="decay-4">decay</a> and <a name="death-4">death</a>. From the glory of the flowers in their beauty the eye passes to the doomed segment of the disintegrating melon and on to the fungal expression of the grave. In this painting putrefaction and death are the meanings that underlie both gourd and mushroom.</p>

                <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">I</span>f we are right, there emerged in the 17<sup>th</sup> century new reasons for associating mushrooms and gourds. But the association in men&#8217;s minds was far older. Some indications of this older tradition seem to emerge in the ancient writers. Take for example the work known in English as <i>Etymologies</i> composed by St. Isidore of Seville around A.D. 600. He has occasion to list the vegetables with all their names. Is it by chance that immediately after the cucumbers <i>(cucumeres)</i> and gourds <i>(cucurbitæ)</i> he adds <i>the fungi</i> and <i>tubera</i> or truffles?<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b8-fn6" id="cp5b8-r6">[6]</a></sup> Athenæus in the second book of <i>The Deipnosophists</i> also discusses numerous vegetable foods, and what is our surprise to discover that here also the comments on the mushrooms and truffles follow hard upon the paragraphs dealing with the gourds! It is a commonplace of reference works that the order of the alphabet constantly juxtaposes disparate words and ideas, but the alphabet offers us no explanation for the sequence of vegetables that we find in St. Isidore and Athenæus.</p>
                
                <p>Pliny is yet another witness to the tie that binds mushrooms to gourds. In a sentence in his <i>Historia Naturalis</i> hitherto unremarked by commentators and ignored by the editors of Liddell &amp; Scott&#8217;s Greek lexicon, he tells us, in Book XX, in the chapter that discusses the gourd <i>(cucurbita),</i> about a wild gourd, hollow, on which he says the Greeks have bestowed the name <i>spongos,</i> a gourd growing only on stony soil, of which the walls are of the thickness of a finger, which when chewed yields a juice wholesome for the stomach.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b8-fn7" id="cp5b8-r7">[7]</a></sup> Here then in ancient times is a wild gourd that shares with sponges and mushrooms a name belonging to the cluster of basic words for the fungal tribe. The dual function of <i>potiron</i> in the 17<sup>th</sup> century was a revival and not an innovation, and we believe that in the root of the Latin word <i>pepo</i> we shall find mushrooms and gourds conjoined.</p>
                
                <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">T</span>hroughout the Slavic lands there is a distinctive name for the common field mushroom. It takes various forms, but in the Ukraine it is <i>pecheritza</i>, and <i>pecharka</i> may be taken as a typical variant in other Slavic countries. The uniformity of this name throughout the Slavic world and its invariable application to the common field mushroom are remarkable evidences of its antiquity: it must antedate the dispersion of the Slavs and the differentiation in Slavic languages. The Lithuanians do not use the word, nor do the Germanic peoples; but the Jews of Eastern Europe have adopted it in Yiddish, and refer to a girl dressed up &#8216;like a <i>pecheritza&#8217;</i>, as an American might say, &#8216;like a Christmas tree&#8217;. With a transposition of consonants, the word has been taken into both Rumanian, <i>ciupercă,</i> and Magyar, <i>csöpörke.</i> Its derivation has never been clear. Some have suggested that it came <i>frompechora</i>, meaning a cave, since the psalliota campestris lends itself to cultivation in cellars and caves. But this is unacceptable, for the wild field mushroom does not grow in caves and its artificial cultivation began in France only after the year 1700. Others have suggested a derivation from <i>pech&#8217;,</i> meaning oven, and gone on to assume that the <i>pecheritza</i> was normally roasted. This is hardly satisfying, for the field mushroom lends itself to roasting no better than other kinds, and furthermore in the whole rich mushroom vocabulary of Europe there is no other name derived from a method of culinary preparation.</p>

                <p>But let us take another look at that Slavic word <i>pech&#8217;</i>, &#8216;oven&#8217;. It is cognate with the Greek πέπων, the Latin <i>pepo</i>, whence through the French <i>pépon</i> to the English &#8216;pumpion&#8217;. These are all of ancient and well attested lineage, coming down to us from an Indo-European root that the French philologists Ernout and Meillet reconstruct as pek<sup>w</sup>o, which became k<sup>w</sup>ek<sup>w</sup>o in the Italian peninsula and in Celtic. The Latin <i>coquo</i>, meaning to cook, and all its kin and progeny are of this family. Whether <i>cucuma</i> and <i>cucumis</i> belong here, we do not know, but even if they do not, a semantic blend is possible, for cookery is the common denominator of them all. Baking and roasting and cooking are the ideas that underlie the root. That which is baked rises, expands, swells, grows brown and ripe and mature. It is therefore not surprising to discover that from the earliest times the word carried a second related meaning, the idea of &#8216;ripening in the sun&#8217;. As Ernout and Meillet say, &#8220;La notion de &#8216;maturité&#8217; est liée à la racine depuis l&#8217;indo-européen.&#8221; Whence the application to gourds, and &#8212;&#8203; we submit &#8212;&#8203; to that species of mushroom, the psalliota campestris, which comes to maturity in the open fields under the sun. Pumpkins and these mushrooms swell and ripen in the sun. The Provençal <i>concourlo</i>, meaning both field mushroom and pumpkin, is a breath-taking word, for in its specific application to the field mushroom we witness the toughness of a semantic theme running through long stretches of time and space.</p>

                <p>If our argument prove sound, we have established from evidence gathered in Eastern Europe the explanation for the link between mushrooms and gourds that crops out in the French <i>potiron</i> and in the Provençal <i>coucourlo</i>. Just as we have earlier established what we call a <i>pogge</i> cluster of mushroom words, and a sponge cluster, so now we discover the existence of a gourd cluster. All three appear to go back to Indo-European roots that resemble each other and that convey the same innermost idea of a growth or swelling. But only the first of these clusters directly involves the frogs and toads. In the French word <i>potiron</i>, wherein mushrooms are called pots, metaphorically speaking, the attentive mind catches a recurrence of the semantic theme that we found in the Indo-Aryan languages, where a Sanskrit word for &#8216;pot&#8217; or jar&#8217; has fathered numerous progeny among the fungal words of various languages, the theme of the gourd, the swelling organism.</p>

                <p class="sub-chapter"><span class="initial-small">H</span>ere we might end this section, were it not that in the Basque language we discover an amazing thing. In the Labourdin dialect of Basque the name of the common field mushroom is <i>paratxiko</i>, the <i>-tx-</i> in Basque being pronounced like &#8216;ch&#8217; in &#8216;cheek&#8217;. By a transposition of consonants we arrive at the Slavic <i>pecharka,</i> with identical meaning! This is not all. In various parts of Europe there has always been a tendency for the name of the best known species of mushroom to be used as a word for mushrooms generally. If, as seems likely, the general word used for mushrooms in Basque, <i>perretxiko</i>, is a variant of <i>paratxiko</i>, this would indicate that when the Basques acquired the word, the field mushroom was for them the dominant species. It is clear that these words cannot be native to the Basque language, for no native words begin with the letter p. In Catalonia <i>paratge</i> circulates as a mushroom name, but its specific application seems to be variable; we suggest that this Catalan word was borrowed from Basque. How then does it come about that the Basques use a word that seems to lend itself to identification with a Slavic term?</p>

                <p>After pondering this curious question for some time, it occurred to us that the Gypsies could have borrowed the Slavic word and then, in the course of their wanderings, delivered it to the Basques. There are numerous lexicons of the various dialects of Romany, but none of them seem to have been composed by scholars interested in mushrooms. In the end we addressed a blind inquiry to that specialist in all matters pertaining to Gypsies, the Irish scholar Walter Starkie, whose experience with the Gypsies goes back over forty years. The reader will imagine our surprise and pleasure when we learned for the first time from Dr. Starkie&#8217;s reply that the Gypsies are great lovers of all kinds of edible mushrooms, and that one mushroom name used by the Spanish Gypsies is <i>perrechites</i>!</p>

                <p>This is not of course a conclusive explanation of the Basque word. We should learn more about that Gypsy term &#8212;&#8203; over how much of Europe the Gypsies use it, and what variations it manifests. The fact that the Gypsies are mycophiles is important. If the fruits of recent scholarship are sound, the Basques are linguistically related to the Caucasian peoples, and all the Caucasian peoples are mycophobes; this is true at least of the Georgians, Mingrelians, and Svanetians, and of the Circassians and Ossetians and Chechens, among whom we have had an opportunity to locate informants. The mushroom vocabulary of the Basques is reasonably rich, but consists mostly of borrowed or translated words, as though they too had once been mycophobes. The Basque country has long been a habitat for Gypsies. A people like the Basques not steeped in mycophagy is unlikely to bestow on the mycophilic Gypsies an important word for mushrooms, and perhaps least of all a word that is itself a loan word in Basque. On the other hand, mycophilic sojourners in the Pyrenees might have given to the Basques some lessons in mycophagy. Our hypothesis, after we formulated it, has received startling collateral support in an observation volunteered to us by a Swedish friend, the banker <span id="ahren">Frithiof Ahrén</span>. &#8220;I have been told&#8221;, said he, &#8220;that the Gypsies taught us in Sweden to eat mushrooms, in times when food was scarce.&#8221;</p>

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b8-fn1">In the United States and Canada, the ordinary woodsman&#8217;s word for any shelf fungus is &#8216;conk&#8217;, and because of the shape of the growth, the word is supposed to come from &#8216;conch&#8217;. But woodsmen do not know the molluscs and are unlikely to turn to them for metaphors. The <i>Dictionary of American English</i> gives grounds for supposing that &#8216;conk&#8217; is a shortened form of &#8216;conkus&#8217; or &#8216;konkus&#8217;. In the English counties from Lincolnshire to the Scottish border there has long been a word used for cucumbers: &#8216;congers&#8217;, &#8216;cungers&#8217;, and &#8216;conkers&#8217;. Is the American word for the fungus cognate with the name for the cucumber, and do we find here another example of the association of fungi with gourds? In the absence of a bettter etymology, we offer this as a conjecture, to be tested by further inquiry.&#160;<a href="#cp5b8-r1">&#8617;</a></li>
                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b8-fn2">The use of fungal &#8216;spawn&#8217; came later, as did the discovery that mushrooms lent themselves to cultivation in caves and cellars. But there is a baffling sentence in the <i>Satyricon</i> of Petronius Arbiter, written in the first century: Ecce intra hos dies scripsit, ut illi ex India semen boletorum mitteretur. [Loeb Library, p. 59] Within a few days, I may say, he has written for a cargo of mushroom seed from India. <i>If boletus</i> here carries its usual meaning of the Caesar&#8217;s amanita, it indicates a mastery in the cultivation of these delectable mushrooms wholly unknown today and never elsewhere mentioned in surviving records of ancient times.&#160;<a href="#cp5b8-r2">&#8617;</a></li>

The pea pod played a familiar role in amatory folklore in Shakespere&#8217;s day, and &#8216;peascod&#8217; was heavily charged with genito-urinary puns and symbols; cf. &#8216;cod&#8217;, &#8216;codpiece&#8217;, etc. Mistress &#8216;Squash&#8217; invokes a parallel female metaphor equivalent to Shakespere&#8217;s erotic use of &#8216;medlar&#8217; in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and elsewhere. Though &#8216;cod&#8217;, as we have seen, sometimes meant &#8216;puffbair, in Bottom&#8217;s words there is no link with the fungalp world or gourds.&#160;<a href="#cp5b8-r3">&#8617;</a></li>
