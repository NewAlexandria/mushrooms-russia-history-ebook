  THE 'POGGE' CLUSTER</h2>

    <p class="calibre1"><span class="initial">J</span>ust as we turned to the Breton word&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tousec</i>&nbsp;for a clue to the inner meaning of 'toadstool', so now we invite our readers to look with us at the Low German&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">word&nbsp;</span><i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">pogge,</i><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">&nbsp;meaning frog or toad, and&nbsp;</span><i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;"><b class="calibre5">poggenstohl,</b></i><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">&nbsp;'frogstool'.&nbsp;</span><i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">Pogge</i><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">&nbsp;exists in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">many a dialectical variant:&nbsp;</span><i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">pogg, pagg, pugg, puck, pook, pauk, poch,</i><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">puch.</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1">One of the daring labors of modern philologists has been the reconstruction</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of the original Indo-European roots that lie behind our modern vocabularies.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">With the known vocabularies of some scores of languages, living and dead,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to go by, they work back along converging lines of evolution to discover,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">as closely as the evidence permits, the roots that were current perhaps four</p>

    <p class="calibre1">thousand years ago, before the linguistic unity of our ancestors broke up.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">These reconstructed roots cannot of course be tested against actual usage, nor</p>

    <p class="calibre1">is it remotely possible to document the history of their verbal progeny back</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to them in a way that would constitute proof by the exacting standards of the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">etymological discipline. It is also true that different philologists working from</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the same evidence arrive sometimes at different reconstructions of the root,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">but often there is a consensus, and even if we consider the results only tentative</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and approximate, these hypothetical Indo-European roots serve, if cautiously</p>

    <p class="calibre1">used, to associate together significantly large clusters of words. The philologist of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">our time who has devoted his life to this work is Julius Pokorny. In his latest</p>

    <p class="calibre1">revision of his&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">IndogermanischesEtymologischesWorterbuch</i>&nbsp;he presents an important</p>

    <p class="calibre1">root that he represents thus: b(e)u-, bh(e)u-. It means to swell up, to puff up,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to fill with wind, to inflate or expand or distend, and in origin it is imitative.1</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Among the many words that Pokorny traces to this root is our Low German</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pogge,</i>&nbsp;meaning frog or toad, and the semantic link here is clear. Of the aspects</p>

    <p class="calibre1">that the frog or toad presents to the human senses, two stand out, one aural</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and the other visual: the croak, and the astonishing distension of the creature</p>

    <p class="calibre1">with air in the act of croaking. A frog or toad suggests the idea of a sac that</p>

    <p class="calibre1">lends itself to gaseous distension. From Pokorny's root we derive also our</p>

    <p class="calibre1">English 'poke', meaning a bag, and 'pocket', and the French&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">poche.</i>&nbsp;To the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">same family belongs the Anglo-Saxon&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">buc,</i>&nbsp;meaning 'belly' and also any bellied</p>

    <p class="calibre1">container such as a pitcher. To these we would venture to add a curious trio of</p>

    <p class="calibre1">English words, the obsolete 'pung' and 'bung' and the Scottish 'spung', all three</p>

    <p class="calibre1">meaning 'purse', words that picked up somewhere along the road a nasal infix,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">I. Pokorny offers two additional, somewhat similar roots conveying the same meanings: (i) baxb-, bhaxbh-,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">paxp-; and (2) baxmb-, bhaxmbh-, paxmp-, phaxmph. See first two fascicles of his revision, published in Bern in</p>

    <p class="calibre1">1949. The possible kinships between these three roots need not concern us.</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

    <p class="calibre1">as the philologists say. In Swedish&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pung,</i>&nbsp;meaning 'pouch', is in current use.1</p>

    <p class="calibre1">There exists, we believe, abundant evidence that latent&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">inpogge</i>&nbsp;is the metaphor</p>

    <p class="calibre1">of an inflatable sac. In the eastern part of the Dutch province of Gelderland,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">the same word&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pogge</i>&nbsp;means, not a frog, but a young pig, a creature notorious</p>

    <p class="calibre1">for its fat rotundity.2 The same figure of speech underlies the words for 'toad' in</p>

    <p class="calibre1">other languages. Thus&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bufo</i>&nbsp;in Latin suggests the blown-up cheeks of the buffoon.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">In ancient Greek a kind of toad that was said to puff itself up to bursting and to</p>

    <p class="calibre1">exhale a poisonous breath was the cpuaaXoc, a word derived from cpDasc, meaning</p>

    <p class="calibre1">a bellows, a wind, a blast, a breath; and it is related to a Greek word for bladder</p>

    <p class="calibre1">and bubble. In the Tosk dialect of Albanian, a toad is a&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">thithelope,</i>&nbsp;or 'cow's</p>

    <p class="calibre1">udder',&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">thithe-</i>&nbsp;being the udder. The inflated pouch of a toad suggests an udder.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Now we turn to the Irish language, and here our wild fungi re-enter the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">scene in a strange blending of metaphors already familiar to us. In Irish there</p>

    <p class="calibre1">are two words for a bag or pouch,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bolg,</i>&nbsp;which is related to the Latin&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bulga,</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1">and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">puca,</i>&nbsp;which was probably borrowed between A.D. 800 and 1050 from</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Scandinavian sources. They are two further examples of words belonging</p>

    <p class="calibre1">to the family of our familiar Pokorny root. In Irish one way to refer to a wild</p>

    <p class="calibre1">fungus is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bolg losgainn,</i>&nbsp;literally 'frog's pouch', and another&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">wayis pucan beireach,</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1">'heifer's pouch'. If the 'heifer's pouch' refers to the udder, as we suppose, the</p>

    <p class="calibre1">same figure of speech that in Albanian means 'toad' turns up in Irish meaning</p>

    <p class="calibre1">'toadstool'. In Irish,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bolg seidte,</i>&nbsp;'blown-up bag', is a term for the puffball. It</p>

    <p class="calibre1">is easy to see why the fungi figure in all these metaphors: puff balls, toadstools,</p>

    <p class="calibre1">all the wild fungi of forest and field, impress the visual sense as creatures that</p>

    <p class="calibre1">quickly swell up.3 Francis Bacon in his&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Sylva Sylvamtn</i>&nbsp;described the puffball</p>

    <p class="calibre1">as a 'cod, or bag'; in Bacon's time 'cod' meant both 'pouch' and 'scrotum'.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">In Latin&nbsp;<i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">bulga</b></i>&nbsp;was a humorous metaphor for the womb, and the bagpipe down</p>

    <p class="calibre1">through Renaissance times was a symbol of lust and wantonness.4 In Slavic our</p>

    <p class="calibre1">Pokorny root erupts directly in to the fungal vocabulary. An</p>

    <p class="calibre1">1. High German&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Pocke,</i>&nbsp;English 'pock' and 'pox', the erupting pustule, belong to the same verbal family. It</p>

    <p class="calibre1">has been suggested that Low German&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pogge</i>&nbsp;means the 'pock-marked one", rather than the 'bag'. But this is</p>

    <p class="calibre1">belied, as we shall see, by the metaphors latent in other languages and dialects. Furthermore, the principal mean</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ing&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">of pogge</i>&nbsp;is 'frog', and the common frogs of Central Europe, unlike toads, are free of warts and pustules.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">The usual words for 'toad' in Low German are&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">padde</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">utze.</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1">2. For this information we are indebted to Professor G. G. Kloeke, of Leiden, who refers us to his&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Taalatlas</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">van Noord- en Zuid-Nederland,</i>&nbsp;Lief, n, 1, in the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">'Ferkel'</i>&nbsp;chart.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">3. For hobgoblin there are words in Manx,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">boag, boagdne,</i>&nbsp;and in Irish,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bocdn,</i>&nbsp;that seem to belong to the same</p>

    <p class="calibre1">family, though the kinship is obscure. They recall a cluster of Irish words for mushrooms -&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">beac</i>&nbsp;and its dimi</p>

    <p class="calibre1">nutives&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">biocdn</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">beacdn.</i>&nbsp;Perhaps Irish scholars will tell us whether these fungal words do not also harbor</p>

    <p class="calibre1">ideas of sprites and of bellies, and thus link them with our&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pogge-duster.</i>&nbsp;There is an Irish term,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">beacdn bearaigh,</i></p>

    <p class="calibre1">which on its face would seem to mean 'heifer's mushroom', but underneath the surface is it not analogous to</p>

    <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pucdn beireach,</i>&nbsp;'heifer's pouch', and parallel in meaning ?</p>

    <p class="calibre1">4. For a discussion of the erotic associations of the bagpipe as found in art and literature, see Edward A. Block's</p>

    <p class="calibre1">'Chaucer's Millers and Their Bagpipes',&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Speculum,</i>&nbsp;April 1954, pp. 239 ff.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">93</p>
  </div>

  <p class="calibre1">ancient word for 'mushroom' survives in the Czech <i class="calibre4">bedla,</i> in the Polish <i class="calibre4">bedla,</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in <i class="calibre4">bhtza,</i> a term reported in certain parts of Russia. From these words Roman</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jakobson reconstructs the hypothetical <i class="calibre4">bii-dla</i> for primitive Slavic, descended in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">its turn from our Indo-European root, with the addition of the Slavic instru-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mental suffix <i class="calibre4">-dl-.</i> The philologists link these Slavic words with an Indie word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning 'bubble', wherein the idea of the swelling sac recurs in purest form.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vv e have pursued our Low German <i class="calibre4">pogge</i> on the humble and earthy level</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of toads and frogs, udders, bags, and fungi. But the underlying metaphor,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">keyed to gaseous distension and gaseous collapse, lends itself to images on a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wholly different plane, and our same Indo-European root proliferated verbal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">progeny in the incorporeal world, the world of imps, sprites, and goblins.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here we find our 'spooks', and Shakespere's Puck, and Kipling's <i class="calibre4">'Puck</i> of</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Pook's</i> Hill', malicious forces of the unseen world, unaccountable, like Hamlet's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ghost <i class="calibre4">hie et ubique,</i> the bugbears and bugaboos of cowering minds. In Irish,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">puca</i> circulates as two distinct words, meaning 'bag' and 'sprite', though in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our opinion they are etymologically and metaphorically identical. The Pooka</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Mary Chase's play <i class="calibre4">Harvey</i> is a wise but mischievous spirit, an imaginary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rabbit blown up to more than human size. In English 'puck' refers only to imps,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but here, as in Irish, we find it associated with the fungal world, for 'puckfist',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">now fallen into disuse, was once a common name for the puff ball. The second</p>

  <p class="calibre1">element in the word, '-fist', meant a silent expulsion of hind wind, and so a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">puffball was an imp's flatus. In Russian a 'flatus' is a <i class="calibre4">puk,</i> riming with juke',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the word is another of our <i class="calibre4">pogge</i> cluster intimately linked with a family</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Russian words relating to gaseous distension, swelling, bursting, ripping open;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but the Russian word is not associated with fungi or amphibians.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Like the weaver's threads shuttling in and out in warp and woof, we have seen</p>

  <p class="calibre1">how words and meanings play hide-and-seek: frogs and toads are inflatable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sacs, and these are sprites, and bags and sprites are fungi. Today the meanings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are compartmented, their latent metaphors forgotten. But there was a time</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when the metaphors were living, the words fluid. We have said that 'puckfist',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">referring to a puffball, meant an imp's flatus. Did it once, long ago, mean</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'toad's flatus'? There is no evidence in surviving English documents for this.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yet we know that the toad was the habitation of the Evil One. We know</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that in the southwest of England toadstools to this day are called 'pixie-stools',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with a puckish pixie thus doing service for the toad.1 We know more: the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. Richard C. A. Prior pointed this out close to a century ago in his <i class="calibre4">On the Popular Names of British Plants,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">London. He also suggested an etymological tie between 'puck' and <i class="calibre4">pogge.</i> See entries under 'pixie-stool', 'puck-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fist', and 'toadstool'. We consulted the edition of 1879.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">language closest to English is Frisian, and in the dialect of Frisian spoken on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the island of Terschelling the puff ball is called the <i class="calibre4">podde-fyst,</i> toad's flatus, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the neighboring island of Schiermonnikoog it is the <i class="calibre4">pare-puster,</i> toad's puff.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But the association with imps is also not absent from Frisian, for in the town</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Dokkum the puffball is called the <i class="calibre4">spoekebal,</i> or 'spookball'. With what</p>

  <p class="calibre1">regularity the semantic themes recur! In German we face a pretty problem:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the puffball is <i class="calibre4">theBovist</i> or <i class="calibre4">Bofist,</i> and in Low German we <i class="calibre4">fmdpofist:</i> the second</p>

  <p class="calibre1">syllable in these words is clear, but what idea hides behind the first syllable?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">No one knows, but we think it is safe to assume that it meant either frog or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toad, or an imp, or a sac, or a puff, or a blending of these. And whichever it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was, behind it lay the primal idea of a gaseous swelling, an exhalation; and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">emotionally, all of these terms connoted something vile.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the first stage of our 'toadstool' pilgrimage, we identified what we call</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the poison-cluster of toad and fungal words. Now we have gone on to identify</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4">pogge-cluster,</i> wherein, through the mediation of the evil spirit with which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">both toads and fungi were felt to be instinct, we find these lowly creatures</p>

  <p class="calibre1">linked together verbally in the untutored minds of early men inhabiting the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dank forests of northern Europe from Ireland to Russia. Here we discern the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">deep folk associations that caused and expressed the mycophobia of the Celtic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Germanic peoples. In the Mediterranean world, a kindred idea of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">breath, the exhalation, gave rise to metaphors of the loftiest associations -</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Holy 'Spirit' and Divine Imp/ration. In Russia the word for the soul -</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">dushd -</i> flows from <i class="calibre4">dukh,</i> the word for breath. But by an initial turning in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wrong direction, the metaphorical use of gaseous distension and exhalation in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the world north of the Alps reduced the Holy Spirit to a sprite, and the Divine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Afflatus into an imp's flatus. The northern metaphor was keyed to frogs and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toads, and they to swollen fungi, and both to the Devil.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Earlier we saw how toads and fungi and venom executed a kind of triangular</p>

  <p class="calibre1">measure in the minds and words of the peoples who dwelt on the shores of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the North Sea. Against the vaster background of a still more ancient world,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we have seen how a common idea underlay the words for things as disparate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as toads, sacs, fungi, and imps, and how meanings and metaphors criss-crossed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the figures of an antique quadrille. The poison-cluster of words was super-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">imposed, so to speak on the <i class="calibre4">pogge-cluster:.</i> In France the toad and the Devil</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coalesce, with fungi joining the company.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have seen that an Irish expression for the mushroom is the frog's pouch,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">bolg <b class="calibre5">losgainn.</b> Bolg</i> is cousin to the English words 'belly', 'bulge', and 'bilge'.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;"><br /></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">I. The Irish chronicles refer to the aborigines of Ireland as the</span> <i class="calibre4" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">Fir Bolg,</i> <span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">'pouch men", of which the meaning is</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">('Bilge' is the ship's belly where bilge-water collects.)&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Bolg</i>&nbsp;also means belly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or womb, bag or pouch or pocket, bellows, bladder, pimple, blister. It is kin</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the Latin&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bulga,</i>&nbsp;which meant a leathern pouch or reticule (in lieu of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pockets that the Romans did not have) carried over the forearm, a word that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the second century lexicographer Festus traced to an origin in Gaul. It is the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same word as the French&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bouge,</i>&nbsp;which has had a succession of meanings down</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the centuries - a concavity, a dump, a miserable habitation, the belly of a cask,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a leathern bag, a valise. Another word of the same clan is 'budget', that most</p>

  <p class="calibre1">distended of all wallets, always 'bulging'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If, as we have seen, frogs and toads were often called 'pouches' or 'bags', then</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by a reverse semantic transfer, we might discover that on occasions some word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for 'toad' that had no semantic or etymological kinship with the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pogge-clustei:</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">might be used for a pouch or wallet. The word for pocket in High German</p>

  <p class="calibre1">today is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Tasche,</i>&nbsp;and we can trace it back to Old High German&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tasca,</i>&nbsp;where the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">trail is lost. The Italian&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tasca</i>&nbsp;means a pouch or wallet. Some have considered</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Italian word distinct from the German, but no satisfactory etymology</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has been found for it either. We now put to the philologists the question whether</p>

  <p class="calibre1">both the German and the Italian words are not simply our old friend&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tosca,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Anglo-Saxon word for toad. We are not obliged to assume that&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tosca</i>&nbsp;or</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tasca</i>&nbsp;in the sense of toad was ever current in Old High German: it could have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been borrowed in the Old High German period (not earlier than about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A.D. 800) from some other area where&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tasca,</i>&nbsp;meaning toad, had already taken</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on as a second meaning the sense of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bulga</i>&nbsp;or wallet. Nor was it borrowed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">necessarily from Anglo-Saxon, of course, since the area where this word circu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lated in various forms was much more extensive; just how extensive we do</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not know. There could have been, for a time, a style of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bulga -</i>&nbsp;a leathern scrip</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hanging from the forearm - designed to imitate a toad, and a term that began</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as a nonce-word could have struck permanent root in Germany and Italy.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">obscure.&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Bolg</i>&nbsp;here may be related to&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bog,</i>&nbsp;an Irish word meaning 'soft', and to the Irish words&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">began</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">bogac,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">'bog', 'quagmire'. Cf. the undoubted etymological kinship between German&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Schwamm,</i>&nbsp;'mushroom', and Eng-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. The presence of a in both the Italian and Old High German words reminds us of the Anglo-Saxon variant</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">taxe</i>&nbsp;(see p. 75, footnote), and lends weight to Victor Henry's suggestion that confusion arose in Latin between</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">toxicum</i>&nbsp;on the one hand and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">taxus, taxicus</i>&nbsp;on the other. Our suggested etymology might be valid for Italian&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tasca</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">even if invalid for the Old High German word. This brings us to an obstacle in the way of our theory that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">philologists will quickly bring up. The authorities cite an Old Saxon word&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">dasga</i>&nbsp;meaning 'pocket'. This would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">correspond by normal transition to Old High German&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">tasca,</i>&nbsp;and the pair of words would point to a purely</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Teutonic root. But the Old Saxon word appears, not in a text, but in a gloss; see J. H. Gallee's&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Altsachsische</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Sprachdenkmaler,</i>&nbsp;p. 287, 11. 26-27. The source is there given as a Karlsruhe ms. that is not further identified.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">An exhaustive examination of all the evidence supporting the existence of Old Saxon&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">dasga</i>&nbsp;needs to be made.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The gloss may reflect a false back-formation from the Old High German word, a pedant's error; or it could</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be a copyist's misreading. In addition to the doubtful Old Saxon form&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">dasga,</i>&nbsp;there are various citations of an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Old High German form&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">dasga.</i></p>
