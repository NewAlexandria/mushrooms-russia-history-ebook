  <p class="calibre1">Mushrooms are rare in art. In the Christian world they appear first and chiefly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as illustrations for mycological texts, primarily utilitarian in purpose. Today</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our mycological illustrations approach perfection in some of the slick color</p>

  <p class="calibre1">engravings of modern mushroom manuals. Henri Fabre's water colors might</p>

  <p class="calibre1">also fall under this heading. But Fabre succeeded in doing more than merely</p>

  <p class="calibre1">catch the details significant for the student of mushrooms. He perceived and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">caught with his brush the eerie strangeness of these diverse creatures, he caught</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their grace and mystery, and in his finest compositions he far transcended the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">humble functions of the faithful illustrator.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the earliest illustrations of mushrooms there was a singular unevenness of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quality. Already in Plate XXXII we have shown how excellently a miniaturist in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the zoth century represented the truffle, and how absurd was the first printed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">representation of that same truffle (fig. 10), published in Mainz in 1491. On Plate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">XXII we reproduced from the same loth century Codex the illustration of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fomes officinalis, and in contrast with the excellence of the truffle, the miniaturist</p>

  <p class="calibre1">here indulged in a startling aberration based on a popular notion that this shelf</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungus possessed sexuality of a quasi-human kind. On the other hand, in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Hortus Sanitatis</i> where the ill-begotten truffle appeared, the fomes officinalis</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was rather well portrayed, growing correctly on the trunk of a larch.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The successive scribes who copied the manuscript of Dioscorides seem to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have followed various traditions in their illustrations, imitating the predecessor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whose work lay before them. The earliest mushroom miniature known to us is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Qth century codex of Dioscorides now lying in the Bibliotheque Nationale.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There the mushrooms look like balloons or cherries or gooseberries. In the same</p>

  <p class="calibre1">library there is an nth century (or slightly later) Arabic manuscript of Diosco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rides, and it is clear that here the miniaturist was working in the same uninspired</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tradition, if indeed he was not copying from the 9th century manuscript directly.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Freer Gallery in Washington possesses a page from yet another Arabic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">version, this one written in the year 1224, and here the same globular forms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have degenerated far indeed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the other hand, in the Morgan loth century codex there appear three</p>

  <p class="calibre1">capped mushrooms of superior lineage, and we permit ourselves to believe</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. In our quest for early mushroom miniatures we have concentrated on mss. of Dioscorides. There are other</p>

  <p class="calibre1">promising possibilities that we have not explored, i.e., the mss. of Theophrastus, Nikander, Athenaeus, Galen,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pliny, and St. Isidore.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Fig. 26.</i>&nbsp;Illustration from Matthiolus' Commentaries&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">on Dioscorides, Paris 1578.</span></p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_67"><br /></h2>

  <p class="calibre1">that they originated with the same artist who depicted the truffle. How exciting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it would be to discover who he was and when he lived, the original begetter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of this truffle and these mushrooms! Was he perhaps Dioscorides himself, or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that mysterious master whom Dioscorides revered - Cratevas, attendant at the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Court of Mithridates Eupator a century before Christ ? Except in the various</p>

  <p class="calibre1">recensions of Dioscorides, we have found mushrooms in only one medieval</p>

  <p class="calibre1">manuscript, the illuminated initial in Aldobrandino da Siena's <i class="calibre4">Le Livre pour la</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Sante du Corps.</i> And here we discover for the first time a sense of composition.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Six of the mushrooms in this initial might stem back to the illustrations in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Morgan Dioscorides, but boldly rising above them is a good representation of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a craterellus. We reproduce on Plate LVI this illuminated initial from the Aldo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">brandino manuscript in the Morgan collection, written probably in Rouen</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about the year 1450, but copied perhaps from earlier versions going back a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century or two.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With the <i class="calibre4">Hortus Sanitatis</i> in 1491, the tradition of the printed illustration of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms began. In the 1550'$ the Italian Pietro Andrea Mattioli brought out</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his <i class="calibre4">Commentaries</i> on Dioscorides, and this important book quickly passed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">through many editions. From the French version published in Lyons in 1578</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we reproduce the woodcut accompanying the chapter on mushrooms. Here</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the first time we discover mushrooms in their habitat, growing around a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stump, with snakes about and 'flies' in the air. The illustrator was doing his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">best to cope with his text and for the first time mushrooms were being portrayed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">against their natural background, as it was then conceived.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">Europe's storehouse of art is primarily religious in inspiration, and the religious</span><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">art of Europe ignores the whole fungal world. This is not surprising, for mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms are not mentioned in the Bible1 nor in the Apocrypha nor in the writings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Early Church Fathers. Unless we make an exception for the Czech folk</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tale that we recounted in Volume I, mushrooms seem never to figure in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hagiographical legends. The deplorable truth must be faced: the Christian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">religion has no mushrooms in it anywhere. True, four Saints speak of them,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but of these, three were scholars writing on natural history.2 This leaves the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fourth, and let us turn to what that great man had to say.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have seen on an earlier page in what low esteem the Protestant divine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jeremy Taylor held mushrooms. Only a few decades before Taylor's disparaging</p>

  <p class="calibre1">remarks, St. Francis of Sales in Geneva was giving vent to kindred emotions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in that extraordinary classic of Catholic piety, the <i class="calibre4">Introduction to the Devout</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Life.</i> St. Francis and the Protestant clergyman speak from the identical myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phobic tradition, and undoubtedly in the case of these moralists the vogue in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their day of certain fungi as aphrodisiacs reinforced their natural feelings. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Chapter 33 of Part 3 of St. Francis's book, he turns his attention to 'balls, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other permissible but dangerous pastimes', and then he goes on:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I say to you about dances, Philotee, what the doctors say about <i class="calibre4">potirons</i> and <i class="calibre4">champi-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">gnons,</i> the best are worthless. . . If nevertheless you must eat mushrooms, see to it that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they are well prepared. If for some reason you cannot get out of going to a dance, see</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to it that your dancing is well considered . . . Eat few mushrooms and eat them seldom,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">say the doctors, for no matter how well prepared they are, in quantity they are venomous.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dance little and seldom, Philotee, for otherwise you expose yourself to the danger of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">becoming addicted thereto. According to Pliny, mushrooms being spongy and porous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">easily draw to themselves any infection in the neighborhood, so that when near serpents</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they draw to themselves the serpents' venom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Similarly, continues St. Francis, dances attract vice and sin. And just as after</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms it is wise to drink precious wine as an antitoxin, so after dances one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should concentrate on holy thoughts.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">With mushrooms virtually ignored in Christian writings, it is not surprising</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that they hardly figure in the mighty river of traditional European art. When</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. In Leviticus xrv: 34-53, there is a description of a 'plague of leprosy in a house' and some mycologists have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seen in it a visitation of the fungus known as the merulius lacrymans. The difficulty with this conjecture is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the house in question was constructed primarily of stone and mortar, as the text itself makes clear, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stone and mortar were infected. The merulius lacrymans attacks timber.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. St. Isidore of Seville, St. Hildegard, and Albertus Magnus. St. Hildegard was a German nun who in the nth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century composed a medical work entitled <i class="calibre4">Liber Subtilitatutn Diversarum Naturarum Creaturarum.</i> In Book i,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'De Plantis', she described the physiological effects (as she understood them) of the kinds of fungi that grow</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the different species of trees. See J. P. Migne: <i class="calibre4">Patrologics,</i> vol. 197, col. 1194.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;"><br /></span></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">once we leave aside the illustrations to mycological texts and turn to the main</span><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">corpus of European painting, they are almost wholly absent until the idth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century. We have already discussed on pages 87 ff. the effigy of a Satanic boletus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Bosch's Hay Wain. This is the earliest mushroom known to us by an Old</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Master.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The second is in the same tradition, by a Fleming who was surely a myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phobe, Peter Brueghel the Elder. In his allegorical painting <i class="calibre4">The Misanthrope,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">dated 1568 and now hanging in the Museo Nazionale in Naples, an aged man</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clothed in mourning advances to the left across the open fields, leaving behind</p>

  <p class="calibre1">him an horizon apparently aflame with fire and war. A thief, having overtaken</p>

  <p class="calibre1">him from behind, is slyly cutting the cord from which the old man's purse is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hanging. The thief is enframed in a shadowy sphere that represents The World.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Beneath the painting is an inscription in Dutch:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Om dat de Werelt is soe ongetru</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Daer om gha ic in den ru.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Because the world is so untrue</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Therefore go I in mourning.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The face of the old man is not saintly, and it is said that Brueghel himself hesitated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">about the name to give to the picture: <i class="calibre4">False Hermit</i> and the <i class="calibre4">Hypocrite</i> were two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of his choices. (Here is our perfect illustration for <i class="calibre4">Tartuffe!)</i> On the path before</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the pilgrim are three caltrops, sharp metal points of the kind that the soldiery</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Brueghel's time would strew for enemy horses to step on. For us the exci-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ting detail in this picture is the presence, close above the metal points, of two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, and a cluster of vaguely discernible mushrooms to the imme-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">diate right of the tree stump. Here again is the 'Devil's bread' of Bosch. These</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms suggest boleti, but with the passing centuries the painting has de-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">teriorated and the species cannot be identified. Surely it is fair to assume that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they are the <i class="calibre4">heksenzwam</i> or <i class="calibre4">satanzwam,</i> bathed in the aura of witches or Satan.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bosch in his painting developed his own iconographic idiom. It is Christian but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unconventional: the <i class="calibre4">Hay Wain</i> is a strange allegory framed inside the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Christian cosmogony. Brueghel's mushrooms are an iconographic symbol in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">painted homily of profane rather than sacred inspiration. Within the confines</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of conventional Christian iconography we know of only two paintings, in all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the wealth of Christian art, where mushrooms figure. We are indebted to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Director of the Prado Museum, Dr. Sanchez Canton, for drawing to our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attention one of them. In the Prado there hangs a superb <i class="calibre4">Adoration of the Magi,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">painted c. 1610 by Juan Bautista Mayno, an artist of the Spanish school about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">354</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUSHROOMS IN ART</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whom little is known beyond the fact that he was a Spanish Dominican born</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Italy. His <i class="calibre4">Adoration</i> bears witness to his high quality as a painter. His crafts-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">manship is impeccable, his composition noble, the delicacy of the figures and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">faces breathtaking. In the foreground, down below, are two inconspicuous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms growing among some leaves by the side of an unhewn stone.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The mushrooms belong to the agaricaceae, for one of them shows a ring. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">base of the stipe is concealed by vegetation: we cannot say whether there is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">volva. The mushrooms and their boulder are a sinister counterpoise to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Light of the World shining through the aperture from above. Exactly what</p>

  <p class="calibre1">do they mean?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For Bosch in the <i class="calibre4">Hay Wain,</i> for Brueghel in <i class="calibre4">The Misanthrope,</i> mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were a symbol of the forces of Satan, and we think that the same meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attaches to the mushrooms in Mayno's painting.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Virgin on her finely chiseled block of stone is goodness, truth, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beauty. The boulder with the mushrooms growing in a marshy spot is the realm</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of unregenerate nature that is now to be offered redemption. Mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">belonged to that armory of demonic symbols which painters used in the I5th</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and i6th centuries when preaching to the world about Satan and his works.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is true that they used mushrooms sparingly, but the symbolism is abundantly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">clear. Much more common as symbols of the infernal forces were serpents,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lizards, frogs and toads, beetles, and flying insects; in short, all those creatures</p>

  <p class="calibre1">commonly thrown together under the pejorative name of Vermin'.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our interpretation of these early mushrooms finds support in a painting by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a fourth master, Herri met de Bles known as Civetta, 'the Owl', who died in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1550. Of the Flemish school, by cultural heritage he belonged to the world</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Bosch and Brueghel. In the Gemaldegalerie der Akademie der bildenden</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Kiinste, Vienna, there hangs his <i class="calibre4">Christ Bearing the Cross,</i> a small and exquisite</p>

  <p class="calibre1">canvas. The field of the iconographic message in this painting is enframed in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">foreground by a close-up of rough untilled land. We were the first to detect in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this foreground, near the center, two clumps of minute and delicately delineated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms, and a third clump of the same genus is in the lower right hand</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. The corpus of paintings and sculpture expressing the demonic theme from those centuries is considerable,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and has been the subject recently of an illuminating monograph, Enrico Castelli's <i class="calibre4">II Demoniaco nell'Arte,</i> Milan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Florence, 1952.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But mushrooms in the i6th century were not always the stigmata of Satan. In the only etching executed by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Peter Brueghel the Elder, <i class="calibre4">The Rabbit Hunt,</i> dated 1566, two mushrooms appear in the lower right foreground.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They carry no iconographic message. Albrecht Dtirer was responsible for a mediocre woodcut of a polypore,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dated 1513; see F. Lippmann's corpus of his works, No. 912, or F. Winkler's, No. 632. In Michel Angelo Ca-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ravaggio's <i class="calibre4">Christ with Disciples at Emmaus</i> (National Gallery, London) there is a basket of fruit among which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mycologist will detect an apple infected with a fungal parasite.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">corner. Only by the aid of a powerful magnifying glass can they be fully per-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ceived and properly admired. These mushrooms are off-stage, so to speak, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they might be dismissed as a graceful but meaningless phantasy, did we not recall</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the sinister meaning of the mushrooms in the works of Bosch and Brueghel.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We lean to the view that here also the mushrooms are symbolic of the Powers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Darkness, who in this case are working out their woeful role on the highway</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to Golgotha.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Dutch still-life paintings of the iyth and i8th centuries there was a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">delayed manifestation of the demonic theme in art, a strange and lovely after-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">glow that is of peculiar interest to us for the role in it of mushrooms. Among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the scores of accomplished Dutch artists who were at work between 1640</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and 1770 were a handful who chose woodland settings for subjects, closeups</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of woodland undergrowth, in which we discover serpents, lizards, frogs and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toads, beetles, and flying insects. Often the artists added mushrooms of various</p>

  <p class="calibre1">species. These Dutch masters were offering to their customers paintings of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Vermin', creatures that from earliest times had symbolized the Satanic powers.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A century had elapsed since the elder Brueghel's day, and the world had gone</p>

  <p class="calibre1">through the spiritual upheaval of the Reformation. The minor creatures of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">woodland still trailed clouds of evil, but the dark emotions that they now</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evoked were only reflexes of the former nightmares. They were terrors recalled</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in tranquillity and suitable for esthetic delectation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The originator of this theme in Dutch still-lifes was none other than Otto</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Marseus van Schrieck, whose <i class="calibre4">Moth with Mushrooms</i> we have already discussed.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Born in the second decade of the I7th century, he died in the late i67o's. No</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one knows under what master he studied. Little is certain about his life beyond</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fact that he lived long in Italy, that he was in Rome in 1652, that he enjoyed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">considerable success in his day, and that his peculiar choice of subjects set a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fashion which persisted for a century and more. It is said that, after his return</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to Holland, he kept a small private zoo in the garden of his home near Amster-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dam where the creatures that he loved to paint were always ready for his brush.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He was surnamed 'Snuffelaar', one who ferrets.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Van Schrieck was an artist whose work records a deep cultural transition.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the one hand, he was saturated in the sinister folklore attaching to the humble</p>

  <p class="calibre1">creatures that he put on canvas, the dark heritage of past beliefs. Was he not in</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. The Art Museum of Princeton University has lately acquired a companion painting by Civetta, representing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">also the procession on the road to Calvary. Strikingly similar in many respects, it even includes mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the foreground on the right hand side, below the owl that is the artist's signature. But they are hesitant and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">uncertain as compared with the authority of those in the Vienna painting.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">fact the last genuine painter of the demonic tradition? On the other hand, he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was the discoverer of beauty in the lowliest and most despised woodland crea-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tures. He raised even Vermin' to the democracy of the artist's beauteous world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the first time snakes and toads were to give esthetic pleasure. He was the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">first European to perceive and proclaim the visual beauty of mushrooms. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">studied nature with minute care. A snake was no longer just a snake: it was a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">particular species of snake. A mushroom was not just a toadstool, not the Idea</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a fungus such as Bosch had given us. The mushroom world was peopled</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with an infinite variety of discrete growths, each worthy of distinct and precise</p>

  <p class="calibre1">delineation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Was not Van Schrieck, in a significant sense, the earliest of the nature painters?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of course many artists before him had caught the beauty of a landscape. Giants</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like Diirer and Leonardo had executed superb studies of individual plants or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">animals. Various miniaturists had ornamented the margins of manuscripts with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the profile of a bird or bush, catching to perfection the distinctive line of each.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But Van Schrieck added a new element: centuries before Audubon and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">before scientists began to talk about 'ecology', this Dutch painter sensed the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">importance of the ensemble of nature, the interdependence of plants and insects</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and mushrooms and the wild creatures that lived in the undergrowth. Long</p>

  <p class="calibre1">before Linnaeus and the classification of species, he was distinguishing the species</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with his artist's eye, and observing the cycle of life in which each lives as a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">link. He was the first artist whom naturalists can call their own. All those who</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hold wild nature in honor, and especially all amateurs of mushrooms, will pay</p>

  <p class="calibre1">homage to this neglected Dutch master, this pioneer in the exploration of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nature's wonders.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">A peculiarity of Van Schrieck was his addiction to nocturnal settings. Was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there ever other artist who so specialized in painting the night ? How sensitive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his imagination was to the Stygian blackness of deep night in the woodland</p>

  <p class="calibre1">undergrowth! He seems to begrudge even that light which he is forced to use</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to give us a picture at all. What we discover in his paintings is caught by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dazzling illumination from an off-stage light, and the shaft that comes from off</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stage stops short with the creatures that he paints. The moth is caught in air as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by a flashlight, but the light does not race on around the moth to strike else-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where. This effect reminds us of those modern spotlights designed with mathe-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">matical nicety to illuminate the exact area of a canvas or a sculpture. Of course</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Van Schrieck's settings are artificial, like most settings in museums of natural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">history, but each component in the picture is vibrant with life and individuality.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The artist is not content with painting symbols and effigies as iconographs.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">He is not content with dead models. The demonic message is there in the noc-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">turnal scene, but conveyed by living individuals caught in the dance of life and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">death. His settings suggest in a way an aquarium, for the buoyancy of the night</p>

  <p class="calibre1">air makes itself felt in the way all the creatures and the vegetation seem to float</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in a life-sustaining medium. The three Van Schriecks that we reproduce are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chosen for their emphasis on mushrooms. Almost all his paintings include mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms, but these are extreme in this respect, as also for the blackness of the night.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our artist's peculiar qualities find full expression in the painting that hangs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum in Brunswick. Dated 1662, it was probably</p>

  <p class="calibre1">executed in Amsterdam. Van Schrieck had just returned from his long sojourn</p>

  <p class="calibre1">abroad. As usual, the setting is crepuscular. A tulip is overborne in the coils of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a snake of the species elaphe quatuor-lineata. To the right flies one of the saturnine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">moths. A viper is hissing below, and on the ground we discover a bufo calamita</p>

  <p class="calibre1">('calamity toad') licking up a slug. This is the toad that the English name the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">natterjack. On the left a snake that herpetologists call the coluber viridi-flavus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">emerges from behind a clavaria botrytis and then curls through a cluster of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">three mushrooms, of which the one in the middle is a russula and the others</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are Csesar's amanitas. Flies are crawling on the amanitas, and as <i class="calibre4">Fliegenschwamm</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Van Schrieck's day was a name bestowed on various species, he may have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">expected his public to call these mushrooms by that name. The air hangs thick</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with evil import, yet each detail is executed with the care of one who enters</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fully into the beauty of nature's cruel cycle. Van Schrieck's painting long ante-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dated the scientists' nomenclature, of course; with the artist's eye he was anticipat-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing their labors.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Van Schrieck's success in his lifetime should not surprise us. He was born</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into circles with a sophisticated palate for art, and his contribution was an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">original and notable one. He disclosed the beauty of the wilderness with a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">subtlety that far surpassed his predecessors. The labored efforts of the early</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scientific writers were tedious by comparison with his discourses on wild nature</p>

  <p class="calibre1">expressed in line and color. His mushrooms are incomparably superior to those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the professional illustrators who supplied woodcuts for the text of Clusius,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bauhin &amp; Co. His influence soon took hold of other artists, some of whom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">achieved a more lasting reputation than he. The Neapolitan painter Paolo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Porpora surnamed Pavoluccio Napolitano, a contemporary, imitated Van</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Schrieck repeatedly: two Porporas painted in this vein hang in the gallery</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the Banco di Napoli in Naples, and of these we reproduce one.1 Abraham</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Begeyn, about twenty years younger than Van Schrieck, revelled like him in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">woodland subjects and mushrooms, as did also the mysterious Frans Hamilton,1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Anthonie van Borssom, and the German, Johann Albert Angermayer. Later in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same vein came Rachel Ruysch, who lived into the mid-i8th century, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Franz Werner Tamm, born in 1724. All of these distinguished artists loved their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rrmshrooms and knew them, though not like Van Schrieck. Van Schrieck's in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fluence went even beyond them. It may be said of him that he effected the in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tegration of mushrooms into the idiom of painters. Before him in all of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">painting of Europe the absence of mushrooms is conspicuous, if not absolute.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In settings where mushrooms would seem almost compulsory, there were none,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as though good taste compelled good artists to rub them out. After Van Schrieck,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms are never again a surprise. Though rare, they recur sporadically</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and naturally whenever barnyard and outdoor themes seem to call for them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Those other painters who borrowed Van Schrieck's peculiar theme were less</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attached to the demonic import of the subject matter than he was. They admitted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">more light than he did. They would show a patch of daylight sky. They intro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">duced daytime birds. They prettified the whole setting. Van Schrieck's paintings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">repel the uninitiated by their darkness, while his followers' possess a superficial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">charm as quaint period pieces. But what they gained in gentleness they lost</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in focus. They were satisfied with fewer species of mushrooms, and showed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a tendency to stylize them, like stage properties. Their snakes and insects</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tend to be less sharply delineated. In those art circles where the extraordinary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">merits of the Dutch still-life painters are esteemed, Mignon and Ruysch today</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rank above Van Schrieck. From one point of view this is a mistake. For con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">noisseurs both of cultural history and natural history Van Schrieck should stand</p>

  <p class="calibre1">first. He is unique, a cultural <i class="calibre4">trait <b class="calibre5">d'union</b></i> between the world of demonic folk</p>

  <p class="calibre1">beliefs and the beautiful world of nature, where even the lowliest creatures are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">infinitely precious for the understanding eye.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By good fortune we are privileged to attend the very act of artistic alchemy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by which Van Schrieck's peculiar quality was transmuted to suit the conventional</p>

  <p class="calibre1">taste. The year is 1668. Van Schrieck after years of wandering is back in Amster-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dam, active and honored, in his early 5o's. Melchior de Hondecoeter, a brilliant</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. At a time when painting in Scotland was still in its infancy, a cluster of accomplished artists bearing the name</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Hamilton were in fashion in central Europe, exponents of the Dutch school. There were James and Frans,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whose earliest works seem to date from the i66o's, and James in time gave to the world three sons and one</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grandson who were painters. James and Frans were presumably kin, but this is an inference unsupported by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence. It is a fair surmise that they emigrated from Scotland as small children under the Commonwealth,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for their schooling in art was wholly Continental. Such biographical data as appear in the reference works about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them are meager and dubious. It is strange that Scottish genealogists have failed to identify these distinguished</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Continental Scots.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">young artist of 34, paints a picture after the Van Schrieck manner, with mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms, lizard, and butterflies. We can study it today in the Rijksmuseum in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Amsterdam. He retains Van Schrieck's nocturnal effect, devising a powerful</p>

  <p class="calibre1">off-stage light to the left to bathe with dazzling effulgence the foliage and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms on the right. The mushrooms, well delineated, belong to the genus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hypholoma and are probably of the species hypholoma fasciculare. Finches in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">full panoply occupy the center of the canvas, aroused by the presence of a lizard.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some daylight enters from the upper right. The artist signs his painting on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tree-trunk below the knot-hole, and no one challenges the attribution. Honde-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coeter was destined to win renown for his skill in painting birds. Almost two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">centuries before Audubon, he achieved the impossible by catching the stance</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of a bird in its moment of intense vital performance, and in this work he was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">already on his chosen path of special achievement.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Now let us turn from the Hondecoeter in the Rijksmuseum to another version</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the same painting in the National Gallery in London. It is signed above the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">knot-hole and dated I668.1 Here the artist has reassembled the mushrooms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">foliage, birds, butterflies, tree-trunk, and patch of sky. Each of the elements</p>

  <p class="calibre1">carries the same light effects as in the Amsterdam work, but with the re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">distribution of the parts, the Van Schrieck effect of concentrated off-stage high-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lighting is sharply diminished. In these two paintings we see the brilliant artist</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the younger generation, still under the spell of Van Schrieck, experimenting</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the master's methods. In the second he retains mushrooms and Vermin'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but abandons the nocturnal trance.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1 here is a noteworthy thing about the mushrooms painted by Van Schrieck</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and those who followed in his wake: for them all, the attraction of the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room seems to have been visual. They discovered that mushrooms, bathed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in folklore, were also beautiful, and then they stopped. Is there a single Dutch</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or German painting of the iyth or i8th century in which mushrooms appear</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in a context of food; These hereditary mycophobes permitted themselves to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be seduced by mushrooms, but not all the way. More than a century before</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Van Schrieck, Jan Brueghel the Elder, known as Velvet Brueghel, executed</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. In the past this painting has been attributed to Abraham Mignon. We discovered its kinship with the Honde-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coeter in Amsterdam and submitted to Frits Lugt, the authority on Dutch still-lifes, the problem presented by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the diverse attributions. After carefully examining the picture in London, Professor Lugt wrote us that he failed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to see in it the harder, more metallic style of Mignon. Of the signature in the London painting, only 'M' clearly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">survives, and he interpreted this as the 'M' of 'Melchior d'Hondecoeter'. Afterwards, applying a lens to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">area of the signature, we clearly distinguished also the 'd' that precedes the artist's surname. The traditional</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attribution to Mignon is certainly erroneous, based on a mistaken interpretation of the surviving initial of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the name.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">two series of paintings to illustrate the corporeal senses, and today they hang in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Prado. Twice he represented the delights of the palate in a riot of foods of all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">kinds, but among them are no mushrooms. Admirable as Van Schrieck and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his followers were, it seems certain that they followed in Jan Brueghel's train</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and never knew the epicure's delight in a cep or morel. As in the case of Thoreau,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms never made their saliva run. When they painted mushrooms with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">exquisite perception, they made no distinction between the edible and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inedible: clearly for them all were inedible. Thus Paolo Porpora in his canvas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that we reproduce coils his serpents and lizards through a cluster of delectable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">morels. A painter discovers and reveals such truth as lies within the compass of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his visual dimension, and these Dutch artists triumphed over their ancestral</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophobia within the medium at their command but no further.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Van Schrieck's time we have seen that mycophagy was burgeoning among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Flemings, but this cultural innovation seems to have had no parallel among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Dutch. How odd that the line of demarcation between the Protestant and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Catholic worlds should also separate the mycophobes from the mycophagists!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There must be exceptions, but just as no Dutchman or German seems to have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">painted mushrooms in a context of food, so we have found no painter after</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Brueghel identified with Brussels or Antwerp who used mushrooms as a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">demonic symbol. Though the still-life artists of the iyth century never tired of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">painting food, it is a fact that even in Flanders mushrooms figure seldom in those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">paintings. In addition to those that we have discussed on pages 130 if., there is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">superb still-life of the school of Zurbaran in the Art Institute of Chicago, wherein</p>

  <p class="calibre1">two specimens of the psalliota arvensis (as we think them to be) appear, along</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with chestnuts, cheese, almonds, and grapes. Robert Graves in Majorca possesses</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a canvas dated 1656 with a fine show of <i class="calibre4">rovellons</i> (lactarius sanguifluus), which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Catalans esteem above all others, and this canvas is attributed to the Majorcan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">artist Antonio Mesquida.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The oldest painting of mushrooms in the world is a fresco discovered in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">excavations at Herculaneum early in the i8th century and now hanging in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Museo Nazionale in Naples. It must have been executed around'A.D. 50,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perhaps at the very moment when Pliny was composing his chapters on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungi for his <i class="calibre4">Historia Naturalis.</i> These mushrooms seem to belong to the genus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lactarius and are obviously for eating. All of the specific names for mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms that we know from classical Latin have been securely identified, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there is none that we can attach to those in this ancient fresco. Here is a whole-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">some reminder of how little we really know about the mycological knowledge</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the ancients, for we may consider it virtually certain that the ancient in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">habitants of Herculaneum knew the mushrooms of the fresco well and had a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name for them.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is a remarkable thing about this Herculaneum fresco. Let the reader</p>

  <p class="calibre1">compare our reproduction of it with Jan Fyt's canvas, Plate XXIV. In both,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms are scattered in the foreground. In both there are thrushes, stiff</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in death, laid out on a ledge above and behind, in the fresco mistle thrushes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or turdus viscivorus, in Fyt both mistle thrushes and fieldfares or the turdus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pilaris. These artists separated by sixteen centuries hit on the same objects for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their two still-lifes, and the same composition. The fresco could not have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">influenced Fyt, of course, for apparently it was not exhumed from its volcanic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grave until a century after Fyt's time.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1 he mushroom in Renaissance art was originally and principally demonic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in suggestion, as we have seen. In the lovely paintings of Rachel Ruysch and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">F. W. Tamm this demonic vein had spent itself, petering out in the placid</p>

  <p class="calibre1">calms of the i8th century enlightenment. Mycophagy was gaining ground,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in addition Gainsborough and later Corot discovered the idyllic beauty</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of mushroom gathering - a far cry from the terrors of the mushroom in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world of Bosch and Brueghel and Civetta. But the old theme was not altogether</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dead: after all, it had sprung from the very tap roots of Europe's earliest cultural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">world, the mycophobia of the Germanic world that gave us Bosch and Brueghel.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One of the eminent illustrators in 19 th century France was the artist J.-J.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Grandville. He died in the spring of 1847, at 44 years of age. On the eve of his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">death he submitted to the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Magasin Pittoresque</i>&nbsp;two woodcuts of astonishing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">quality, which in due course that journal published.1 These last works of his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were pictorial representations of dreams. The first does not concern us. We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reproduce the second and suggest that the reader examine it with some attention.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Grandville submitted his explanation for this dream, a banal sequence of mean-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ingless images, as he thought. Perhaps this design expressed more than even so</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sensitive an artist as Grandville was aware of. Reading from top to bottom,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the sliver of a moon emerges as a mushroom. By way of an intermediate meta-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">morphosis, the mushroom becomes a parasol, the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">chattra</i>&nbsp;that was the Sanskrit</p>

  <p class="calibre1">metaphor for the mushroomic world. The parasol then transforms itself into a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bat,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">le hot volant</i>&nbsp;of French demonic folklore. The bat, in turn, becomes a bellows,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one of that family of distensible sacs which we found metaphorically linked with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fungal world in various primitive usages. By a strange chance, a number of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these successive designs are emitting a flame, that very flame which with its</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. pp. 210-214,1847.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">supernatural and erotic meaning seems to have been at the taproot of Europe's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungal associations. The bellows, indeed, becomes two flaming hearts transfixed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by a sword, which in turn give way to a rolling spindle, and then a four-wheeled</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chariot drawn by flaming steeds in the direction of a starry firmament.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How strange it is that Grandville in the final emanation of his genius should</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have struck a chord so nicely attuned to the whole argument of our book!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is as though in his subconscious being this ipth century Frenchman recapi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tulated the emotions of his race vis-a-vis the fungal world since earliest times,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and then gave those emotions expression in a design of breathtaking simplicity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and beauty. It is almost as though, with a hundred years of anticipation, he was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">putting the seal of his subconscious approval on a number of our suggestions.</p>
