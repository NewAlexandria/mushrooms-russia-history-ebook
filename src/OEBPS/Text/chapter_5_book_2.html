            <p><span class="initial">I</span>n research it is often the small remainder of unexplained evidence that points the road to further discoveries, and even perhaps to an abrupt step-up in the scope and thrust of the inquirer&rsquo;s purpose. We believe that we may have discovered for the first time the explanation for the &lsquo;toadstool&rsquo;, the secret lying in the original but now forgotten sense of &lsquo;poison-stool&rsquo;. But our answer to this question leaves certain tantalizing facts unreconciled. Why do the Danes for &lsquo;toadstool&rsquo; say&nbsp;<i>paddehat,</i>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;<i>tudsehatt</i> <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b2-fn1" id="cp5b2-r1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;Of their two words for &lsquo;toad&rsquo;, why do they link with the wild fungi the one that does not refer to the poisonous secretion? In English too we find paddock-stool. In Dutch there exists no name for the toad, so far as we know, that means &lsquo;the poisonous one&rsquo; yet the Dutch also say&nbsp;<i>paddestoel.</i></p>

            <p>In short, while we have perhaps explained the word &lsquo;toadstool&rsquo;, we have not answered the whole of our question, for we find toads linked with fungi where poison is not involved. We must ask ourselves whether there was not a deeper and broader association between toads and mushrooms, whether the two orders of living things did not possess in common some other attribute that originally struck the primitive fancy and led to verbal kinship. If this be so, then the words based on the common attribute of poison may have been a late development, restricted in area, superimposed on an older and broader verbal stratum, a verbal variation on an exceedingly ancient theme. The use of <i>toxicum</i> in the context of toads and fungi may have been merely a Latinism devised by practitioners of an esoteric witchcraft cult around the North Sea basin in the early centuries of the Christian era.</p>

            <p>It turns out, indeed, when we look further afield, that the toad-fungus link is not confined to the North Sea countries. In two areas of the Continent, far removed from each other in every sense, the same semantic tie occurs. First, there is the Basque country of Spain (not France), where in the Basque language several names for wild mushrooms involve the Basque word for toad, which is&nbsp;<i>zapo</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>apo</i>&nbsp;or (in certain combinations)&nbsp;<i>amo</i> <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b2-fn2" id="cp5b2-r2">[2]</a></sup>. The amanita muscaria, which in parts of France is sometimes called&nbsp;<i>crapaudin,</i>&nbsp;carries a Basque name in parts of the Biscay and Guipuzcoa country that is an exact semantic equivalent of the French word: viz.,&nbsp;<i>amoroto.</i>&nbsp;In a contiguous area&nbsp;<i>apontto</i> is the name bestowed on a certain distrusted wild fungus, and this word also serves thereabouts as a term of personal abuse. The root is <i>apo</i>, &lsquo;toad&rsquo;, in both these words. Two excellent species of wild mushrooms, marasmius oreades and marasmius urens, are rejected by the Basques of the same provinces, who call them &lsquo;viper-fungus&rsquo; and &lsquo;toad-fungus&rsquo; &mdash; <i>suge-perretxiko</i> and <i>zapo-perretxiko.</i> (Note this our first encounter with the viper theme.) Except in the Basque country, we have found no trace of the toad figure in the fungal vocabulary of Spain, but we possess one straw of evidence indicating that formerly it was in use. Dr. Stephan F. Borhegyi, the Hungarian archeologist working in Guatemala, on a visit to the village of Jocotan in the Department of Chiquimula, discovered that the Spanish-speaking people in that community used neither <i>hongo</i> nor <i>seta</i> for &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo;: their pejorative term for species believed to be poisonous is <i>sombrilla de sapo,</i> &lsquo;toad&rsquo;s parasol&rsquo;. Remote Jocotan is known to linguists for the Spanish archaisms that survive there, and one assumes that the <i>sombrilla de sapo</i> is a fossilized survival of an expression current somewhere in 16<sup>th</sup> century Spain.</p>

            <p>Far from the Basque country, in the Ukraine, the natives speak of any wild mushroom that they reject as <i>zhabjachyj hryb</i> &mdash; the toad-like mushroom. A little to the West, in Slovakia near Tatra, a native informant reports to us that such despised fungi are variously called <i>zabaci huby,</i> the toad-fungi; <i>had&rsquo;ad</i> <i>huby</i> and <i>had&rsquo;unke huby,</i> both meaning viper-fungi; or <i>salene huby,</i> mad fungi. We are unable to circumscribe the area in the Slav world where the toad theme survives in the mushroom vocabulary. It is unknown in Great Russia.</p>

            <p>The semantic analogies between the Basque terms and those used in the Ukraine and Slovakia, combined with the evidence around the North Sea, suggest a profound substratum of folk associations between fungi and toads in the Indo-European world, a substratum that is today everywhere silted over except for the three outcroppings on the map of Europe <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b2-fn3" id="cp5b2-r3">[3]</a></sup>. This inference finds support in a further surprising fact. Throughout the Slav world the most beloved general word for the edible mushroom of forest and field is, in its Russian form, <i>grib.</i> In the Slavic mind there is no association between this happy word and the creature we call <i>zhaba,</i> the toad. But now turn to the Catalan language. There we find that the word for toad is <i>gripau.</i> No Catalan connects it with wild fungi. Yet it seems clear that the etymological root of Catalan <i>gripau</i> and of Russian <i>grib</i> is identical! That root, surviving virtually unchanged from remote times in two widely separated languages in words with wholly different meanings, carries the sense of gripping, grabbing, seizing, scraping, grubbing, digging. Here is no allusion to poison, no kinship with <i>toxicum.</i> If &lsquo;toad&rsquo; evolved from <i>toxicum,</i> it is a late and geographically circumscribed intruder in verbal history, by comparison with the perspectives that we now contemplate. Only by a kind of linguistic triangulation into the past can we arrive at a reconciliation of Russian <i>grib</i> and Catalan <i>gripau.</i> And we must defer this until we have explored certain other matters.</p>

            <p>It would be easy to spin an argument that in the early European mind toads and fungi shared a chthonian existence &mdash; toads hibernating in soft earth and then thrusting themselves to the surface; fungi living out the better part of their existence hidden in the soil, but, when circumstances are propitious, shouldering their way through the soil&rsquo;s crust to the light of day. One could even postulate a primitive earth-cult with its focus of worship in the earthy toad and the toadstool. But perhaps we can find a more solid basis for inquiries than such facile and unsubstantial speculations.</p>
