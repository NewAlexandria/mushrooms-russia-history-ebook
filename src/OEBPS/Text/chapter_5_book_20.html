  <p class="calibre1">Mycologists sensitive to the fitness of things are the first to admit that their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nomenclature for mushrooms offers a spectacle of unscientific confusion, an ac-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cumulation of infelicities. Scientific names should be keyed to significant aspects</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the organisms that they designate, and there should be uniformity in use.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Instead, many of the scientific names for mushrooms serve only to remind us</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the errors of early mycologists, and any given species is likely to carry two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or more names that are in simultaneous currency in different countries. It even</p>

  <p class="calibre1">happens that a single scientific name is commonly employed for different kinds!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(It seems certain, for example, that two of the famous mushrooms, the amanita</p>

  <p class="calibre1">muscaria and the amanita phalloides, are different species in Europe from their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">American namesakes and it is perilous to assume that attributes securely estab-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lished for them in one continent hold true across the ocean.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In formal use, following each name is the surname of the mycologist who de-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scribed it, or perhaps two such names, and so the objectivity that is the proper vir-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tue of science becomes tinctured with the frailty of those who gladly permit their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">names to be hitched to a mushroom, perhaps tempted by a vain hope for worldly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">immortality, if only in union with a fungus.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mycological nomenclature got off to a bad start with Carolus Linnaeus, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">18th century Swedish name-giver. Like Adam he surveyed the living world and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bestowed names on all the flora and fauna, but he seems to have hurried a little</p>

  <p class="calibre1">impatiently over the numerous and baffling and humble fungi. He chose to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">make use of terms drawn from ancient Greek and Latin, but did not pause to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ascertain their rightful meanings. He misapplied almost every one of them. But</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by the weight of his immense prestige, he stamped the old words with his new</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meanings, and these are now current the world over. They are current the world</p>

  <p class="calibre1">over - save here and there among the peasants of Greece and Italy and France,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where vernacular variants of the words used by their ancestors two thousand</p>

  <p class="calibre1">years ago still circulate with their ancient sense, and hold their own against the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">new-fangled meanings that prevail in learned circles.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In extenuation of the Linnaean terminology it can be pleaded that the classical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words had already been misused by his precursors, such as Clusius and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. In this book we have not capitalized scientific names, thereby wilfully violating accepted practice. Only in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">High German are common nouns capitalized, and this German usage disfigures the page with capital letters;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it is not to be encouraged. Scientific names are not proper nouns: they designate congregations of similar</p>

  <p class="calibre1">individuals. There is no more reason why 'lycoperdon' should be capitalized than the synonym 'pufifbalT.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bauhins, and that he merely refined the application of names accepted in scientific</p>

  <p class="calibre1">circles since the Renaissance. Even if this be true, we may regret that the great</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Linnaeus did not rise to the occasion, and with his papal authority impose a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sound system of names conforming to the classical meanings of the words that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he was using. There was no difficulty about those classical meanings. Before the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century was out, the French mycologist, Jean-Jacques Paulet, in his <i class="calibre4">Traite</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">des Champignons</i> published in Paris in 1793, was discoursing on the nonsense</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the official nomenclature and elucidating the classical usage.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Take the Latin <i class="calibre4">boletus,</i> for example. In imperial Rome this was the name of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">superb amanita Caesarea, that yellow-capped gilled mushroom which was the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">favorite of emperors and epicures. It was undoubtedly borrowed from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greek βωλίτης which in turn was derived from βῶλος, meaning a clod of earth.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mushrooms smell and sometimes look like earthy excrescences, and in <i class="calibre4">boletus</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">we discover another of the basic metaphors used in the fungal world, of which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we have already identified many others. The same figure underlies the famous</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Russian <i class="calibre4">gruzd',</i> a derivative of <i class="calibre4">gruda,</i> meaning 'clod'. The Greek term must</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have been pejorative, but when fashionable Rome took to mycophagy, <i class="calibre4">boletus</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">acquired an aura of excellence that survives to this day. Caesar's <i class="calibre4">boletus</i> is said</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to be still called <i class="calibre4">thefongo bolado</i> or <i class="calibre4">bole</i> around Verona, and <i class="calibre4">boule</i> in some parts</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Provence. <i class="calibre4">Bolet</i> is the general term for fungi, especially those with gills,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">among the mycophilic Catalans. When the Germans needed a new and favor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">able word to make mushrooms acceptable on the table, we have seen that they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">turned <i class="calibre4">boletus</i> into <i class="calibre4">Pilz;</i> and one of the general words for 'mushroom' in Ru-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">manian is <i class="calibre4">burete,</i> with the same etymology.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the light of this history, it is disappointing that Linnaeus ratified the sever-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ance of that fine old <i class="calibre4">boletus</i> from its ancient moorings, and assigned it to capped</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms with a spongy undersurface. The untutored peasants of the Medi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terranean lands who still apply the word to gilled mushrooms speak with an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">authority derived from far older credentials than the mycologists can show,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and - who knows? - possibly their usage will outlast the new.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The mushrooms that mycologists call 'boleti' were the <i class="calibre4">suilli</i> of the Ro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mans, the swine-fungi, a name that comes down to us in modern Italy in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">translation <i class="calibre4">porcino</i> (boletus edulis) and <i class="calibre4">pordnello</i> (boletus scaber). The books are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wrong when they explain these names by an alleged fondness among pigs for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the boleti. These are the species that develop a greasy texture suggestive of pork</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. The meanings of the classical words for the fungi have been examined twice by English students: (i) by the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Rev. Wm. Houghton, 'Notices of Fungi in Greek and Latin Authors', in the <i class="calibre4">Annals &amp; Magazine of Natural</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">History,</i> Series v, vol. 15, Jan. 1885, pp. <i class="calibre4">22 ff;</i> and (2) by Prof. A. H. R. Buller, 'The Fungus Lore of the Greeks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Romans', <i class="calibre4">Transactions of the British Mycological Society,</i> vol. v, part I, May 10, 1915, pp. 21 ff.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when cooked in the fresh state; and when dried, they taste like dried meat.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This meatiness explains why they are great favorites among the monks of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Russian Church in the long fasts. Today these 'swine-fungi' are considered <i class="calibre4">kosher</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">among the Jews of Eastern Europe, but our friend Professor Uriel Weinreich,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">authority on the Ashkenazic culture, reports to us a curious fact. From an infor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mant of Polotsk he learned that in that area the Jews down to modern times have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">regarded the boletus edulis as <i class="calibre4">treyf,</i> or unclean, and have not eaten it. May not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this be a survival of a very old tradition? For the Jews of Russia mostly mi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">grated thither from the West, passing a long stage in Germany on the way, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the association of these mushrooms with the pig in Italy may well have elimi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nated them from the diet of Jews.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Reverting now to the mycologists, we find that they have borrowed the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greek word for truffle, ύδνον, to apply to the wholly different hydnaceae family,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the Greek word for puffball, πέζις, to apply to the wholly different peziza</p>

  <p class="calibre1">group, and the Greek word for the field mushroom, άμανῖται, to apply to the clan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known nowadays as the amanitas. The Latin word for truffle, <i class="calibre4">tuber,</i> alone</p>

  <p class="calibre1">survives in its original meaning. No purpose was served by these shifts in mean-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing: they were merely an evidence of bad classical education and an unscien-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tific carelessness with words.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Another example of this abuse of language is the fate of the Latin word <i class="calibre4">aga-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ricum,</i> the Greek άγαρικόν. Surprising as it may seem, the ancient Romans were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not unfamiliar with the fungi of the region that we call Russia. Today 'aga-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ricus' is the name for the gilled fungi, but it was Linnaeus who imposed this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning. The ancients applied the word to the shelf-fungus that grew on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">larch, now known as the femes officinalis, used since ancient times medicinally.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dioscorides explained for us that the name was taken from the land of Agaria,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lying on the northern shores of what we call the Sea of Azov, there where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mariners would steer their course by Point Agarum, halfway between the mouth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the River Don and the ragged peduncle by which the Crimean peninsula</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hangs from the Continental land-mass. The physicians of Agaria enjoyed renown</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in those times, and at the Court of Mithridates the Great some of them were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">always in attendance. Probably the medical school of Agaria was the first to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover the medicinal virtue of the ancient <i class="calibre4">agaricum.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">On the shaky foundation of Linnaeus' basic names for the mushrooms, errors</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and infelicities have continued to pile up. There is the spring-tide amanita, or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">amanita verna, which grows in the autumn. There is the amanita phalloides,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which ought to be 'phallus-like'. Not at all! To explain that name we must look</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at another fungus, most distantly related, which does resemble a phallus and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which is called the phallus impudicus. Around the base of the stem of the amanita</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phalloides there grows a 'cup' that superficially resembles the 'cup' of the phallus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">impudicus, and this feature, unrelated to any phallus but shared by the two</p>

  <p class="calibre1">species, is the trivial justification for the name of the amanita phalloides! There</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is the gyromitra esculenta, widely sold in the market places of Europe, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whose esculent virtues have been occasionally tarnished by mysterious fatal-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ities. Linnaeus himself bestowed on the lactarius deliciosus its misleading name.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It seems that reports reached him of the esteem in which a certain lactarius was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">held in the south of Europe, and he assumed that it was the one with which he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was familiar in Sweden, and so bestowed on the kind he knew the name that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rightfully belonged to another.1 By this blunder he started endless confusion</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and misunderstanding. The lactarius deliciosus is not delicious, and the species</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that Linnaeus thought he was baptizing is now known as the lactarius sanguifluus,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the <i class="calibre4">rovello</i> of the Catalans, the species on which the Majorcans bestow the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">delightful name of <i class="calibre4">exclatasangs,</i> or 'blood-spatterers'. The milk of this kind is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reddish, whereas the so-called lactarius deliciosus yields saffron droplets.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">One of the greatest of mycologists was Elias Fries, also a Swede. About him</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there is a story to tell that, so far as we know, has never been told before. Men</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of learning are sometimes inclined to patronize lesser mortals, but they are them-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">selves subject to occupational hazards of their own, pedantic errors and odd mani-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">festations of ignorance, and Fries offers us an instructive example of the pedantic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fallacy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It was in 1601, as we have said on an earlier page, that the Frenchman known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as Carolus Clusius published his great herbal, <i class="calibre4">Rariorum Plantarum Historia,</i> in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which he devoted many pages to descriptions of the fungi of Hungary. Among</p>

  <p class="calibre1">others, he discussed the species known to the French as the <i class="calibre4">mousseron,</i> and to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">science as the tricholoma gambosum or tricholoma georgii. We reproduce in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">facsimile the relevant passage of his text. The reader will observe that Clusius</p>

  <p class="calibre1">begins by giving the Hungarian and German names of the mushroom, <i class="calibre4">Szent</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">Gyewrgi</b> gambaia</i> and <i class="calibre4">Sant Georg schwammen</i> respectively. Both names mean the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same thing, viz., St. George's mushroom, <i class="calibre4">gambaia</i> being the appropriate gram-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">matical form of the Magyar word <i class="calibre4">gamba</i> or <i class="calibre4">gomba,</i> 'mushroom', a word bor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rowed from the Slavs and cousin to the Russian <i class="calibre4">guba.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">More than two centuries later, in 1821, Elias Fries published his <i class="calibre4">Sy'sterna My-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">cologicum,</i> one of the classics of mycological writing. In it he bestowed on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">species that Clusius had already described the name agaricus gambosus, adding</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the comment that he suspected this was edible because of its odor of fresh flour!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">(There speaks the mycophobic Swede.) He thought it was the true agaricus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">georgii, as to which there had been much confusion. Here are Fries's words:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hunc pro vero A. Georgii, quo nil magis confusum,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">et ob odorem farinse recentis edulem suspicor.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Fries did not explain his use of <i class="calibre4">gambosus,</i> but he referred to the very passage</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Clusius that we have reproduced, and therefore it was not at all surprising</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when, in 1827, a learned confrere, Kurt Sprengel, in editing the i6th edition</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Linnaeus' <i class="calibre4">Sy sterna Vegetabilium,</i> retained the older name, agaricus georgii, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then added, again in Latin, a slighting reference to Fries's term, saying that it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was derived from the Hungarian word in Clusius and that it was an unhappy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">choice; which indeed it was.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the following year, 1828, Fries gave vent to his pique at this reprimand in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his <i class="calibre4">Elenchus Fungomm.</i> Again using Latin, he said that Sprengel, 'most learned in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">botanical literature', was mistaken in tracing the excellent name, agaricus gam-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bosus, to the Hungarian <i class="calibre4">gambaia,</i> which he had never thought nor even heard of.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Instead, the nature of the mushroom had inspired him to borrow from the Latin</p>

  <p class="calibre1">author Vegetius the word <i class="calibre4">gamba</i>!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This was a most unwise assertion for the great Fries to make. Despite his asser-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion to the contrary, he was, as his text had expressly said, familiar with Clusius.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He had clearly misread Clusius, construing <i class="calibre4">gambaia</i> as a specific name rather</p>

  <p class="calibre1">than the Magyar word for 'mushroom'. When challenged, he took refuge in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">late Latin writer's use <i class="calibre4">of gamba,</i> which in Vegetius, as we have seen, meant a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">swelling on the hock of a horse. Certainly no one, not even a Swedish mycologist,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would associate by first intention the lovely <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> with a swelling on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hock of a horse! Nor even with a hoof of a horse, which is an alternative mean-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing. By devising the name 'agaricus gambosus', Fries unwittingly was describ-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing the <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> as of the genus 'agaricus', species 'fungus'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">By reason of Fries's error, the mycologists have inherited, apparently in per-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">petuity, an absurd scientific name for the simple <i class="calibre4">mousseron,</i> a name that survives</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the modern 'tricholoma gambosum'. If, as we argued on an earlier page, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word <i class="calibre4">gamba</i> in Vegetius was a borrowing from the barbarians of Central and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Eastern Europe, then that was the same <i class="calibre4">gamba</i> that appears in Clusius, and Fries</p>

  <p class="calibre1">did not advance his cause in the slightest by digging up the writings of the Roman</p>

  <p class="calibre1">veterinary.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">How refreshing it is to turn from the unhappy nomenclature of the myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the generic word for mushrooms in Romany, <i class="calibre4">x</i> or <i class="calibre4">xuxur.</i> To illustrate the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">complexity of the problems presented by popular mushroom names, we shall</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cite the case of the delectable mushroom known to science as the tricho-loma</p>

  <p class="calibre1">equestre, which in the mushroom world holds the rare distinction of growing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in sand. It enjoys great renown along the coast of the Landes, in Gascony, under the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name <i class="calibre4">bidaou.</i> Some miles to the east, in the sauterne country around Podensac,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this same mushroom, highly esteemed, is the <i class="calibre4">pied d'ane,</i> or ass's hoof. In the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">neighboring region of Entre-deux-mers, famous among wine-lovers, it is the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Catalan,</i> a name used elsewhere in the Gironde for the lactarius deliciosus. Beyond</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Dordogne around St. Andre de Cubzac, it becomes the <i class="calibre4">jaunisson.</i> Nearby, in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the canton of Cavignac, where the <i class="calibre4">langue d'oil</i> is spoken, our tricho-loma</p>

  <p class="calibre1">equestre is known as the <i class="calibre4">bourseau,</i> from a local word meaning to swell or</p>

  <p class="calibre1">distend. Thus here in an area of France that could be covered by a pocket</p>

  <p class="calibre1">handkerchief, so to speak, a single species of mushroom, well known to everyone,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bears five distinct names.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wherever the latent metaphor in a popular name for a mushroom can be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">deciphered, it is invariably accurate in observation and true in feeling. In the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">course of these pages we have uncovered many of these inner meanings, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there has been no occasion to refer to some of the best. Take the curious case</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the cantharellus cibarius. No one has discovered the name for it in ancient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times, but since it carries today more names by far than any other wild mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Europe, we must suppose that it was known to our remote ancestors also.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In most of the Slavic countries its name is keyed to the fox, e. g., the Russian</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">lisichki,</b></i> 'little foxes', and the Hungarians translated this to arrive at their <i class="calibre4">roka-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">gomba.</i> The Lithuanian <i class="calibre4">lapelaizis</i> means the 'fox-licked one': foxes like squirrels</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are great mycophages. In Old Czech of the i4th century we find the term <i class="calibre4">lisa</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">huba,</i> 'fox's mushroom'. The Bulgarians use an expression that is wholly their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">own, <i class="calibre4">pachi kraka,</i> the 'duck's foot', a happy figure of speech, as will be perceived</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by any mycophile who recalls the color and shape of the webbed foot of a duck,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">idly suspended in air or water.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The German <i class="calibre4">Pfifferling</i> or 'peppery one' is an inappropriate changeling. This</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name rightly belonged to the lactarius piperatus, as we can prove by the descrip-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion of it given in the <i class="calibre4">Adnotationes</i> of Valerius Cordus in the I53o's:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sunt enim quidam Piperis sapore et lacteo liquore manant. Hos</p>

  <p class="calibre1">German! <i class="calibre4">Pffferlinge</i> vocant.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For there are some with the taste of pepper, and they flow with a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">milky fluid. These the Germans call <i class="calibre4">Pfifferlinge.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">370</p>

  <p class="calibre1">UNSCIENTIFIC NOMENCLATURE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Two centuries earlier Konrad von Megenberg in his <i class="calibre4">Das Buck der Natur</i> also</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speaks of the <i class="calibre4">Pfifferling,</i> which he says is of questionable edibility. It seems that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">when the Germans began to take to mycophagy, they appropriated an existing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name of another mushroom to apply to the cantharellus cibarius, a small mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room that all true mycophiles hold in modest esteem; wherefore in time the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">German name acquired a secondary meaning, to designate anything trivial,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in this sense the German word turns up in French in a single expression:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cela ne vaut pas un fifrelin.1 In Austria our little chanterelle is the <i class="calibre4">Eierschwamm,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggestive of the scrambled eggs that these mushrooms resemble and with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which in Austria they are often prepared.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Of the many names for the cantharellus cibarius in France, the <i class="calibre4">girolle</i> and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">chanterelle</i> are the most widely known. The French philologists Oscar Bloch</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Albert Dauzat both assert that <i class="calibre4">chanterelle</i> entered the French language in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the middle of the 18th century, and that it was taken from the scientific name</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bestowed on the mushroom by Linnaeus - 'cantharellus' - which in turn (accord-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing to the French philologists) he devised from a Latin word <i class="calibre4">cantharella,</i> a little</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cup. This etymology is <i class="calibre4">prima facie</i> suspect, for popular names bestowed on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms by French peasants are not normally derived from learned terms of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Linnaean inspiration. In fact, the philologists are mistaken. Jean Bauhin in his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">great <i class="calibre4">Historia Plantarum Universalis,</i> published in 1650-1 and written a half century</p>

  <p class="calibre1">earlier, reported that <i class="calibre4">chanterelle</i> was in his time the popular name of the mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">around Montbeliard, in the east of France. Clearly the mycologists Latinized</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the word as they found it. <i class="calibre4">Chanterelle</i> is a name of popular inspiration descended</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the Latin diminutive <i class="calibre4">cantharulus,</i> formed from <i class="calibre4">canthams,</i> which in turn was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">borrowed from the Greek κάνθάρος, drinking cup. Possibly there is collateral</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence of this origin in a word that survives in the archaic Spanish spoken in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jocotan, Guatemala <i class="calibre4">-canturula,</i> the name of an ear-shaped fungus that grows on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">old trees.2 Words that circulate chiefly on the tongues of humble people undergo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">subtle pressures and transformations, being re-shaped to conform to punning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggestions and metaphorical associations. Perhaps there is evidence of this in</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">chanterelle.</i> This little mushroom in Italian is the <i class="calibre4">gallinaccio,</i> 'turkey-cock'. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Dutch it is the <i class="calibre4">hanekarn,</i> 'cock's comb', though Dutchmen, being mostly myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phobes, often know not the word in this sense. The Dutch and Italian words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggest the masculinity of the cock. In Catalan the chanterelle is the <i class="calibre4">rossinyol:</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. The mushroom seems to have been widely used as a symbol of worthlessness. We have seen that the English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'trifle' was a truffle, the word having been borrowed long before the truffle rose to its present heights in social</p>

  <p class="calibre1">esteem and market value. Juan Corominas in his note on the Spanish <i class="calibre4">seta</i> points out that it has carried the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same metaphoric meaning.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. See Lisandro Sandoval's <i class="calibre4">Semdntica Guatemalense o Diaionario de Guatemalteqitismos,</i> Guatemala, April 1941.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this is said to be derived from&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">ros, rossa,</i>&nbsp;an adjective that describes to a nicety</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the red-gold color of the lovely mushroom. But&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">rossinyol</i>&nbsp;also means 'nightingale',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and it happens that, just as the dove or&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">paloma</i>&nbsp;is the symbol of the beloved in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French and Spanish popular tradition, the nightingale is the symbol of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lover.1 In Bulgaria, as we have seen, the chanterelle is linked with the drake.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">These ornithological ties, always masculine, are curious. Does not&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">chanterelle</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">itself suggest singing and&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">chantecler?</i>&nbsp;Are we not in the presence of an eruption,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">subtle and unconscious, of the old erotic theme, by way of the cock's comb,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the gobbler's wattles, the crowing chanticleer, the virile&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">rossinyol?</i>&nbsp;If our surmise</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be right, confirmation must be sought, not in the sophisticated ratiocinations of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scholars, but rather in the emotional associations of the untutored folk when</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they use their homely words for the little yellow mushroom. If our surmise</p>

  <p class="calibre1">be right, the deep-seated eroticism of the fungal consciousness of Europe is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">erupting again, before our eyes, in the words born of popular fancy or reshaped</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by popular pressure to designate the cantharellus cibarius. Like murder, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shameless μύκης will out. Our straws of evidence permit us to discern the erotic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">theme as through a glass, darkly. How pleasing it is for us, then, our surmise</p>

  <p class="calibre1">having been formulated, to discover corroboration for it in eastern Europe. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Latvian language the name of the cantharellus cibarius&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">isgailene,</i>&nbsp;derived im-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mediately from&nbsp;<i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">gailis,</b></i>&nbsp;'cock', a word that is kin to the Latin&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">gallus.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The alternative word in French for the chanterelle&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">isgirolle.</i>&nbsp;French philologists</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seem satisfied that this word shares the same root as 'gyrate', but there is no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence for this.&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Girolle</i>&nbsp;is a borrowing from Provencal, where the name is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">current in many variations extending over the langue d'oc area of France and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">throughout Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Jirgola</i>&nbsp;in Majorca corresponds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">girbola</i>&nbsp;in Catalan, and in Frederic Mistral's Proven9al dictionary we find</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the word in myriad forms. No other mushroom anywhere seems to possess</p>

  <p class="calibre1">so many names, of which here are the ones we have collected:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">biroudelo escrabilho girbouleto jargouleto</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bouchinguello gerilho</p>

  <p class="calibre1">girello</p>

  <p class="calibre1">jirboulelo</p>

  <p class="calibre1">caramillo ghidorelo girgouleto jotrel</p>

  <p class="calibre1">crahilho ghirolou girgoulo ziraoudela</p>

  <p class="calibre1">escarabiho giraudello iredela</p>

  <p class="calibre1">zitello</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here we leave an enigma for ethno-mycologists to apply themselves to - in an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">area unsurpassed for mycophagy, an important mushroom parades an unrivalled</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. See Wm. J. Entwistle's comments on&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">El Conde Olinos</i>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Romance Philology,</i>&nbsp;vol. vil, No. I, Aug. 1953, p. 13.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3 7 2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">UNSCIENTIFIC NOMENCLATURE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">diversity of interrelated popular names, all of unknown meaning and all reduced</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in French to the lovely but deceptively simple&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">girolle.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">So much for the chanterelles. In Swiss German the clavaria or coral mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is known as the&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Ziegenbart,</i>&nbsp;or goat's beard, which is a good metaphor, but it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is topped, we think, by the happiest name in all of Europe's mushroom voca-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bulary, the Catalan word for the same fungus, which is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">pens de rata,</i>&nbsp;or rat's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">paws. The soft, marvelously fine articulation of the paws of a rat are the perfect</p>

  <p class="calibre1">analogy for the corresponding extremities of the coral mushroom, and in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this mushroomic name we possess a supreme example of the perception of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peasants.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sometimes the mycologists have paid obeisance to popular terminology. For</p>

  <p class="calibre1">example, the name of the puffball, lycoperdon, is a learned back-formation to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a non-existent Greek term that would mean 'wolf's flatus'. How much better</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it would have been to use the genuine Greek name for the same fungus, πέζις&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">which harbors the same indelicate idea!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It might be thought that the mycologists of the world, being a relatively small</p>

  <p class="calibre1">group, could agree together to wipe the slate clean and begin anew, giving no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hostages to vested interests, and devise a system of solidly grounded mushroomic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">names. But such reforms seem beyond the capacity of men, even scientists, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">perhaps this is just as well. A nomenclature that is encumbered with barbarisms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pedantic fallacies, and infelicities is a perpetual and humbling reminder that scien-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tists themselves are ordinary clay, even when they are cultivating their own</p>

  <p class="calibre1">garden.</p>
