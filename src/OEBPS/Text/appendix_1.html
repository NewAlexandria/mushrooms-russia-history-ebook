  <p>THRICE in <i class="calibre4">Anna Karenina</i> Leo Tolstoy brings mushroom-gathering into his story, and on&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.2;">each occasion with a naturalness, a tenderness, that any perceptive reader will find</span></p>

  <p class="calibre1">memorable. We have summarized one of these citations in our text. Here are the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other two.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Chapter 8 of Part in we discover Darya Alexandrovna in the country with her brood</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of small children and the English Governess, Miss Hull. It is the month of May. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">children have returned from Church, where, according to the Orthodox custom, they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have taken Holy Communion. At first, under the influence of that solemn occasion, they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were models of behavior. But at dinner Grisha whistled, and besides he was rude to Miss</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hull. As a punishment, she deprived him of his tart. There were tears, and cries of injustice,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and Grisha left the table, seeking the consolation of solitude by the window in the drawing</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room. His elder sister Tanya, under the pretext that she wished to share her tart with her</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dolls, also departed. Darya Alexandrovna felt that Miss Hull had been too severe, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of course supported her authority. Afterwards she was on her way to ask the governess to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">relent and forgive the culprit, when she discovered Tanya sharing her tart with Grisha</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the drawing room, both of the children sobbing from shared emotion. She was overcome</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by the touching spectacle. On the spot she forgave Grisha, and then dispersed the clouds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by laughing at the way their faces were smeared with tart and tears, and making them</p>

  <p class="calibre1">laugh too, and then, to cap it all, she gave orders for everyone to put on old clothes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and go mushroom-gathering. At once the nursery was filled with shrieks of ecstasy.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Soon they were all in the woods. They filled a basket with mushrooms. Even little Lily</p>

  <p class="calibre1">found a birch-mushroom. In the past Miss Hull had always found mushrooms for Lily</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to pick, but this time Lily really found a big one all by herself, and everyone screamed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with delight: "Lily has found a mushroom!"</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The second episode, in Chapter 5 of Part vi, is an exquisite vignette of distinctive Russian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">behavior. Sergej Ivanovich, a landowner, is in love with the governess Varvara Andreevna</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and wishes to propose to her, and with this intention goes out to find her in the woods</p>

  <p class="calibre1">where she is gathering mushrooms with the children. She senses his purpose and is receptive.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As he starts out looking for her, he talks to himself, rehearsing the little speech that he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wishes to make. And now we shall translate Tolstoy's words.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"Varvara Andreevna, when I was still young, I conceived the ideal woman</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whom I should love and be happy to call my wife. I have lived a long time and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">now at last in you I discover what I have always sought. I love you and offer</p>

  <p class="calibre1">you my hand."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This is what Sergej Ivanovich was saying to himself as he approached Varen'ka,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who was shielding a mushroom from Grisha and calling to little Masha: "Look!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Look! Lots of little mushrooms!" her voice warm and throaty.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When she saw Sergey Ivanovich coming up to her, she did not rise, nor even</p>

  <p class="calibre1">change her position, yet something told him she knew he was there and was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">glad.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"Have you found any?" she asked, turning up to him her beautiful, soft,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">smiling face, rimmed with a white kerchief.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"Not one," said he. "And you;"</p>

  <p class="calibre1">She did not answer but busied herself with the children. "There is another,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">near the branch," and she pointed out to Masha a small <i class="calibre4">syroezhka,</i> whose stal-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wart pink cap had been bisected by a blade of grass. Varen'ka rose when Masha</p>

  <p class="calibre1">picked up the <i class="calibre4">syroezhka,</i> breaking it in two. "This brings back childhood days,"</p>

  <p class="calibre1">she added, and walked away from the children by the side of Sergej Ivanovich.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">They took a few steps in silence. Varen'ka saw that he wished to talk, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">guessed about what. She was breathless with excitement, joy, and fear. They</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had gone far enough so that no one could hear them, yet he did not speak. It</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would have been best if Varen'ka had kept still. After a spell of silence, it would</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have been easier for them to say all they had to say. But against her will, as if</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by accident, Varen'ka spoke.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"So you found nothing? Of course, they are always scarcest in the middle of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the woods."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sergej Ivanovich sighed and said nothing. He was vexed: why had she brought</p>

  <p class="calibre1">back the subject of mushrooms? He would have liked her to return to what she</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had said about childhood. But then he also, after a pause, and as though against</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his will, went on where she left off:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"I had thought that only the cep was confined to the fringes of the woods,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but then I can't recognize a cep."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">More minutes passed. They were far from the children and quite alone. Va-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ren'ka felt her heart beating. She felt that she was turning red, then white, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">then red again.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To be the wife of a man like Koznyshev, after her situation in the household</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Mrs. Stahl, seemed to her like the peak of happiness. Besides, she was almost</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sure that she was in love with him. And now all this was to be decided. She</p>

  <p class="calibre1">felt frightened, frightened at what he might or might not say.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">His declaration had to be made now or never: so Sergej Ivanovich said to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">himself. Everything in her looks - her blush, her lowered eyelids - showed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Varen'ka's painful expectation. Sergej Ivanovich noticed it and pitied her. He</p>

  <p class="calibre1">also realized that if he said nothing, his silence would hurt her. Again he repeated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to himself all the reasons in favor of proposing, he repeated to himself the little</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speech that was to express his intentions. But instead, under some strange impulse,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he finally asked, "And what is then the difference between the cep and the birch-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom;"</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Varen'ka's lips trembled as she replied: "There is almost no difference in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cap. The difference is in the stem."</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And the instant she uttered those words, she knew and he knew that every-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thing was over, and that what ought to have been said would never be said.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Their tension, having reached its peak, began to subside.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"The birch-mushroom-its stem reminds one of a two-days' beard on a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">swarthy man," said Sergej Ivanovich, quite calmly.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">"You are quite right!" said Varen'ka, and she smiled. Without thinking they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">turned their steps back to the children. Varen'ka felt hurt and ashamed, and at</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same time a sense of relief came over her.</p>
