            <p><span class="initial">I</span>n the Middle Ages the French viewed the toad somewhat differently from the English, and in this section we shall digress briefly to clarify the distinction. With the French the emphasis was not directly on the venom but on the creature as an incarnation of Satan.</p>

            <p>In Old French there was a curious word,&#160;<i>le lot,</i>&#160;which according to the dictionaries meant &#8216;toad&#8217;, and they add that it fell into disuse in the 15th century. For a time it lingered on in a single phrase:&#160;<i>enfle comme une bote,</i>&#160;&#8216;blown up like a female toad&#8217;, a phrase that beyond the Loire had already become&#160;<i>enfle comme un crapault.</i>&#160;(The female is much bigger than the male, and the older simile thus carried a double superlative.)&#160;<i>Bot</i>&#160;in the sense of toad survives to this day in many regional dialects of France and also in the Italian&#160;<i>botta.</i>&#160;The word in a different meaning still circulates in standard French, in the fossilized term,&#160;<i>pied bot,</i>&#160;&#8216;club foot&#8217;. What links toads to club feet?</p>

            <p>The origin of this word is not in doubt.&#160;<i>Bot</i>&#160;comes down from a Germanic root meaning &#8216;blunted&#8217;, &#8216;malformed&#8217;, &#8216;clumsy&#8217;. It exists in an English form: the pudgy, clumsy hands of babies are &#8216;puds&#8217;, as are the forefeet of certain animals. &#8216;Puddifoot&#8217; is a family name, originally a nickname for a cripple. But why should a toad, with its delicately articulated extremities, be called a cripple?</p>

            <p>We believe that the history of this little word is a chronicle of successive metaphors, and that its primary role was as a euphemism for Satan. The Foul Fiend in the Middle Ages possessed certain sharply defined attributes. He wore horns. He had a tail. For hands he showed claws. He was enveloped in the hairy hide of an animal. He was sometimes represented as glorying in shameless priapism. Finally, he was a cripple, one leg ending either in a club foot, or a splayfoot, or a bird&#8217;s talons, or a paw, or a hoof &#8212;&#8203; a cloven hoof. To this day horns and cloven hoof are familiar metaphors for wickedness in English. There are low circles in which &#8216;cripple&#8217; serves as an epithet of singular viciousness, beyond anything that mere lameness justifies. Eric Partridge in his&#160;<i>Dictionary of Slang</i> cites what he calls a senseless phrase used by English schoolboys to spur their teammates to greater efforts: &#8220;Go it, you cripple!&#8221; Sometimes the language of children preserves words and phrases that have disappeared among adults, and we believe these schoolboys are in hopes that the very Devil will possess the players on their side. Perhaps our suggestion explains another folk belief that is still current, the notion that cripples are capable of more than normal sexual prowess.</p>

            <p> In the first instance, then,&#160;<i>le hot</i>&#160;meant &#8216;the Cripple&#8217;, a euphemism for Satan.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b3-fn1" id="cp5b3-r1">[1]</a></sup> In this sense it survived into the 16<sup>th</sup> century in the oath,&#160;<i>Vrai lot! &#8212;&#8203; </i>&#160;&#8216;by the very Devil&#8217;. Elizabethan England borrowed this French oath intact. The Oxford Dictionary gives as its earliest citation the following, dated 1584: &#8220;A bots on thy motley beard!&#8221;, and the final citation is from 1719:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Bots on them all Both<br />
                    great and small!</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Unaccountably, the Oxford Dictionary says the origin of &#8216;bots&#8217; is unknown.</p>

            <p>Satan&#8217;s sinister limp seems to have vanished today from men&#8217;s memories. It was vanishing already in Napoleon&#8217;s time. His coadjutor Talleyrand, notorious for his loose life and lack of scruples, limped from his earliest years; and this physical deformity did not escape his enemies, who dubbed him&#160;<i>le (liable boiteux,</i> &#8216;the limping devil&#8217;.&#160;<i>(Boiteux,</i>&#160;by the way, is unrelated etymologically to&#160;<i>le hot.)</i> In ear her times either the noun or the adjective would have been redundant. An English caricaturist devised a satirical coat of arms for Bonaparte, supported on either side by a Devil, on the right by the Corsican Devil with a cloven hoof, and on the left by Talleyrand, the French Devil, with a reptilian extremity. Was it not Talleyrand&#8217;s distinction to be the last major figure with a limp whose infirmity was held against him as a demonic stigma? We reproduce this savage print in our Plate No. XX.</p>

            <p> In the next stage,&#160;<i>le lot</i>&#160;underwent a shift from Satan himself to the creatures into which he was supposed to transform himself &#8212;&#8203; the toad, a certain kind of nocturnal bird, and bats.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b3-fn2" id="cp5b3-r2">[2]</a></sup> The nightjar, kin to the American whippoorwill, was known in parts of France up to recent times as&#160;<i>le hot volant,</i>&#160;and also as&#160;<i>le crapaud volant,</i>&#160;names so layered with metaphors that they could be fairly translated in any of three ways, the flying Devil, the flying Cripple, and the flying Toad. Even more interesting is the widespread use of&#160;<i>le hot volant</i>&#160;for the bat, a creature that was formerly steeped in sinister associations. Its nakedness, its blackness, its miraculous agility in night flight, its facial features stretched taut in a subhuman grimace, the strange profile of its wings with their articulated struts, its vampirish repute &#8212;&#8203; all these attributes caused it to be feared and loathed as the very Devil himself, and justified medieval man, in his own eyes, in putting bats to death, whenever caught, by methods of hideous cruelty, similar to the treatment accorded to toads.</p>

            <p>The English word &#8216;bat&#8217; for the flying rodent is first recorded in the year 1523. Formerly the creature had been a <i>bakke,</i> and philologists have been at a loss to explain the irregular mutation in its ending. Have they not been looking in the wrong direction? Surely Tudor England borrowed the new word &#8216;bat&#8217; from France, altering the vowel under the attraction of the native Middle English word. (The same vowel change was to take place shortly afterwards in God&#8217;s name: in the profanity of the iyth century &#8216;God&#8217; by a euphemistic mincing of the vowel became &#8216;Gad&#8217;.)</p>

            <p>&#8216;Old Boots&#8217; is one of the names by which the Devil has been known in English. Is it not a popular adaptation of &#8216;bots&#8217;? When Bella, in <i>Our Mutual Friend,</i> calls her husband a &#8216;Clumsy-Boots&#8217; <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b3-fn3" id="cp5b3-r3">[3]</a></sup>, is not Dickens, all unawares, recapturing for us a faint echo of the stumping Cripple&#8217;s awkward limp, now sugared down into a loving pet-name? Then there is Puss-in-Boots, <i>le Chat Botte,</i> the fairy tale that Charles Perrault first put on paper late in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, in which a cat displays superhuman acumen when shod in boots. Do we not detect here a punning echo, come down from much earlier, of the demonic Cripple&#8217;s prowess?</p>

            <p>Demonic possession connotes mental disturbance, and we think this is why &#8216;bat&#8217; in English, especially in slang, is linked with lunacy. &#8216;Bats&#8217; is a vulgar word for delirium tremens, and those who go &#8216;on a bat&#8217; indulge in wild behavior, while the man with &#8216;bats in the belfry&#8217; is quite &#8216;batty&#8217;. If we are right, all these words, full of vigor in the spoken language, stem back to <i>le bat,</i> the limping Arch Cripple.</p>

            <p>Satan today has degenerated into a pallid personification of evil. In the Middle Ages he was no abstraction, no mere Idea. He was hot flesh and blood. Miss Margaret A. Murray in her studies of witchcraft has shown that his bestial attributes &#8212;&#8203; the horns and hoof, the claws, hide, and tail &#8212;&#8203; were those of the celebrant in the nocturnal rites of the witches&#8217; coven, the rites belonging to the religion of the Horned God, as she calls this divinity, the autochthonous religion of Europe and the Near East which slowly gave ground before Christianity and on which in its expiring throes the triumphant enemy bestowed the condescending name of witchcraft. The master of the ceremonies was known to his followers by many names, such as Robin Goodfellow in England. On the tongues of his enemies in the Christian Church Militant he was Satan and the Devil, the Foul Fiend, the Seducer, he of the Horns and Cloven Hoof, <i>le Bot.</i> If Miss Murray is right, we are discussing a religion practiced by our ancestors for thousands of years, which expired just yesterday, and which we can now study only through the eyes of the Church that was its deadly foe, and through clues such as we are here discussing. It is not surprising that when Hieronymus Bosch painted his famous <i>Seven Deadly Sins,</i> the successive scenes swarm with toads, the incarnation of Satan, as well as other reptiles. We reproduce one of these vignettes, representing the sin of Pride or <i>Superbia,</i> with a peacock fittingly present. Satan in the shape of a great man-like toad holds up a mirror to the worldlings.</p>

            <p>In Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s reign, probably before 1588, there was published in England a poem entitled <i>The Mad Pranks and Merry jests of Robin Goodfelloiv,</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b3-fn4" id="cp5b3-r4">[4]</a></sup> It seems to have appeared in a long succession of editions, of which the earliest known to survive bears, we believe, the date 1628. The verses are of little worth, but they and the illustration that accompanies them are valuable as one of the few spontaneous expressions of the witchcraft cult emanating from within the circle of sympathizers. Here is the Horned God in proud panoply, <i>le Bot</i> in action. Here is Robin Goodfellow, Hob-goblin, Will the Wisp, Mad Crisp. No mushrooms appear in the woodcut that illustrates the 1639 edition, which we reproduce, but their presence offstage may be inferred, for we are told that Robin was sired by Oberon, whose fungal attachments we shall shortly point out. The witches of the coven are dancing in a &#8216;fairy ring&#8217;, but there is no evidence that these rings, where the grass grows differently, were linked with mushrooms before the 15<sup>th</sup> century. In the poem we learn that Oberon had been looking for his offspring high and low:</p>

            <blockquote>
                At last upon a summer&#8217;s night<br/>
                King Oberon found him out, And<br/>
                with his elves in dancing wise<br/>
                straight circled him about, The Fairies<br/>
                danc&#8217;t and little Tom Thumb<br/>
                on his bag-pipe did play And thus they<br/>
                danced their fairy round<br/>
                till almost break of day.<br/>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The artist who carved the woodcut, though crude in his technique, conveyed his message effectively. In the heavens fly two black birds, and he took sufficient pains for their silhouettes to be unmistakable. They are none other than nightjars, sometimes called goatsuckers or night ravens. These are the <i>lots volants</i> of evil augury, the sinister birds that held our ancestors in dread fascination:</p>

            <blockquote>
                &#8230; the night raven Which<br />
                doth use for to call Men to<br />
                Death&#8217;s haven.
            </blockquote>

            <p>The toad appears as a visual symbol of Satan and the pagan god in French iconography in the late Middle Ages. One of the most famous episodes in early French history was the conversion of King Clovis to the Christian faith. His wife Clotilde was a Christian, but he resisted the attractions of the new creed until he fought the battle of Tolbiac in the year 496. When the battle was going against him he swore that he would abandon the old religion if the Christian God would give him victory. The tide turned, and shortly thereafter he was baptized by St. Remi at Reims.</p>

            <p>In that city there survive a number of tapestries woven in the 15<sup>th</sup> and early 16<sup>th</sup> centuries that depict the life of King Clovis. They show him fighting at Tolbiac as a pagan clothed in a surcoat adorned with toads, under a standard bearing the heraldic emblem of toads. The creatures are pictured as from above, their legs spread-eagled. In the next scene, where St. Remi is giving instruction to the King, the heraldic toads vanish. In the third scene the king is baptized, while high above the font an escutcheon appears bearing fleurs de lis, as though to give a stamp of lofty approval to the happy event. Nearby a dove descends bearing the holy ampulla with the oil for the king&#8217;s anointing.</p>

            <p>Heraldic emblems did not come into use until about A.D. noo, and the tapestries in Reims are therefore an anachronism, a didactic invention of the Middle Ages.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b3-fn5" id="cp5b3-r5">[5]</a></sup> Toads never figured in the arms of any French king. But those who designed these tapestries were not guilty of mendacity. It was their purpose to convey a simple message to the unlettered laity, and how better could the conversion of King Clovis be taught through pictures than by showing the pagan king waging war under Satan&#8217;s banner? Here the symbols have come full circle: in the beginning the Foul Fiend was <i>le Bot</i>  &#8212;&#8203;  the Cripple  &#8212;&#8203;  and then this name jumped to the demonic toad, and now the toad, commonly known as <i>le. hot,</i> stands for the club-footed Fiend. Heraldic creatures are mythical at best, and here we have myth compounding myth, a legend about a symbol that never was. The belief in Clovis&#8217;s toads circulated chiefly among lowly and unlettered folk, &#8220;par le vulgaire et par le menu peuple&#8221;, and <i>le hot</i> flourished in the same milieu.</p>

            <p>We believe that we are the first to direct attention to the demonic multivalence of &#8216;the Cripple&#8217; in medieval France, but the evil emanations of toads are well known. Dirk Bax, for example, in his recent book on Hieronymus Bosch<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b3-fn6" id="cp5b3-r6">[6]</a></sup> points out their malign meaning for this painter. He reminds his readers of the old belief that witches could transform themselves into toads. He recalls the papal bull published in the year 1233 by Gregory IX wherein toads were called the symbols of the Devil and magic. He reports an episode in 1610 when a French <i>sorrier</i> discovered a cast in the left eye of a child, the cast taking the shape of a toad&#8217;s leg, and the child confessed that Satan had imprinted this <i>signum diabolicum</i> with his horn. According to an authority that Dr. Bax has found, St. Anthony beheld Satan in the shape of a toad with a human head, and if we accept the assertions of yet another writer, the toads in Hell torment the sinners, and in turn are food for the damned. To this day, Dr. Bax says, the Flemings believe that toads spit venom, just as Bosch shows us in <i>The Last Judgment.</i></p>

            <p>From Simin Palay&#8217;s recent dictionary of the dialects of Gascony and Beam we learn that in former days the Gascons spoke of a cast in the eye as a &#8216;toad&#8217; &#8212;&#8203; <i>crapaud</i> &#8212;&#8203; and considered it a distinctive sign of the witch and sorcerer. Here is that same <i>signum diabolicum</i> which Dr. Bax reported from a different source. A cast in the eye is a painless blemish, but it reminds us of the <i>paddescheet</i> of the Dutch, that stye, inflamed and stinging, which people call the toad&#8217;s excrement. Suddenly there dawns on us a lively and sinister meaning behind these faint folkloric hints linking toads with the human eye. In the days of the Old Religion in western and northern Europe, the toad gripped the imagination of our ancestors with a dread fascination such as the serpent has always exercised in the East and in India to this day. Yes, in cultural history the toad was the European equivalent of the serpent in the East. On its face strange, the folkloric link between toads and the human eye becomes clear if our surmise be right that the venom of the toad was deliberately used by the priests of the ancient cult to inflame the eyeballs, and thus heighten the awesome spell of the rites. Here may lie the reason why a genuine stye suggests the toad&#8217;s secretion, why the cast in someone&#8217;s eye was for the beholders the reminder and sign of demonic power.</p>

            <p>By now the reader may fairly ask what our discussion of Satan and <i>le hot</i> has to do with the problem of the toadstool. In brief, toads figure in both the English and the French fungal vocabulary, but the figure of speech in English emphasizes poison, whereas in French demonic possession plays the dominant role. In the former, the &#8216;toadstool&#8217; is a blanket malediction on all wild fungi, all of which are erroneously suspect as &#8216;poison-stools&#8217;. In the latter, the <i>crapaudin</i> (like the Basque <i>amoroto</i>) is the name for a particular species, and this species is not one of the deadly mushrooms. It is the amanita muscaria, the mushroom that intoxicates and exhilarates, that gives hallucinations. It is the mushroom of demonic possession. Bad as are both Satan and poison, there is a difference between the two. The whole world rejects poison, but Satan always has a goodly following. Unlike lethal poison, Satan is seductive. There is thus a distinction in the inner meaning between the toxic &#8216;toadstool&#8217; and the demonic <i>crapaudin.</i> The distinction is in the emphasis: the associations of the two terms overlap but do not coincide.</p>

            <p>If our interpretation of <i>le bot</i> is correct, why do we not find this word figuring in France&#8217;s fungal vocabulary? The answer is that we do. Eugene Rolland in his <i>Flore Populaire</i> reports <i>bo</i> as a designation for gilled mushrooms in the Haute Saone, and <i>botet</i> in the Loire. He gives no explanation for these words, whose inner meaning becomes obvious now for us. It would be well for specialists in French provincialisms to concentrate on <i>bo</i> and <i>botet,</i> to determine whether they still survive and where and with what precise fungal application and in what contexts. In the center and south of France there are regions where <i>boutarel, boutareu,</i> and <i>boutairoual</i> are general words for &#8216;mushroom&#8217;. They also mean in the langue d&#8217;oc &#8216;barrel&#8217; and &#8216;basket&#8217;, but we suspect that in the sense of &#8216;mushroom&#8217; they are a popular corruption of <i>boterel,</i> a diminutive of <i>le bot</i> that is not uncommon in France as a family name. A close scrutiny of the French dialects will certainly uncover additional links, until now unnoticed by scholars, between toads and mushrooms. On page 73 we mentioned the Gallic word for &#8216;toad&#8217;, <i>craxantus,</i> obsolete these many centuries. Does it perhaps survive in the Gascon name used for the despised and rejected boleti whose flesh turns blue on exposure to air &#8212;&#8203; <i>craaue-maudit,</i> which would then mean &#8216;the cursed toad&#8217;?</p>

            <p>We conclude, then, that mushrooms and toads were linked together in France in former times as part of a cluster of folk beliefs having a demonic nucleus. The link was strongest, it seems, north of the Loire and faded out as one approached the Mediterranean. Apparently it stemmed from the Germanic or Celtic cultural strata that antedated Mediterranean influences, strata steeped in the blackest mycophobia. And this leads vis again to Hieronymus Bosch.</p>

            <p>One of Bosch&#8217;s powerful paintings is the <i>Hay Wain,</i> to be seen in the Prado. It is a large triptych, and in the central panel, almost unremarked hitherto by commentators, there stands forth a giant boletus. So far as our inquiries have gone, this mushroom was the first significant representation of a fungus<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b3-fn7" id="cp5b3-r7">[7]</a></sup> after the ancient fresco of Herculaneum (which we reproduce on Plate LXXVI), a lapse of more than fourteen centuries. Let us see if we can arrive at the meaning of this extraordinary mushroom, so boldly painted, at first glance so enigmatic.</p>

            <p>The <i>Hay Wains</i> left-hand panel, of which we reproduce the upper part on Plate XXXVI, depicts with idyllic beauty the momentous events that took place in Paradise in the Beginning, up through the final scene where the Angel of the Lord drives Adam and Eve forth from Eden into the wilderness. The right-hand panel depicts Hell. The central panel is occupied chiefly by a huge load of hay, which is the dominating feature of a procession that enters the scene from Paradise on the left and disappears on the right heading for Hell. The wagon is being hauled by a miscellany of grotesque creatures who are personifications of the Sins. With a dead switch the Devil in the foreground drives on these monsters. The withered branch, as always in Bosch&#8217;s symbolism, signifies cursed sterility, recalling the withered vine of Christ&#8217;s homily. Sceptred king and mitred churchmen with their trains follow the hay-wagon, which as it progresses crushes little men like a juggernaut. Jesus looks down in anguish from Heaven, and a strange group of merry-makers disport themselves a-top the hay.</p>

            <p>The hay wain represents pleasure, but it remained for Mr. and Mrs. Nicolas Galas of New York, in the course of their studies of Bosch, to discover the precise text that is illustrated, a passage in a book with which Bosch was familiar, Gregory the Great&#8217;s <i>Morals on the Book of Job,</i> written after A.D. 600. In Book 32, paragraph 7, Gregory is commenting on the Vulgate text of Job 40: 4 (King James Version, Job 40: 9):</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>As he says by the Prophet, &#8216;Behold, I will shriek over you, as a cart creaketh laden with hay&#8217; [Amos 2: 13], for since the life of the carnal is hay, as it is written &#8216;All flesh is hay&#8217; [Isaiah 40: 6], in that the Lord endures the life of the carnal, he declares that he carries hay as a cart. And to creak under the weight of the hay is for Him to bear, with murmuring, the burdens and iniquities of sinners. [Vot. 3, Part 2, p. 514, of the English translation by J. H. Parker et al., published in Oxford, 1844-1850]</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>On the right in front of the wagon the great procession is joined by a small confluent stream of people pouring from a door-way as the hay-wagon approaches their earthly abode. They too are damned souls, as is declared by their leader&#8217;s reaching up for carnal hay on the wagon, and by another branch, withered and cursed, that holds up the trapdoor of the habitation out of which this secondary stream emerges. In the door can be seen the peephole used by the inmates when the door is closed. In our opinion the doorway gives access, not to a cave, but to a turf-covered dwelling, of which the roof rises to a clearly identifiable peak, made by the upright post that is presumably the structural support for the primitive structure. On the left of that peak there lies a fruit, symbol of man&#8217;s First Fall. On the right stands our mushroom. Bosch has painted not a mushroom, but a gigantic effigy, a mushroom sculptured in stone or wood. It represents a boletus, perhaps the boletus satanas, a species that to this day is popularly associated with Satan in Central Europe. The light color of the painted mushroom effigy is not significant, for it is the color of the material in which the mushroom is sculptured. The stem is covered with flecks like goose-flesh. The cap is disproportionately small, and from it emerges again the withered branch of the Biblical curse.</p>

            <p>We have seen that in 16<sup>th</sup> century France mushrooms were called <i>pain de crapault,</i> &#8216;toad&#8217;s bread&#8217;, a term that has been reported in modern times in Normandy. Contemporaneously, at the time of the Renaissance, the corresponding name in Flemish and Dutch was <i>duivelsbrood</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b3-fn8" id="cp5b3-r8">[8]</a></sup>, &#8216;devil&#8217;s bread&#8217;, a term now obsolete in the standard language, but historically documented in the larger Dutch and Flemish dictionaries. These two expressions, &#8216;toad&#8217;s bread&#8217; and &#8216;devil&#8217;s bread&#8217;, superficially using different metaphors, are in essence perfect translations one of the other, for as we have seen &#8216;toad&#8217; and &#8216;devil&#8217; are synonyms. The effigy of a mushroom that Bosch the Dutchman painted was the effigy of the Devil&#8217;s Bread, and the people who lived at the Sign of the Devil&#8217;s Bread were bread for the Devil.</p>

            <p>Our mushroom effigy is then a pictographic embodiment of a popular metaphor, and proclaims the curse that lies on the household dwelling within. This interpretation receives surprising support from an otherwise inexplicable detail of the painting. The base of the mushroom shows two flattened surfaces. Bread always bears the imprint of the vessel in which it is baked, and here we discover the beveled faces left by the Devil&#8217;s bread-pan. How obvious this must have been for Bosch&#8217;s neighbors in the Low Countries!</p>

            <p>There remains a crucial question: why did Bosch introduce into this sermon in paint the minor tributary stream of Hell-bent sinners, emerging from the House of the Devil&#8217;s Bread? Clearly this rather crowded detail of his exhortation on the carnal sins was not a capricious fancy. He was asserting something, but what; Here is our conjecture. The main stream of sinners is recruited from the Christian community, as evidenced by the trappings of the leaders. The tributary stream is fed by folk similarly damned but who have not belonged to the Christian fold. The Devil is the hot-blooded Devil of the witches&#8217; covens. The people crowding forth from the hovel do not lend themselves to a precise count but they are about thirteen, the full complement of a witches&#8217; coven with their leader the Devil, whom we may perhaps distinguish in this group. Here are then the &#8216;fairy folk&#8217;, who were wont to dwell in the remote and desert places and who paid no obeisance to Pope or Christ. They were described in vivid detail by the Swedish writer Olaus Magnus, whose <i>Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus</i> appeared in 1555 in Rome<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b3-fn9" id="cp5b3-r9">[9]</a></sup>, a generation after Bosch&#8217;s death. The fairy folk dwelt in houses walled and roofed with turf, the roof being supported by a central post. A woodcut in Olaus Magnus shows the Swedish King Hotherus paying a visit on the fairy people and we reproduce it here, for we suggest that the house painted by Bosch springs from the same folk beliefs as the houses in the Magnus woodcut a half century later. Miss Margaret A. Murray may be right that a culturally distinct people, autochthonous, unlettered, and pagan, lived side by side with the Christian world in northern Europe down into Renaissance times. But whether that people existed or not, the belief in them existed and was generally accepted, and Bosch presents those cursed outcasts to us under the Sign of the Devil&#8217;s Bread, a sinister and mycophobic Sign that marks for us the initial emergence of the mushroom world into the documentary annals of northern Europe.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b3-fn10" id="cp5b3-r10">[10]</a></sup></p>

            <p>For the medieval world the fairies were sinister beings, at least in orthodox eyes, and down to recent times the flavor of the old belief could still be detected in Sussex, where &#8216;fairy rings&#8217; long continued to be called &#8216;hag tracks&#8217;. By the end of the 16<sup>th</sup> century the fairies had become the dulcified sprites of modern usage and this transformation has been attributed to the imposing genius of gentle Shakespere. But the time has come to take new soundings in the social upheavals of that troubled 16<sup>th</sup> century. The Reformation turned society upside down and inside out, and perhaps layers of the community, formerly inarticulate, where the fairies had always been beloved rose to the top and through Shakespere and others made their voices heard.</p>

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b3-fn1">A parallel for&#160;<i>hot</i>&#160;is to be found perhaps in&#160;<i>bratze,</i>&#160;a colloquial name for the toad reported in Bavaria, which can mean &#8216;paw&#8217;, &#8216;claw&#8217;, &#8216;clumsy foot&#8217;. But&#160;<i>bratze</i>&#160;must be considered in conjunction with certain other words for the toad: Bavarian&#160;<i>braste,</i>&#160;suggestive of the lamenting cry of the toad; the Bavarian&#160;<i>broz</i>&#160;and the Austrian <i>brotze</i>&#160;and&#160;<i>braitling,</i>&#160;these relating to the swelling of the toad.&#160;<a href="#cp5b3-r1">&#8617;</a></li>

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b3-fn2">It is permissible to conjecture that the Germanic etymon of&#160;<i>hot,</i>&#160;in the sense of a rough lump, attached itself directly to the toad, rather than through the mediation of Satan. There might even be a kinship with the Dutch <i>padde,</i>&#160;the English &#8216;pad&#8217; and &#8216;paddock&#8217;. But the application of the word to the nightjar and to bats is proof that in France in the Middle Ages the idea of Satan was uppermost.&#160;<a href="#cp5b3-r2">&#8617;</a></li>

Leber quotes from Scevole de Sainte-Marthe (1572&#8211;&#8203;1650), and the evidence indicates that the popular belief in the heraldic toads of the pagan French kings goes back at least to the beginning of the 15<sup>th</sup> century. From the 16<sup>th</sup> century to the 18<sup>th</sup> we find in both English and French sources frequent references to Clovis&#8217;s heraldic toads.

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b3-fn7">The <i>Bulletin</i> of the Societe Mycologique de France in 1911 (vol. xxvii, p. 31) announced to the mycological world the discovery of a 13<sup>th</sup> century fresco representing the temptation of Eve. The mycologists who focused their attention on this fresco persuaded themselves that the Tree of Good and Evil had been portrayed by the artist as an amanita muscaria. The fresco, which we visited in the summer of 1952, is in a disaffected chapel in France, in the Berry, between Ingrandes and Merigny, near the Chateau de Plaincourault. The style is Romanesque, and this fits the date that the edifice bears &#8212;&#8203; 1291. Since the initial announcement there have been numerous references to the fresco in mycological publications; e.g., <i>The Romance of the Fungus World,</i> by R. T. and F. W. Rolfe, London, 1925, p. 291; also John Ramsbottom&#8217;s <i>Mushrooms &amp; Toadstools,</i> pp. 46&#8211;&#8203;7 and illustration facing p. 34; also <i>The Illustrated London News,</i> Nov. 21, 1953. The mycologists would have done well to consult art historians. The Plaincourault fresco does not represent a mushroom and has no place in a discussion of ethno-mycology. It is a typical stylized Palestinian tree, of the type familiar to students of Byzantine and Romanesque art. The German art historians have even devised for this oft-repeated motif the technical designation of <i>Pilzbaum.</i>&#160;<a href="#cp5b3-r7">&#8617;</a></li>

                <li epub:type="footnote" id="cp5b3-fn10">The mushroom in the <i>Hay Wain</i> is not the only one painted by Bosch. In his ghostly portrayal of The World, strangely disturbing, on the back of the wings of the <i>Garden of Delights,</i> there are two unmistakable mushrooms, possibly three, all in the left-hand panel. Elsewhere we find shapes that suggest mushrooms, perhaps intended by Bosch to do so; e.g., one such shape in the left-hand panel of the <i>Garden of Delights</i> and two in the central panel, the table in the <i>Cure for Folly,</i> and various &#8216;puckfist&#8217; shapes elsewhere. The demonic symbolism of the toadstool may have played an important and hitherto unsuspected role in Bosch&#8217;s cosmos.&#160;<a href="#cp5b3-r10">&#8617;</a></li>
