      <p><span class="initial">J</span>ust as we turned to the Breton word&#160;<i>tousec</i>&#160;for a clue to the inner meaning of &#8216;toadstool&#8217;, so now we invite our readers to look with us at the Low German&#160;word&#160;<i>pogge</i>,&#160;meaning frog or toad, and&#160;<i>poggenstohl</i>,&#160;&#8216;frogstool&#8217;.&#160;<i>Pogge</i>&#160;exists in&#160;many a dialectical variant:&#160;<i>pogg, pagg, pugg, puck, pook, pauk, poch</i>,&#160;and&#160;<i>puch.</i></p>

      <p>One of the daring labors of modern philologists has been the reconstruction of the original Indo-European roots that lie behind our modern vocabularies. With the known vocabularies of some scores of languages, living and dead, to go by, they work back along converging lines of evolution to discover, as closely as the evidence permits, the roots that were current perhaps four thousand years ago, before the linguistic unity of our ancestors broke up. These reconstructed roots cannot of course be tested against actual usage, nor is it remotely possibleto document the history of their verbal progeny back to them in a way that would constitute proof by the exacting standards of the etymological discipline. It is also true that different philologists working from the same evidence arrive sometimes at different reconstructions of the root, but often there is a consensus, and even if we consider the results only tentative and approximate, these hypothetical Indo-European roots serve, if cautiously used, to associate together significantly large clusters of words. The philologist of our time who has devoted his life to this work is Julius Pokorny. In his latest revision of his&#160;<i>IndogermanischesEtymologischesWorterbuch</i>&#160;he presents an important root that he represents thus: b(e)u-, bh(e)ŭ-. It means to swell up, to puff up, to fill with wind, to inflate or expand or distend, and in origin it is imitative.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b4-fn1" id="cp5b4-r1">[1]</a></sup></p>

      <p>Among the many words that Pokorny traces to this root is our Low German <i>pogge</i>,&#160;meaning frog or toad, and the semantic link here is clear. Of the aspects that the frog or toad presents to the human senses, two stand out, one aural and the other visual: the croak, and the astonishing distension of the creature with air in the act of croaking. A frog or toad suggests the idea of a sac that lends itself to gaseous <a name="distension-1">distension</a>. From Pokorny&#8217;s root we derive also our English &#8216;poke&#8217;, meaning a <a name="bag-1">bag</a>, and &#8216;<a name="pocket-1">pocket</a>&#8217;, and the French&#160;<i>poche.</i>&#160;To the same family belongs the Anglo-Saxon&#160;<i>būc</i>,&#160;meaning &#8216;<a name="belly-1">belly</a>&#8217; and also any bellied container such as a <a name="pitcher-1">pitcher</a>. To these we would venture to add a curious trio of English words, the obsolete &#8216;pung&#8217; and &#8216;bung&#8217; and the Scottish &#8216;spung&#8217;, all three meaning &#8216;<a name="purse">purse</a>&#8217;, words that picked up somewhere along the road a nasal infix, as the philologists say. In Swedish&#160;<i>pung</i>,&#160;meaning &#8216;<a name="pouch-3">pouch</a>&#8217;, is in current use.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b4-fn2" id="cp5b4-r2">[2]</a></sup></p> <p>There exists, we believe, abundant evidence that latent&#160;<i>inpogge</i>&#160;is the metaphor of an inflatable sac. In the eastern part of the Dutch province of Gelderland, the same word&#160;<i>pogge</i>&#160;means, not a frog, but a young pig, a creature notorious for its fat rotundity.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b4-fn3" id="cp5b4-r3">[3]</a></sup> The same figure of speech underlies the words for &#8216;toad&#8217; in other languages. Thus&#160;<i>bufo</i>&#160;in Latin suggests the blown-up cheeks of the <a name="buffoon">buffoon</a>. In ancient Greek a kind of toad that was said to puff itself up to bursting and to exhale a poisonous breath was the φύσα&#771;λος, a word derived from φύσα, meaning a <a name="bellows-1">bellows</a>, a wind, a blast, a breath; and it is related to a Greek word for <a name="bladder-1">bladder</a> and <a name="bubble-1">bubble</a>. In the Tosk dialect of Albanian, a toad is a&#160;<i>thithëlopë</i>,&#160;or &#8216;<a name="udder-1">cow&#8217;s udder</a>&#8217;,&#160;<i>thithë-</i>&#160;being the udder. The inflated pouch of a toad suggests an udder.</p>
      
      <p>Now we turn to the Irish language, and here our wild fungi re-enter the scene in a strange blending of metaphors already familiar to us. In Irish there are two words for a bag or pouch,&#160;<i>bolg</i>,&#160;which is related to the Latin&#160;<i>bulga</i>, and&#160;<i>púca</i>,&#160;which was probably borrowed between A.D. 800 and 1050 from Scandinavian sources. They are two further examples of words belonging to the family of our familiar Pokorny root. In Irish one way to refer to a wild fungus is&#160;<i>bolg losgainn</i>,&#160;literally &#8216;frog&#8217;s pouch&#8217;, and another&#160;<i>wayis púcan beireach</i>, &#8216;<a name="heifers-pouch">heifer&#8217;s pouch</a>&#8217;. If the &#8216;heifer&#8217;s pouch&#8217; refers to the udder, as we suppose, the same figure of speech that in Albanian means &#8216;toad&#8217; turns up in Irish meaning &#8216;toadstool&#8217;. In Irish,&#160;<i>bolg séidte</i>,&#160;&#8216;blown-up bag&#8217;, is a term for the <a name="puffball-1">puffball</a>. It is easy to see why the fungi figure in all these metaphors: puffballs, toadstools, all the wild fungi of forest and field, impress the visual sense as creatures that quickly swell up.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b4-fn4" id="cp5b4-r4">[4]</a></sup> Francis Bacon in his&#160;<i>Sylva Sylvarum</i>&#160;described the puffball as a &#8216;cod, or bag&#8217;; in Bacon&#8217;s time &#8216;cod&#8217; meant both &#8216;pouch&#8217; and &#8216;scrotum&#8217;. In Latin&#160;<i>bulga</i>&#160;was a humorous metaphor for the <a name="womb-1">womb</a>, and the <a name="bagpipe">bagpipe</a> down through Renaissance times was a symbol of lust and wantonness.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b4-fn5" id="cp5b4-r5">[5]</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>In Slavic our Pokorny root erupts directly in to the fungal vocabulary. An ancient word for &#8216;mushroom&#8217; survives in the Czech <i><a name="bedla">bedla</a></i>, in the Polish <i>bedła</i>, and in <i>blitza</i>, a term reported in certain parts of Russia. From these words Roman Jakobson reconstructs the hypothetical <i>bŭ-dla</i> for primitive Slavic, descended in its turn from our Indo-European root, with the addition of the Slavic instrumental suffix <i>-dl-</i>. The philologists link these Slavic words with an Indie word meaning &#8216;<a name="bubble-2">bubble</a>&#8217;, wherein the idea of the swelling sac recurs in purest form.</p>

      <p>We have pursued our Low German <i>pogge</i> on the humble and earthy level of toads and frogs, udders, bags, and fungi. But the underlying metaphor, keyed to gaseous distension and gaseous collapse, lends itself to images on a wholly different plane, and our same Indo-European root proliferated verbal progeny in the incorporeal world, the world of imps, sprites, and goblins. Here we find our &#8216;spooks&#8217;, and Shakespere&#8217;s <a name="puck-1">Puck</a>, and Kipling&#8217;s &#8216;<i>Puck</i> of <i>Pook&#8217;s</i> Hill&#8217;, malicious forces of the unseen world, unaccountable, like Hamlet&#8217;s ghost <i>hie et ubique</i>, the bugbears and bugaboos of cowering minds. In Irish, <i>púca</i> circulates as two distinct words, meaning &#8216;bag&#8217; and &#8216;sprite&#8217;, though in our opinion they are etymologically and metaphorically identical. The Pooka of Mary Chase&#8217;s play <i>Harvey</i> is a wise but mischievous spirit, an imaginary rabbit blown up to more than human size. In English &#8216;puck&#8217; refers only to imps, but here, as in Irish, we find it associated with the fungal world, for &#8216;<a name="puckfist-2">puckfist</a>&#8217;, now fallen into disuse, was once a common name for the puff ball. The second element in the word, &#8216;-fist&#8217;, meant a silent expulsion of hind wind, and so a puffball was an imp&#8217;s <a name="flatus-1">flatus</a>. In Russian a &#8216;flatus&#8217; is a <i>puk</i>, riming with juke&#8217;, and the word is another of our <i>pogge</i> cluster intimately linked with a family of Russian words relating to gaseous distension, swelling, bursting, ripping open; but the Russian word is not associated with fungi or amphibians.</p>

      <p>Like the weaver&#8217;s threads shuttling in and out in warp and woof, we have seen how words and meanings play hide-and-seek: frogs and toads are inflatable sacs, and these are sprites, and bags and sprites are fungi. Today the meanings are compartmented, their latent metaphors forgotten. But there was a time when the metaphors were living, the words fluid. We have said that &#8216;puckfist&#8217;, referring to a puffball, meant an imp&#8217;s flatus. Did it once, long ago, mean &#8216;toad&#8217;s flatus&#8217;? There is no evidence in surviving English documents for this. Yet we know that the toad was the <a name="demonic-possession-2">habitation of the Evil One</a>. We know that in the southwest of England toadstools to this day are called &#8216;<a name="pixie-stool-1">pixie-stools</a>&#8217;, with a puckish <a name="pixie-1">pixie</a> thus doing service for the toad.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b4-fn6" id="cp5b4-r6">[1]</a></sup> We know more: the language closest to English is Frisian, and in the dialect of Frisian spoken on the island of Terschelling the puff ball is called the <i>podde-fyst</i>, toad&#8217;s flatus, and in the neighboring island of Schiermonnikoog it is the <i>pare-pûster</i>, toad&#8217;s puff. But the association with imps is also not absent from Frisian, for in the town of Dokkum the puffball is called the <i>spoekebal</i>, or &#8216;spookball&#8217;. With what regularity the semantic themes recur! In German we face a pretty problem: the puffball is the <i>Bovist</i> or <i>Bofist</i>, and in Low German we find <i>pofist</i>: the second syllable in these words is clear, but what idea hides behind the first syllable? No one knows, but we think it is safe to assume that it meant either frog or toad, or an imp, or a sac, or a puff, or a blending of these. And whichever it was, behind it lay the primal idea of a gaseous swelling, an exhalation; and emotionally, all of these terms connoted something vile.</p>

      <p>In the first stage of our &#8216;toadstool&#8217; pilgrimage, we identified what we call the poison-cluster of toad and fungal words. Now we have gone on to identify the <i>pogge</i>-cluster, wherein, through the mediation of the evil spirit with which both toads and fungi were felt to be instinct, we find these lowly creatures linked together verbally in the untutored minds of early men inhabiting the dank forests of northern Europe from Ireland to Russia. Here we discern the deep folk associations that caused and expressed the mycophobia of the Celtic and Germanic peoples. In the Mediterranean world, a kindred idea of the breath, the exhalation, gave rise to metaphors of the loftiest associations &#8212;&#8203; the Holy &#8216;Spirit&#8217; and Divine In<i>spir</i>ation. In Russia the word for the soul &#8212;&#8203; <i>dushá</i> &#8212;&#8203; flows from <i>dukh</i>, the word for breath. But by an initial turning in the wrong direction, the metaphorical use of gaseous distension and exhalation in the world north of the Alps reduced the Holy Spirit to a sprite, and the Divine Afflatus into an imp&#8217;s flatus. The northern metaphor was keyed to frogs and toads, and they to swollen fungi, and both to the Devil.</p>

      <p>Earlier we saw how toads and fungi and venom executed a kind of triangular measure in the minds and words of the peoples who dwelt on the shores of the North Sea. Against the vaster background of a still more ancient world, we have seen how a common idea underlay the words for things as disparate as toads, sacs, fungi, and imps, and how meanings and metaphors criss-crossed in the figures of an antique quadrille. The poison-cluster of words was super-imposed, so to speak on the <i>pogge</i>-cluster. In France the toad and the Devil coalesce, with fungi joining the company.</p>

      <p>We have seen that an Irish expression for the mushroom is the frog&#8217;s pouch, <i>bolg losgainn</i>. <i>Bolg</i> is cousin to the English words &#8216;<a name="belly-2">belly</a>&#8217;, &#8216;bulge&#8217;, and &#8216;bilge&#8217;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b4-fn7" id="cp5b4-r7">[7]</a></sup> (&#8216;Bilge&#8217; is the ship&#8217;s belly where bilge-water collects.)&#160;<i>Bolg</i>&#160;also means belly or <a name="womb-2">womb</a>, <a name="bag-2">bag</a> or pouch or pocket, <a name="bellows-2">bellows</a>, <a name="bladder-2">bladder</a>, <a name="pimple-1">pimple</a>, <a name="blister">blister</a>. It is kin to the Latin&#160;<i>bulga</i>,&#160;which meant a leathern pouch or reticule (in lieu of the pockets that the Romans did not have) carried over the forearm, a word that the second century lexicographer Festus traced to an origin in Gaul. It is the same word as the French&#160;<i>bouge</i>,&#160;which has had a succession of meanings down the centuries &#8212;&#8203; a concavity, a dump, a miserable habitation, the belly of a cask, a leathern bag, a valise. Another word of the same clan is &#8216;budget&#8217;, that most distended of all wallets, always &#8216;bulging&#8217;.</p>

 <p>If, as we have seen, frogs and toads were often called &#8216;pouches&#8217; or &#8216;bags&#8217;, then by a reverse semantic transfer, we might discover that on occasions some word for &#8216;toad&#8217; that had no semantic or etymological kinship with the&#160;<i>pogge</i>-cluster might be used for a pouch or wallet. The word for pocket in High German today is&#160;<i>Tasche</i>,&#160;and we can trace it back to Old High German&#160;<i>tasca</i>,&#160;where the trail is lost. The Italian&#160;<i>tasca</i>&#160;means a pouch or wallet. Some have considered the Italian word distinct from the German, but no satisfactory etymology has been found for it either. We now put to the philologists the question whether both the German and the Italian words are not simply our old friend&#160;<i>tosca</i>, the Anglo-Saxon word for toad. We are not obliged to assume that&#160;<i>tosca</i>&#160;or <i>tasca</i>&#160;in the sense of toad was ever current in Old High German: it could have been borrowed in the Old High German period (not earlier than about A.D. 800) from some other area where&#160;<i>tasca</i>,&#160;meaning toad, had already taken on as a second meaning the sense of&#160;<i>bulga</i>&#160;or wallet. Nor was it borrowed necessarily from Anglo-Saxon, of course, since the area where this word circulated in various forms was much more extensive; just how extensive we do not know. There could have been, for a time, a style of&#160;<i>bulga</i>&#160; &#8212;&#8203; a leathern scrip hanging from the forearm &#8212;&#8203; designed to imitate a toad, and a term that began as a nonce-word could have struck permanent root in Germany and Italy.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b4-fn8" id="cp5b4-r8">[8]</a></sup></p>

Furthermore, the principal mean ing&#160;<i>of pogge</i>&#160;is &#8216;frog&#8217;, and the common frogs of Central Europe, unlike toads, are free of warts and pustules.

Our suggested etymology might be valid for Italian&#160;<i>tasca</i> even if invalid for the Old High German word. This brings us to an obstacle in the way of our theory that philologists will quickly bring up. The authorities cite an Old Saxon word&#160;<i>dasga</i>&#160;meaning &#8216;pocket&#8217;. This would correspond by normal transition to Old High German&#160;<i>tasca</i>,&#160;and the pair of words would point to a purely Teutonic root.
