        </header>
        
        <section class="main" epub:type="bodymatter chapter">
            <p><span class="initial">I</span>n the course of these pages we have often spoken of the different emotional attitudes toward wild mushrooms that mark the members of the European family of peoples. Heirs of a common Indo-European culture, sharing the same linguistic heritage and folklore, their diversity of response to the fungi is amazing, and, we must admit, baffling. Our information is insufficient in extent and precision for the compilation of a <i><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carte mycophagique</span></i> of Europe. But by pulling together the threads of evidence available to us we may suggest what such a map would show, and draw attention to the curious traits that compose the mycophobic syndrome.</p>

            <p>In the first place, the feelings of a people for wild mushrooms are unrelated to the supply. Wonderful mushrooms are abundant in both Norway and Muscovy, but the mushroom lore of the Norwegians is poor. The Portuguese are almost as steeped in mycophobia as their neighbors in Castile, though Portugal is by comparison rich in fungi. The Catalans live next door to the mycophobic Spaniards, and yet the Catalans are to be numbered amongpst those rare peoples whose folk knowledge of the wild mushrooms is breath-taking in range and subtlety. But perhaps the classic illustration of the point we are making is to be found outside Europe.</p>

            <p>The Arabian desert is not a land that mushroom-eaters would think to visit on pilgrimage; nonetheless, we discover that the Bedouin are passionate mycophiles. An authority on the Arabian nomads, Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, mentions this repeatedly in his admirable work on <i>The Arab of the Desert,</i> and in a letter to us he has nobly developed the theme. While the Arab eats various kinds of mushrooms with relish, the desert &#8216;truffles&#8217; are his favorites. These fungal growths, which never emerge to the surface of the earth, are usually called &#8216;truffles&#8217; by Europeans, but in fact they belong to a different genus, the terfezia. From classical times they have been esteemed in northern Africa, and in the market of Damascus they are sold in quantity under the local name of <i>kame.</i></p>

            <p>According to Colonel Dickson, scattered over Northeast Arabia, on Bahrain Island, and in the Qatar peninsula, there are spots well known to the Arabs where terfezia grow, always in the company of the rug-rug bush, known to science as the helianthemum Lippi. The Arab cannot count on his mushrooms. He keeps on the lookout for heavy rainfalls in the <i>wasm</i> season, which corresponds to our October, and if the rains then are heavy, and if they are accompanied by thunder and lightning, and especially if the rains recur throughout winter and spring, then the Arab knows the year will be good for mushrooms. When the conditions are propitious, in February and March the black-tent folk strike their tents, and journey to the familiar places, and then the women and children go forth early in the morning for the sunrise, or late in the day for sunset; and the shepherd boys, out with their flocks, are on the lookout too. For as the slanting rays of the twilight sun streak across the horizontal earth, the practiced eyes of the women and children detect the slight shadows cast by the monticules that the swelling terfezia are pushing up. During the spring months of a good year, these growths are as satisfying as meat to the Bedouin. He eats them roasted in hot ashes and dipped in salt, or fried slightly (after soaking in water with a pinch of salt) in clarified or fresh butter. The Arab women also slice them and dry them in the sun, and then keep them for eating in summer, or even for years as a food reserve. There are two kinds of these terfezia known to Colonel Dickson, the white <i>zobaidi,</i> which are the best, and the <i>khlas,</i> smaller, brown, and less tasty.</p>

            <p>Europe is sharply polarized, mycophagously speaking. At opposing ends of the Continent there are two areas where the folk knowledge about mushrooms is prodigious, sometimes truer than the manuals, and where the affection for them is wide and deep. There are also two areas of Europe, poles apart, where mushrooms are generally ignored or loathed. In between are all the other peoples, with varying degrees of knowledge and subtle gradations of feeling.</p>

            <p>The Great Russians are a mycolatrous folk, and of this some readers will consider our book manifest proof. The Poles, the Slovaks, and the Czechs are ardent mycophiles, and are sure to resent as an impudent and even imperialistic pretension my view that the Great Russians are in a class by themselves in this respect. I have never heard a contemptuous remark about mushrooms from a Great Russian; I recall none in our literature. But on an earlier page we have seen what Poland&#8217;s greatest poet says. The Czechs know their mushrooms like few others; but why are they in deadly dread of the boletus satanas? This is a mushroom that, properly cooked, strong stomachs can tolerate; yet the Czechs shun it like the deadly amanita. Our neighbors the Lithuanians are great mushroom eaters. I do not know enough about them to give them a rating. Is their appetite for mushrooms indigenous or borrowed from the Slavs? Here is a pretty problem to be coolly considered. It is certain that the interest in mushrooms among the Slavs slides off as one goes South. The Ukranians show less interest, and the Balkan Slavs are almost apathetic; it is said that the monastic clergy in Rumania and the other Balkan countries maintain a mycophagous tradition well above the level of the surrounding peasantry.</p>

            <p>The Finns present an interesting pattern. By tradition mycophobes, they still reject most mushrooms. But over much of the country they have learned from the Russians to eat lactarii, and in Carelia, where Russians used to go on vacations, they know and love many species. In the south-west there is a small area where only the chanterelle is eaten &#8212;&#8203; clearly a cultural emanation from Sweden.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b18-fn1" id="cp5b18-r1">[1]</a></sup></p>

            <p>The focus of mycophagy in the West lies in that stretch of Mediterranean littoral which embraces Catalonia and the Provence. In what is perhaps the best list of vernacular names for mushrooms ever assembled, the Catalan savants Joaquim Codina and P. Font Quer brought together a vocabulary of about 220 words, all of them genuine, identified with the localities where they were heard.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b18-fn2" id="cp5b18-r2">[2]</a></sup> The country folk of Provence are similarly proficient in mushroomic lore. Whether this intensive mycophilic knowledge prevails west of the Rhone and in Roussillon, thus linking Provence with Catalonia, we do not know.</p>

            <p>Just as Muscovy and Catalonia may be taken as the citadels of mycophagy, so as to mycophobia the foci of infection are found on the one hand among the Celts and Frisians along the shores of the Atlantic and the North Sea, and on the other hand in Greece. The Greeks have always been mycophobes. All of the early Greek poets &#8212;&#8203; Homer through the dramatists &#8212;&#8203; ignore the mushrooms. The earliest references to them are in the fifth century, and, as is fitting in a mycophobic world, both refer to poisonings.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b18-fn3" id="cp5b18-r3">[3]</a></sup> Next we encounter Nikander of Colophon, the didactic poet of the 2<sup>nd</sup> century B.C. whom we have already cited. In his <i>Alexipharmaca</i> he speaks thus of the mushroom tribe:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Let not the evil ferment of the soil injure a man; it will often swell up in his chest, at other times it will choke him, when it is fostered over the viper&#8217;s coil deep in its lair, sucking up the monster&#8217;s venom and the noxious breath from its moutn. This is the evil ferment which they call Fungi in general. [Quoted by courtesy of Cambridge University Press from translation by A. S. F. Gow and A. F. Scholfield]</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>From beginning to end in the writings of the ancient Greeks we find not one enthusiastic word for mushrooms. Even Athenaeus, that addict to the fleshpots whose lengthy writings give us an invaluable picture of daily life in ancient Greece, was no friend of the mushroom world. &#8220;Mushrooms grow on the ground,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and few of them are edible. Most of them cause death by choking.&#8221; The botanist Theophrastus was incompetent in his discussions of the fungi, and while Dioscorides and Galen were better, many of their observations were grossly inaccurate, and they are interesting on this subject chiefly for the further proof they offer that the Greeks were mycophobes. To this day the Greeks pay no attention to wild mushrooms, like the English eating only the psalhota campestris, which they call μανιτάρι, a word descended from the classical άμανῖται.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b18-fn4" id="cp5b18-r4">[4]</a></sup></p>

            <p>We believe that this mycophobia of the Greeks holds the key to the meaning, hitherto unperceived, of a famous anecdote about Nero that Suetonius recorded. Suetonius, writing a half century after the event, accused Nero of having been privy to the murder of Claudius, supporting his charge by an inference: &#8216;for Nero used afterwards to laud mushrooms, the vehicle in which the poison was administered to Claudius, as gods&#8217; food <i>[deorum cibum],</i> as the Greek proverb has it.&#8217; This witticism, alluding to the posthumous deification of Claudius, is stale now from age and repetition, but thanks to it we possess a Greek saying nowhere else recorded. Dio Cassius told the same story later, and later still we find it in the writings of Petrus Patricius, a contemporary of Belisarius,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b18-fn5" id="cp5b18-r5">[5]</a></sup> who adds a telling detail. When the mushrooms came on, a guest remarked that they were gods&#8217; food, θεῶν βρῶμα. This gave Nero his opening, and how the murderous implications of his retort must have chilled the sycophantic company! What did the Greeks mean by &#8216;gods&#8217; food&#8217;? Certainly not &#8216;food fit for the gods&#8217;, which would have called for different phrasing. Robert Graves suggests an answer. We know from Pliny that in the fashionable circles of Rome mushrooms were all the rage. But not so with the Greeks. It was surely a mycophobic Greek who interposed the Greek saying when he saw the mushrooms arrive, just as an Englishman on the Continent turns from a dish of morels because for him they are toadstools, or just as a Fleming in former times would have scorned <i>duivels-brood,</i> &#8216;devils&#8217; bread&#8217;. &#8216;Gods&#8217; food&#8217; and &#8216;devils&#8217; bread&#8217;, in their innermost meaning are synonyms, verbalizing the ancient tabu. We suggest that they go back to the time when the divine mushroom was holy and therefore unclean for all save the king-priest.</p>

            <p>In one striking respect the lands of extreme mycophilia and extreme mycophobia are alike: they are equally free of mushroom poisonings. Your Frisians never die from toadstools, for they never touch any wild fungi. And your Provençal villagers are equally safe, for they know which to eat. Henri Fabre in <i>The Life of the Fly</i> tells us that during his thirty years in the Proven9al village of Serignan, he had never heard of even the mildest indisposition from mushrooms, and this in face of the fact that his neighbors habitually ate many species described in the manuals of the day as poisonous or suspect! Fatalities from mushrooms take place where peoples are in transition, moving up in the scale of mycophagy.</p>

            <p>There is abundant evidence that slowly, very slowly, the peoples of Europe are learning to eat wild mushrooms. Their progress is reflected in their vocabulary. Some words that were born with a pejorative curse rise in status and acquire excellence in the course of centuries; such, we believe, are <i>mousseron</i> and <i>cepe</i> in French, and <i>boletus</i> in Latin. More often a new and appetizing word is borrowed from a mycophagic people to designate a mushroom that, seen in a new light, has come to be esteemed for food. Such is &#8216;mushroom&#8217; in English, and <i>champignon</i> throughout the other Germanic lands, and <i>boletus,</i> which in German has become <i>Pilz.</i> Specially interesting is the Swedish name for the cep: <i>Karl Johans-svamp,</i> named after the founder of the present royal family, King Charles XVI John, a Frenchman, who having risen from the ranks to become Napoleon&#8217;s General Bernadotte, was elected to Sweden&#8217;s throne in 1818. It was he who drew the attention of Swedes to the succulent properties of the boletus edulis. We discover without surprise that the Bernadottes were a Gascon family, hailing from that province of France which is renowned for ceps. A good Gascon, General Bernadotte was a missionary of mycophagy to the mycophobic Swedes.</p>

            <p>The mycophobic peoples seem to acquire their knowledge in little leaps, suggestive of the quantum theory, learning to like one species after another. The English generally know only the psalliota campestris, and the Norwegians the cantharellus cibarius; the Spaniards of Castile eat two kinds, the <i>mizcalo</i> (a lactarius) and the <i>seta de cardo</i> (pleurotus eryngii), by contrast with the vast command of the subject enjoyed by the Catalans. The poverty of the Spanish language when it comes to mushrooms occasionally works a hardship on Spanish writers: in the Spanish encyclopaedias the authors of the articles on <i>hongos</i> must resort to Catalan and Basque words to piece out the poor Castilian vocabulary. The Spanish public has never been offered a Spanish mushroom manual, and if a Spaniard should seek to explore the mushroom world, he must resort to a Basque work, <i>Setas u Hongos del Pais Vasco,</i> a treatise in two slim volumes written in Spanish by Telesforo de Aranzadi and published in 1897. Based entirely on observations in the Basque country, it is precious especially for the wealth of Basque vernacular names that it records. The public demand for this work must have been modest, for the original edition is still in print and copies are available generally in Spanish book shops.</p>

            <p>In Portugal the peasants know chiefly the lepiota procera, which they call the <i><span xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">nisco</span></i> or <i><span xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">centeiro</span></i>. The Basques, with a substantial vocabulary, are well advanced in mycophagy, but many of their words are borrowed, and mycophagy among them is perhaps not indigenous. Strangely, they possess no name for the lactarius sanguifluus, which is esteemed by both Catalans and Castilians. On the other hand, we can testify that in Viscaya the Basques manifest an addiction for the russula virescens. In the west of that western Basque province, this mushroom, which is the best of the russulas, is called by a specific name &#8212;&#8203; <i>guibelurdina,</i> but in Guernica it appears to so dominate the field of mycophagy that it becomes simply the &#8216;mushroom&#8217; &#8212;&#8203; <i>perretxiko.</i></p>

            <p>Various strands of evidence support our view that Western Europe is progressing in mycophagy. Take Italy, for example. Today immense quantities of mushrooms are eaten there, and the local names are numerous. But we observe that poisonings often occur &#8212;&#8203; a sure sign of imperfect knowledge. From Pliny and other ancient writers we know that certain mushrooms were fashionable among the fastidious elite in imperial Rome, but if we ask our question about the rest of the population, we must admit that we know little. Apicius gives us various mushroom recipes, and Pliny describes several kinds with sufficient detail for us to guess at their identity, in two or three cases with confidence. But Pliny himself looked down his nose at mushrooms, and there is one sentence in his <i>Natural History</i> that, almost by inadvertence, reveals his own mycophobic leanings. With some impatience he admits that others know more about mushrooms than he. &#8220;Who, in fact,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is able to distinguish among them, except those who dwell in the country, and those who are in the habit of gathering them?&#8221; That is, who knew the mushrooms except the untutored rustics, mute for us, and the minions of the epicures in the great city? As to the epicures, Pliny with disdain tells us that mushrooms were the only dish they would prepare with their own hands, thus relishing them twice over, once in anticipation and once in the eating. Here are the rich phrases of Pliny&#8217;s Elizabethan translator, Philemon Holland:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>&#8230; our fine-mouthed and daintie wantons who set such store by their tooth, take so great delight to dresse this onely dish with their owne hands, that they may feed therupon in conceit and cogitation all the while they bee handling and preparing the same, furnished in this their businesse with their fine knives and razors of amber, and other vessels of silver plate about them.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>On an earlier page we saw <i>that fungus</i> was an epithet in ancient Rome, the equivalent of &#8216;dunce&#8217; or &#8216;gump&#8217; in English &#8212;&#8203; an indication that the people who so used the word had little esteem for mushrooms.</p>

            <p>Jumping now to Renaissance times, we open the earliest printed cookbook, entitled <i>De Honesta Voluptate,</i> attributed to a Vatican dignitary named Platina and printed in Rome c. 1474. There we find a section on mushrooms, and it is a farrago of mycophobic nonsense, of a kind that would not be tolerated by discriminating Italians today. It must have expressed more or less the sentiments of the upper crust in the Rome of Platina&#8217;s day. This work was translated into many languages and it almost monopolized the cookbook market for a century and more. The French version, of which we have consulted an edition published in Lyons in 1505, has a peculiar linguistic interest: the translator uses various words for &#8216;mushroom&#8217; and among them is <i>fonge.</i> This may have been the translator&#8217;s bookish invention; at any rate/onge never took hold in France, the only part of Romanic Europe where <i>fungus</i> has had no verbal progeny in the vernacular.</p>

            <p>Two centuries before Platina another Italian, Aldobrandino da Siena, composed in French a medical treatise, <i>Le Livre pour la Sante du Corps,</i> at the behest of the Countess of Provence, Beatrice ofSavoy.lt appears to have been finished in the year 1256 and it survives in many manuscripts copied in the course of the ensuing centuries. Aldobrandino relied heavily on the writings in Arabic of a 10th century physician living in Egypt, Isaac Judaeus. Here too we find a chapter on mushrooms. Aldobrandino writes in the purest mycophobic vein, the best that he can say of mushrooms being this, that some there are which are not so bad. Though written in French, the Aldobrandino work cannot of course be taken as an expression of a French attitude. It is of special interest to us for the illuminated initial with which the chapter on mushrooms begins.</p>

            <p>Coming to France itself, we begin by observing that the French Canadians know nothing of wild mushrooms and never eat them. Their ancestors came largely from Poitou, with a sprinkling of Basques, Bretons, Channel Islanders, and Normans. A conservative people, the <i>habitants</i> would not have given up mycophagy in the New World, where the forests are rich in kinds that are common in France. It seems probable that in their ancestral lands mushrooms were not eaten three centuries ago, and certainly this is still true of the Bretons. Mycophagy in France is spreading north from the Midi and Gascony. The reports of poisonings, the modern diffusion of new names like <i>cepe</i>, the constant revision of municipal regulations governing the sale of mushrooms &#8212;&#8203; these all bear witness to growing pains as mycophagy gains ground. Though wild mushrooms are commonly offered in the marketplaces of France in the appropriate seasons, it is not unusual to meet French folk who know nothing whatever about them, not even the names of some of the common kinds. Van Sterbeeck in his <i>Theatrum Fungorum</i> on page 117 quotes Clusius, native of the French city of Arras and father of modern mycology, as saying that he had never eaten a mushroom! An underlying mycophobia would explain the readiness of the French to associate wild mushrooms with toxic properties. The king of the elephants in <i>Babar</i> dies, in defiance of nature, from eating a fly amanita; and the death of this beloved albeit imaginary beast implants the microbe of mycophobia in the defenceless minds of countless children. One of the best French movies, Sacha Guitry&#8217;s <i>Le Tricheur,</i> hangs its story on the death of a whole family from mushrooms. Jules Romains in his play, <i>Knock ou le Triomphe de la Mededne,</i> introduces a lady of the French landed aristocracy who sells a property called la Michouille where mushrooms never grow, the very name being derived from <i>mycodium,</i> &#8216;hate of mushrooms&#8217;, a strange conceit that we think only a mycophobic writer would invoke. But in Marcel Moussy&#8217;s <i>Arcole ou la Terre Promise</i> there is an idyllic setting in which a young couple go mushroom gathering.</p>

            <p>Certain <i>gastronomes</i> among our French friends resent our imputation of mycophobia to the French. But take Montaigne. This giant of the Renaissance, who poured the rich contents of his mind and feelings into his essays, ignores the fungal world. Not even truffles are so much as mentioned by this son of Perigord. True, Montaigne had apparently little interest in food and drink of any kind. But then let us look at his elder contemporary, whom he admired, François Rabelais. When Epistemon visits the abode of the damned, he discovers there all the personages of antiquity, and finds that for all eternity they are condemned to menial and insignificant occupations: Alexander the Great darns breeches while Dido peddles mushrooms! Elsewhere Rabelais presents to his readers an obnoxious character called Lent-observer whose pinched soul knows only denial. He had a <i>potiron,</i> mushroom, for a chin, and his excrement consisted of morels and toadstools. There is never a kind word for mushrooms in Rabelais, this native of Chinon in the very heart of France.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b18-fn6" id="cp5b18-r6">[6]</a></sup></p>

            <p>It is never easy to trace down the centuries the gastronomic role of a kind of mushroom. Perhaps the distinctive truffle offers us the best opportunity for such a chronicle, yet here too we encounter contradictions. According to M. G. Malençon in <i>Les Truffes Europeennes,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b18-fn7" id="cp5b18-r7">[7]</a></sup></i> for a thousand years after the fall of the Roman Empire no one in Italy or France paid attention to truffles. In the 14<sup>th</sup> century they reappeared. During the Renaissance the truffle of Perigord &#8212;&#8203; tuber melanosporum &#8212;&#8203; established its ascendancy, and with some ups and downs thereafter maintained a secure place high in the firmament of gastronomic values in the most exalted circles of France. We have already seen that the English diarist Evelyn was making the acquaintance of truffles in Vienne in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, and after the Restoration in England they begin to appear in cookbooks across the Channel. Yet we have also seen that Brillat-Savarin in the early 18<sup>th</sup> century considered the truffle a modern innovation in Paris. These seeming contradictions can be reconciled when we remind ourselves that we are dealing with accidental references by writers belonging to the articulate elite of France and England. In our section on the truffle we produced linguistic evidence showing that the truffle was always an article of commerce in the humble marketplaces of the Mediterranean peoples, bought and sold and consumed by countless generations of unlettered folk.</p>

            <p>In the beginning the Germanic world was steeped in darkest mycophobia. Certainly nowhere in European literature is there a more perfect expression of loathing for mushrooms &#8212;&#8203; all the more eloquent because taken for granted &#8212;&#8203; than in the writings of Saxo Grammaticus, the Danish historian who flourished about A.D. 1200. He was telling of a military campaign waged in Sweden by Hadding the Dane in the 10<sup>th</sup> century, and how the Danes ran out of provisions, and were driven to the last extremities of hunger. Here in Book I: viii: 7 of his <i>Saxonis Gesta Danorum</i> we discover the low opinion in which the Danes of olden times held wild mushrooms:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>&#8230; After the spring thaw, Hadding returned to Sweden and there spent five years in warfare. By reason of this lengthy campaign, his soldiers, having consumed all their provisions, were reduced virtually to starvation, and resorted to forest mushrooms to satisfy their hunger. Finally under pressure of extreme necessity they ate their horses, and in the end they satisfied themselves with the carcasses of dogs. Even worse, they did not scruple to eat human limbs.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Now that the passing centuries have dimmed for us the personal sufferings of Hadding&#8217;s host, we may permit ourselves to be amused by the graduated stages<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b18-fn8" id="cp5b18-r8">[8]</a></sup> of their desperation as reflected in their diet, and our thoughts turn to what soldiers of other origins would have done in a like pass. Had they been Celts, they would surely have eaten horses, dogs, and each other before turning to the foul fungi of the forest. If they had been Slavs of the North, they would have been feasting on those noble mushrooms from the outset of their long campaign, and, fortified by the delectable fare, would have engaged the enemy like lions, and most certainly turned the tide of war. Until General Bernadotte, when King of Sweden, spoke well of ceps, neither Lapps nor Swedes ate mushrooms. We know this because Linnaeus tells us so. In the section on the fungi in his <i>Flora Lapponica,</i> he observes that in Sweden only foreigners consider mushrooms fit for eating, nor does he except himself from the general rule. What a pity that the great Linnaeus was a mycophobe!</p>

            <p>As for the Lapps, Linnaeus in the same work tells us where their fungal interest lay, and the passage is unique in ethno-mycological records. Linnaeus devotes a lengthy section of his work to the fungi of Lappland, and as he comes to the end and is describing Boletus 522, which he calls &#8216;suavaeolens&#8217;, he reports that the young Lappish swains when stepping out to keep company with the Lappish girls would carry this fungus in a little bag over the male member, that its scent might please the nymphs. The &#8216;boletus&#8217; used in this way, according to Professor Heim, was undoubtedly the trametes suavaeolens Fr. ex Linn., conspicuous for its strong odor of anise. Linnaeus was frank in his description:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Adolescentes hunc inventum sollicite servant in <i>marsupio ante pubem pendulo,</i> ut gratiorem odorem spirantes nymphis suis placeant. [Italics ours.]</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>When Knut Hagberg brought out his life of Linnaeus in 1939 he deprived this delightful passage of its sap by translating <i>ante pubem pendulo</i> as &#8216;on the stomach&#8217; <i>(pa magen),</i> and his English translator further diluted Linnaeus by hanging the fungus &#8216;from the waist&#8217;! Such is the prudery that censors the classics! The Lappish custom moved the mycophobic Linnaeus to indulge in a discursive rhapsody of the kind that lesser scientists frown upon:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>O ridicula Venus, tibi, quse in exteris regionibus uteris caffea &amp; cocholata, conditis &amp; saccharatis, virus &amp; bellariis, gemmis &amp; margaritis, auro et argento, serico et cosmetico, saltationibus &amp; conventiculis, musica &amp; comoediis, tibi sufficit his solus exsuccus fungus.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>We can show that long after Saxo Grammaticus, and even after the Reformation, mycophobia was still rampant in Germany. A few years ago there was discovered in the Copenhagen Royal Library a document of high cultural interest. It was penned early in the lyth century by a Hanseatic merchant of Lubeck who had sojourned long enough in Pskov to learn the Russian dialect of that city. The manuscript is a textbook of colloquial Russian, giving as exercises in Russian phraseology authentic dialogues recorded by the author. Among them are a few between Russians and Germans in which each side praises the life of his own home town. In the course of one such colloquy we come upon a German mycophobic boast of priceless value for our argument, proving as it does the contrast between Russian and German attitudes toward the fungal world. Here are the texts in the Russian dialect of Pskov and the German dialect of Lubeck, along with an English translation by Mrs. Elizabeth van Schooneveld, who is now editing the manuscript for publication:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Nashi nemetzkie ljudi zhivut kak [g]ospodari, svezhe mjaso da svezhi ryby jedjaft] da vina da pivo p&#8217;ju[t], da vashi ljudi kak psy borzye, ryzh[i]ki griben jedja[t] da p&#8217;ju[t] vodu i kvas.</p>

                <p>Unse dutsche lude leuen alse heren ehten fersch flesch und fersche fische, und drincken wyn und beer, und juwe volk alse beste und wynthunde ehten poggenstole und drinken wahter und qwasz.</p>

                <p>Our German people live like lords, eat fresh meat and fresh fish and drink wines and beer, and your people like beasts and coursing hounds, eat toadstools and drink water and kvas.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The aspersion thrown into the teeth of the Russians by the merchant of Lubeck is corroborated by linguistic evidence of singular probative value. The Jews of Germany some centuries ago migrated east into the Slavic lands, taking with them their language based on medieval German dialects, which we know as Yiddish. The mushroom vocabulary in Yiddish is largely Slavic, borrowed after the migration. The generic term for &#8216;mushroom&#8217;, however, is <i>shveml,</i> a diminutive form from the German <i>Schwamm;</i> the favorable <i>Pilz</i> has no continuation in Yiddish. It is clear that when the Jews migrated to Poland, they took no tradition of mycophagy with them. Apparently the Germans began eating mushrooms late in the Middle Ages, and needing a word to dignify the new dish, they turned to the Latin <i>boletus,</i> which in Valerius Cordus (1551) had become <i>Boltz</i> and in Clusius (1601) was <i>Btiltz</i> and is today <i>Pilz.</i> Thus <i>Pilz</i> entered Germany&#8217;s fungal vocabulary at the top, to suit the dinner-table, while at the lower end of the scale the pejorative <i>Krotenschwamm,</i> also recorded by Clusius as current in his day, fell into disuse and finally disappeared from High German. Here we see how a change in names reflected, and at the same time encouraged, a change in attitude toward the eating of wild fungi. It is noteworthy that the growth of mycophagy in Germany appears to have been a response to Mediterranean influences descending culturally from above, rather than an eruption of the Slavic substratum that was still strong in Central Europe.</p>

            <p>Today in Sweden and Denmark and Southern Germany and German Switzerland, bands of young people go out in season from the cities to gather mushrooms. The market places of Southern Germany and Switzerland are well stocked with many kinds of wild mushrooms. Is not this interest a modern thing, perhaps as modern as the sport of mountain-climbing? Do the rustics know their mushrooms as these city youths do &#8212;&#8203; except as the market demand of the cities has led the country folk to respond by gathering the appropriate kinds? Is there not here a cultural penetration that began with the sophisticated city circles and spread thence to the countryside? Dr. J. Schlittler, Pilzkontrolleur of Zurich, confirms our suspicion. He tells us that in the back valleys of the Alps the peasants still reject all mushrooms, still view them through medieval eyes, clinging to the old mycophobic beliefs. We also learn that the Romansch-speaking country folk of the Surselva and the Engadine know nothing of edible wild mushrooms and care nothing, though in these lovely valleys they grow in abundance. There is evidence that while Otto Bismarck was serving as Ambassador in Russia around 1860 he discovered and mastered the art of mushroom knowing, and acquired a taste for mushroom hunting and marinated mushrooms that he took back with him to Germany.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp5b18-fn9" id="cp5b18-r9">[9]</a></sup></p>

            <p>Though we think mycophagy among the Swiss is a modern growth, its hold is already secure. A story, told to us in Geneva as true, bears witness to this. An aged countryman in the Suisse Romande found himself borne down by the infirmities of age and the loss of those dearest to him. There came a time when he invited a young friend to pass a long and arduous day with him in the mountains. A glorious day it was, in the course of which the old man took pains to reveal to his companion with painstaking precision all of the spots known to him where mushrooms grew, various kinds of mushrooms but especially morels, knowledge slowly gathered on solitary rambles made for that purpose over the course of a long life. Marveling to himself at this untoward behavior, the young man showed proper appreciation and made careful note of all the locations. That night the unhappy octogenarian took his own life. His penultimate act had been to pass on to the youth of his choice his precious possession, a worldly legacy that no testamentary provision could have conveyed.</p>

            <p>Indifference that overlies a sleeping hostility is the attitude toward wild mushrooms of the typical mycophobe in a country like England. He and his neighbors think alike about these creatures; rather, they react alike, for they do not think, ignoring as they do their own infirmity. The mycophobe does not initiate a discussion about wild mushrooms. If the subject comes up in his presence, instantly he is on his guard. He is almost sure to recall some fatal episode involving poisonous mushrooms that, he says, came within his personal experience. He admits grudgingly that some good wild mushrooms exist, but his strongly held view is that all are dangerous save a few, and these no amateur can be relied upon to identify. Yes, identification is difficult and never sure. As like as not, the mycophobe will tell you that every good kind has its deadly counterpart, as though Divine Providence had deliberately laid booby traps to catch the fool who insists upon hunting mushrooms. He is apt to go on and suggest that kinds familiar to you in your country may well be deadly hereabouts. He volunteers his advice for your own good, as one who wishes to be clearly on record that your death will be on your own head. He is dogmatic, his voice has a cutting edge. If you are bold and put questions to him, you discover at once that he knows nothing about wild mushrooms, and that he is happy and even determined to remain in invincible ignorance, feeling that that way safety lies. Furthermore, this mycophobia of the North Sea basin is a dominant trait. The English-speaking mycophobe when he goes to live in a mycophagous country seldom learns to know the mushrooms and avoids eating them. By contrast, the mycophagous Slavs who live in England or the United States sometimes succumb, albeit slowly, to the steady pressure of the hostile environment, weakly accepting the facile advice of well-meaning but ignorant neighbors who assure them that the species they knew and loved in the lands of their childhood become deadly, for some mysterious reason, inside the political frontiers of an English-speaking world. How truly John Parkinson spoke for his countrymen when in 1640, in his <i>Theatrum Botanicutn,</i> he begins his chapter on the &#8216;Dangerous Mushrooms&#8217; with the observation that he can be brief about them, for it would be to little purpose (as he says) to dwell on them, inasmuch as the English need no caution "to beware of the bad, seeing our Nation is not so enclined to the good".</p>

            <p>The Englishman&#8217;s rejection of the mushroom tribe is a Pavlov reflex. We have known Englishmen who retch at the thought of eating a wild mushroom, just as some orthodox Jews do at the thought of pork. Wilmarth Lewis, presiding over the world of Horace Walpole, has drawn to our attention a delightful passage in a letter that Walpole wrote on October 17, 1758, to Lady Hervey. On the flimsiest provocation, the Duke of Newcastle had lately given an exhibition of violent mycophobia that must be considered classic. For the sake of a quotation from Jeremiah, Walpole changes Newcastle&#8217;s famous chef Chloe into a woman. Here is the episode in Walpole&#8217;s words:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>This will be a melancholy letter, for I have nothing to tell your Ladyship but tragical stories. Poor Dr Shawe being sent for in great haste to Claremont (it seems the Duchess had caught a violent cold by a hair of her own whisker getting up her nose and making her sneeze) — the poor Doctor, I say, having eaten a few mushrooms before he set out, was taken so ill, that he was forced to stop at Kingston; and being carried to the first apothecary&#8217;s prescribed a medicine for himself which immediately cured him. This catastrophe so alarmed the Duke of Newcastle that he immediately ordered all the mushroom beds to be destroyed, and even the toadstools in the park did not escape scalping in this general massacre. What I tell you is literally true. Mr. Stanley, who dined there last Sunday, and is not partial against that court, heard the edict repeated, and confirmed it to me last night. And a voice of lamentation was heard at Ramah in Claremont, <i>Chloe</i> weeping for <i>her</i> mushrooms, and they are not!</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>There is a striking contrast between mycophobic and mycophilic peoples when it comes to fungal vocabularies. In Muscovy and Provence and Catalonia the countryfolk possess a huge vocabulary, familiar to all, and ancient. If in those countries there be any who do not know their mushrooms, these benighted individuals are pitiful city-bred waifs, cut off from the land that gave them birth and from their proper cultural heritage. In mycophobic countries, the farmers know almost nothing about wild mushrooms and speak of them with two or three undiscriminating words. But in the cities there will be found little circles of amateurs who make a hobby or cult of their mushroomic knowledge, and who learn from manuals a large vocabulary that circulates only on their lips. The run of rustic English folk know &#8216;toadstool&#8217;, &#8216;mushroom&#8217;, &#8216;puffball&#8217;, and possibly a few localisms. If the countryman knows &#8216;fungus&#8217;, it is as a learned word. Only in cities and in esoteric circles, does one hear of truffles and morels and ceps, not to speak of death-cups, destroying angels, shaggy-manes, and all the other book-words that the manuals carry. The reader of these manuals is at a loss about these so-called vulgar names. Some are clearly of venerable lineage. For example, no mycologist would have invented the &#8216;horse mushroom&#8217; for the psalliota arvensis; the term belongs with &#8216;horse-radish&#8217;, &#8216;horse chestnut&#8217;, and &#8216;horse mussel&#8217;, wherein the first element means &#8216;large&#8217; or &#8216;coarse&#8217;. We think also that &#8216;shaggy mane&#8217; for the coprinus comatus may be a word of respectable lineage: as long ago as 1802 A. F. M. Willich in <i>The Domestic Encyclopedia</i> was writing about the &#8216;shaggy spunk&#8217;, a mushroom known to science in his day as the boletus hirsutus. On the other hand, where a common name is wanting, the mycologists seem to have invented fanciful neologisms to meet the need, without troubling to distinguish genuine localisms from the fruit of their own fancies. Today there are excellent mushroom manuals in France and England, but until our generation the manuals in those countries were often saturated with mycophobic caution. I possess the Russian manual, published in 1903, that originally belonged to Tatiana, daughter of Nicholas II, in which in childish handwriting she wrote her name. It is a delightful book, full of friendliness for wild mushrooms, all of which seem to be considered good except two or three kinds that are cursorily dismissed. By contrast, some of the older manuals of France and England deliberately set out to frighten the reader. They are filled with labored warnings, giving the impression that all mushrooms are bad except a few kinds that even the careful reader can hardly hope to learn, even if he uses utmost care. By a curious twist of fate, this excess of caution in the manuals once accidentally contributed to the undoing of a murderer, as we have seen in our account of l&#8217;affaire Girard.</p>

            <p>Wild fungi are an emotional trip-hammer for mycophile and mycophobe alike, and in the poets with their heightened sensibilities the contrast in the response to fungi is sharpest. Professor Roman Jakobson was spending the summer of 1919 in Pushkino, near Moscow, with the poet Vladimir Majakovskij, who would go out almost daily into the forest to look for mushrooms. He would usually return with a large basket full of them. He knew them all and where to look for every kind. He told his companion that mushroom gathering offered the ideal accompaniment for the composition of poetry, and in the course of that summer he composed the best parts of his epic, <i>150 Million,</i> while engaged in this pastime. During the previous season, in 1918, he had conceived his play <i>Mystery Bouffe</i> in the woods among the mushrooms.</p>

            <p>Now contrast Majakovskij&#8217;s feelings with those of D. H. Lawrence. Not long after the scene in Pushkino, the Englishman wrote his poem entitled <i>How Beastly the Bourgeois Is,</i> and to match the repugnance that he felt for his subject, he resorts to mushrooms for his analogy:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>How beastly the bourgeois is<br/>
                    especially the male of the species -</p>

                <p>Nicely groomed, like a mushroom<br/>
                    standing there so sleek and erect and eyeable -<br/>
                    and like a fungus, living on the remains of bygone life,<br/>
                    sucking his life out of the dead leaves of greater life than his own.</p>

                <p>And even so, he&#8217;s stale, he&#8217;s been there too long, Touch<br/>
                    him, and you&#8217;ll find he&#8217;s all gone inside just like an old<br/>
                    mushroom, all wormy inside, and hollow under a smooth<br/>
                    skin and an upright appearance.</p>

                <p>Full of seething, wormy, hollow feelings<br/>
                    rather nasty -<br/>
                    How beastly the bourgeois is!</p>

                <p>Standing in their thousands, these appearances, in damp England<br/>
                    what a pity they can&#8217;t all be kicked over<br/>
                    like sickening toadstools, and left to melt back, swiftly<br/>
                    into the soil of England.</p>
                
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Here then in these two literary artists we discover the perfect mycophile and the perfect mycophobe. For the Russian a world carpeted with mushrooms is Elysium. For the Englishman that same world conjures up foul exhalations rising wraith-like from rotting swamps, and the mephitic horror turns his stomach.</p>
