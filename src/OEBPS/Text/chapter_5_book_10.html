  <p class="calibre1">Scholars have not found the derivation of 'mushroom', and therefore the field</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lies open for amateur inquirers. The word has circulated in English for some five</p>

  <p class="calibre1">centuries at least, in many forms, and the variant 'musheron' is still often heard</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the United States. It is clear that the English borrowed the word from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French language spoken at court in the Middle Ages, the French word surviving</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in modern French as <i class="calibre4">mousseron.</i> Either the Normans or French showed the English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for the first time that certain wild fungi could be eaten, and the need for a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name for the edible fungi was met by 'mushroom'. In the course of time it has</p>

  <p class="calibre1">come to designate edible fungi in general and specifically the psalliota campestris.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">This specific use developed later, after the art of cultivating the field mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">gave to it unique importance - such importance, indeed, that its French name,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">champignon,</i> superseded <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> as the generic word for mushrooms in France.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It used to be thought that <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> sprang from <i class="calibre4">mousse,</i> meaning 'moss', but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for a long time not a single French philologist has espoused what is certainly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a popular etymology, which was first propounded in print in 1651 by N. de</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bonnefons, the gardener. It is clear that the present spelling of <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> has</p>

  <p class="calibre1">come about to satisfy the popular association of ideas. Among the oldest forms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the word in French are two - <i class="calibre4">moisseron</i> and <i class="calibre4">meisseron -</i> that could not be</p>

  <p class="calibre1">linked to moss.1 Both Oscar Bloch and Albert Dauzat arrive at the conclusion</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the word is of pre-Latin origin - a convenient catchbasin, in the world</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Romance languages, for all problem children of etymology.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our word is not confined to English and French. Jean-Baptiste Barla, a first-class</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycologist and faithful observer, reported that in the Provence, around Nice,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the natives say <i class="calibre4">moussairoun</i> and <i class="calibre4">mousselet.2</i> The Catalans speak of the <i class="calibre4">moixerno.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The word also appears in a single dialect of Basque, in Lower Navarre, where it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">takes the form of <i class="calibre4">motxolon.</i> Wherever the word is used on the Continent, in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French, Provencal, Catalan, and Basque, it designates the species of mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room known as the tricholoma gambosum or georgii. The dialectical variants</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of 'mushroom' in English have been numerous, and among them several stem</p>

  <p class="calibre1">back to the obsolete French forms: mesheroom, mesheroon, and mishroom.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. French philologists cite a Latin passage in the 6th century medical writer Anthimus wherein occurs <i class="calibre4">mussi-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">rionetn,</i> standing in the accusative case. This would be the oldest citation of our word. But Professor Joshua</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Whatmough of Harvard has shown that it is an interpolation. Of the seven ms. sources for Anthimus, five that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">go back in part independently to the archetype do not include the passage in which this word occurs. Of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other two, one is an nth century ms. and the other refers to an event that took place in A.D. 849. The evid</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ence seems to point to the 9th century for the interpolation.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. <i class="calibre4">Les Champignons des Alpes,</i> Nice, 1888.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is a Welsh form, <i class="calibre4">maesrin</i> (pronounced 'mice-rin'), which may have been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">only a bookish word, but which preserves for us the early sound as known to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Welsh when they borrowed it.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some years ago Robert Graves suggested to us that we consider the Greek</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word for mushroom as the source of the French and English terms. We think</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he was right. Our readers will recall that in German <i class="calibre4">Schivamm</i> means both</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungus and sponge, but that the Greeks limited the corresponding word in their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">language, σπόγγος, to 'sponge'. For mushroom they used μύκης, whence the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">science of 'mycology'. The Greek word is inextricably associated with μύζα,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which in Latin becomes <i class="calibre4">mucus,</i> or when referring to nasal mucus, <i class="calibre4">tnuccus.</i> All</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these words are repulsive for us. For the Greeks mushrooms were mucoid things,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">slimy growths, a far remove from the Russians' 'fat of the earth'. There is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">abundant evidence that the Greeks were and remain mycophobes. The evolu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion of Greek μύκης into the Provencal, Catalan, and obsolete French words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is not hard to reconstruct, so far as the first syllable goes.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But this does not solve our problem, for we must still explain the ending <i class="calibre4">-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">(e}ron</i> of the French word. Proceeding on the surmise that it is a suffix, we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sought to determine its value by assembling a list of as many French words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ending with it as we could find. (It is surprising that in a language so thoroughly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dissected as French no one had done this before.) Our inquiry was fruitful. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nouns ending in <i class="calibre4">-(e)ron</i> fall into three groups, according to the purpose</p>

  <p class="calibre1">served by the suffix. First are the words that designate an occupation:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. <i class="calibre4">bucheron,</i> woodcutter,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. <i class="calibre4">forgeron,</i> blacksmith, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3. <i class="calibre4">vigneron,</i> vine-grower.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is a second group in which the ending is a diminutive, a variant of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">diminutive <i class="calibre4">-on,</i> as in <i class="calibre4">ourson,</i> little bear, and <i class="calibre4">raton,</i> 'little rat'. The variant in <i class="calibre4">-ron</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">is used where there is need to preserve the value of the final silent <i class="calibre4">e</i> of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">original noun:2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. <i class="calibre4">aileron,</i> small wing,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. <i class="calibre4">boteron,</i> small toad,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3. <i class="calibre4">chaperon,</i> small headgear,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">4. <i class="calibre4">coteron, cotteron,</i> diminutive of <i class="calibre4">cotte,</i> English 'coat',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">5. <i class="calibre4">courgeron,</i> kind of <i class="calibre4">courge</i> or gourd,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">6. <i class="calibre4">laideron,</i> an ill-favored woman,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. It is necessary to assume that the Greek word passed through unrecorded popular Latin forms in <i class="calibre4">mux-</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">mix-,</i> sound mutations that can be paralleled in other words.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. <i class="calibre4">Cuceron, cusseron,</i> the insect, an enemy of vegetable gardeners, seems to have developed from <i class="calibre4">cusson, cosson,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">by a false popular analogy with <i class="calibre4">puceron.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">1 4 6</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUCUS, MUSHROOMS, AND LOVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">7. <i class="calibre4">lisseron, liceron,</i> diminutive of <i class="calibre4">lisse, lice,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">8. <i class="calibre4">mancheron,</i> short sleeve,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">9. <i class="calibre4">moucheron,</i> gnat,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">10. <i class="calibre4">napperon,</i> napkin,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">11. <i class="calibre4">paleron,</i> shoulder-blade,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">12. <i class="calibre4">pelleron,</i> baker's scoop,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">13. <i class="calibre4">piqueron,</i> diminutive <i class="calibre4">of pique,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">14. <i class="calibre4">puceron,</i> plant-louse, aphis, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">15. <i class="calibre4">vesceron,</i> a small species of vetch, diminutive of <i class="calibre4">vesce.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The third group, which is the one relevant to our argument, consists of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">following words, of which no less than four refer to mushrooms:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. <i class="calibre4">auburon,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">8. <i class="calibre4">fumeron,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">2. mousseron,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">9. <i class="calibre4">grateron</i> and <i class="calibre4">glouteron,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">3. <i class="calibre4">potiron,</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">10. <i class="calibre4">laiteron, laceron,</i> and <i class="calibre4">lacheron,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">4. <i class="calibre4">sauceron,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">n. <i class="calibre4">liseron,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">5. <i class="calibre4">biberon,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">12. <i class="calibre4">longeron,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">6. bourgeron,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">13. <i class="calibre4">quarteron,</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">7. <i class="calibre4">culeron,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">14. <i class="calibre4">secheron.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In every instance the suffix adds particularity to a less determinate idea conveyed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">by the stem. The general condenses into the particular. A 'mass' noun becomes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a 'countable' one.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Let us examine these fourteen words one by one. <i class="calibre4">A biberon</i> is a feeding-cup</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or baby's bottle, from the Latin verb <i class="calibre4">bibere.</i> A <i class="calibre4">bourgeron</i> is a jacket made from a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">material formerly called <i class="calibre4">borge.</i> A <i class="calibre4">longeron</i> is a girder that runs lengthwise. A</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">fumeron</i> is the half-burnt charcoal that gives off smoke. <i class="calibre4">A quarteron is</i> a quadroon.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Secheron</i> is the word used in the mountainous east of France to designate a meadow</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that is chronically parched. The <i class="calibre4">culeron</i> is the 'crupper loop' that passes around</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the horse's tail. The other words are all names of species of plants. <i class="calibre4">Grateron (=</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">glouteron)</i> is a kind of briar. <i class="calibre4">Laiteron</i> (= <i class="calibre4">laceron, lacheron}</i> is milk-weed. <i class="calibre4">Liceron,</i> from</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Us,</i> is the bindweed or morning-glory. <i class="calibre4">Potiron</i> is a species of gourd and a fungus.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Sauceron</i> is a regional word reported in the Saone-et-Loire for 'mushroom',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">presumably from the verb <i class="calibre4">saucer,</i> to sop or soak or dunk, referring to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wetness of many wild mushrooms. <i class="calibre4">Auburon</i> is the most interesting of all. It</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is current in the East, where the French and German worlds meet. It designates</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the lactarius piperatus, and it comes down from the Latin <i class="calibre4">albus,</i> white. Some-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times it is written <i class="calibre4">oberon.</i> This is a large, fleshy, white mushroom. In a good</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom season, when the forest floor is carpeted with an immense number</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of mushrooms of many kinds, the big, sturdy <i class="calibre4">oberon</i> dominates its world, king</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of its realm. From afar it can be sighted, and as the sun sets and the shadows</p>

  <p class="calibre1">147</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_137"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_64">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">deepen, its brilliant whiteness seems to catch and hold the light a little longer.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It is no wonder that Oberon is king of the fairies. Yet so far as we can discover,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">no one has hitherto recognized the fungal ties of this famous character in French</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and German folklore, whom Shakespere summoned to his stage.1 In Russia the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">auburon</b></i> or lactarius piperatus is called the <i class="calibre4">gmzd',</i> and, as we have seen on an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">earlier page, <i class="calibre4">the gmzd'</i> plays a role in Russia's fungal folklore that recalls Oberon's.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our common nouns ending in <i class="calibre4">-(e)ron</i> are mostly rare and archaic words.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Since our etymology for <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> is persuasive only to the extent that we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">succeed in explaining its suffix, we welcome the abundant additional testimony</p>

  <p class="calibre1">supplied to us by a different category of words - family names. With these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">proper nouns lies the primary role of our suffix, and it is precisely here that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">particularity is of the essence: the general term is reduced in its application to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">distinctive family unit. Attributes of physique or personality, occupation, geo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">graphical origin, social status - the common nouns and place names become</p>

  <p class="calibre1">individualized as family names by the addition of <i class="calibre4">-(e}ron.</i> Furthermore, in this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">list we sense the common denominator that links together the three divisions</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of our common nouns, and find that they all belong really to a single class,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not three. Our suffix, in essence, contributes particularity to the primary word.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The reader who desires to arrive at the meaning of these proper nouns will</p>

  <p class="calibre1">consult Albert Dauzat's <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">Dictionnaire</b> Etymologique des Noms de Famille et Prenoms</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">If, then, we are right in our argument, the mushroom or <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> was once,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">metaphorically, a glob of mucus.2 Its original meaning long forgotten, the word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. Oberon in English is a literary character, without indigenous roots, borrowed from the French, where he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">appears in Old French in <i class="calibre4">Huon de Bordeaux.</i> He is 'Alberich' in the medieval German poem <i class="calibre4">Ortnit,</i> a name that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggests the German <i class="calibre4">Alp,</i> 'elf. But Jacob Grimm in his <i class="calibre4">Teutonic Mythology,</i> London, 1883, vol. n, p. 453, links</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'Alberich' with whiteness, from the Latin <i class="calibre4">albus,</i> a view that, as we now discover, is reinforced by the vernacular</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name given to the dazzling-white lactarius piperatus along the eastern marches of the French-speaking world.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. And also a glob of froth, if our suspicion is right that <i class="calibre4">mousse,</i> 'froth', has the same origin. But this word <i class="calibre4">mousse</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">and its homonym meaning 'moss' are so tangled together in their histories that we merely mention the pos</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sibility without arguing the case.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The obsolete <i class="calibre4">meckeron,</i> 'wick', 'little wick', was derived through Latin from Gr. |iu£a, and is cousin therefore</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to <i class="calibre4">meisseron, tnoisseron, mousseron.</i> Surely the obsolete adjective <i class="calibre4">mescheros,</i> 'dirtied', 'blackened', has the same</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUCUS, MUSHROOMS, AND LOVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has shifted in status (as occasionally words do), and from its mucoid origins has</p>

  <p class="calibre1">become appetizing. We believe that the Basque language offers us circumstantial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evidence in support of our theory. As we have seen, in the Basque dialect of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Lower Navarre our word appears as <i class="calibre4">motxolon,</i> and it carries the same meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> in French. In the Souletin dialect the same species is the <i class="calibre4">buxeti;</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">we trace this also to <i class="calibre4">mousseron,</i> for the Romance letter 'm' can become 'b' in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Basque; e.g., the Spanish word for 'mill', <i class="calibre4">molino,</i> appearing as <i class="calibre4">borin</i> or <i class="calibre4">bom</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">in certain Basque dialects; also the French word for 'cabinet-maker' or joiner',</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">memiisier,</i> becoming in Soule <i class="calibre4">beniise.</i> In many other sections of the Basque</p>

  <p class="calibre1">country, <i class="calibre4">ziza</i> takes the place of <i class="calibre4">motxolon,</i> designating the tricholoma gambo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sum and also tending to associate itself with other edible species. Thus it is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">precise translation of <i class="calibre4">mousseron.</i> The derivation of <i class="calibre4">ziza</i> has never been deter-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mined. But we discover that in the Souletin dialect of Basque, <i class="calibre4">zintz</i> means 'nasal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mucus', and is probably a word of imitative origin. Professor Rene Lafon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">informs us that phonetically <i class="calibre4">ziza</i> could be related to <i class="calibre4">zintz.</i> We suggest that it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is derived from <i class="calibre4">zintz</i> or an earlier form of that word, and that it was thus a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">translation of <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> made at a time when the original meaning of the French</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word was still present in men's minds. If we are right, <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> appears in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Basque as <i class="calibre4">motxolon,</i> a borrowed word, in Lower Navarre; as <i class="calibre4">buxeti,</i> also a bor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rowing, in the Soule; and as <i class="calibre4">ziza,</i> a translation, elsewhere. Thus, if this argument</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stands up under scrutiny, we provide a satisfying etymology for the Basque</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">ziza</i> and simultaneously buttress our fungal word pattern derived from μύκης.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For 'mushroom' and <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> we have dared to propose an etymology and a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">latent meaning where scholars have been at a loss. There is another French fungal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word, <i class="calibre4">le cepe de Bordeaux,</i> where we shall challenge the conventional etymology.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The standard sources have accepted the popular notion that <i class="calibre4">le cepe</i> is the same</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word as <i class="calibre4">le ceps de vigne,</i> 'vine-stock', both descended from the Latin <i class="calibre4">cippus,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">having admitted a popular etymology by inattention. The boletus edulis does</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not suggest a stake, nor has such a metaphor any parallel in the fungal vocabulary</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Europe.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We know much about the role of the boletus edulis in the social history of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Western Europe. The Romans called it the <i class="calibre4">snillus,</i> 'swine-mushroom', a word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that apparently survived as <i class="calibre4">silli</i> in the dialect of Naples down to the end of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">derivation and refers to the wick's snuff. Philologists have been baffled by the origin <i class="calibre4">oftndchurer,</i> 'to blacken with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">soot', and <i class="calibre4">mdchuron,</i> 'smudge' or 'smut' (on the face), 'smudged impression' (in printing). Should they not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">consider <i class="calibre4">mecheron</i> and the wick's snuff as the key to the etymon? The vowel change parallelcs <i class="calibre4">tache,</i> 'stain',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the 18th century.1 In standard Italian it is <i class="calibre4">the porcino,</i> 'porcine' mushroom. Why</p>

  <p class="calibre1">these names? Some say the mushroom in its appearance suggests the swarthy,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rotund rear-end of a porker. Some point to its greasiness when cooked fresh:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it exudes quantities of viscid fluid that gastronomes associate with rich, melted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">butter, but that to mycophobes suggests loathsome mucus. When dried the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">boletus edulis tastes like meat, which explains the addiction to it of the monks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the Russian church during the long fasts. We have seen how the Flemings</p>

  <p class="calibre1">began to eat ceps in the iyth century, a cultural innovation inspired by Italian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">merchants. The progress of the cep in the kitchens of the great elsewhere was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">slow. We have combed upwards of a score of French cookbooks of the iyth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and 18th centuries and found no mention in them of the cep, though they all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">speak of morels, truffles, <i class="calibre4">champignons,</i> and <i class="calibre4">mousserons.</i> Brillant-Savarin ignored</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it, but he ignored all mushrooms save truffles. The earliest French writers on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungi laid no stress on its culinary virtues. Clusius in 1601 described it without</p>

  <p class="calibre1">embellishment as a species belonging to his Genus XX of the edible mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He said the Germans called it <i class="calibre4">Btiltz,</i> a Germanized form of the recently borrowed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Latin <i class="calibre4">boletus.</i> Clearly the word met the need for an appetising name for mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms that were being eaten for the first time. Later <i class="calibre4">Pilz</i> came to embrace the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">whole edible mushroom world, and the boletus edulis is today the <i class="calibre4">Steinpilz.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">No one seems to have explained why this mushroom is likened to a stone. Do</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we have here an evasive substitute for a lost' <i class="calibre4">Schweinpilz'</i> ? Clusius gave <i class="calibre4">vargdnya</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">as the Magyar name, and he added that it was obscene. Today this word still</p>

  <p class="calibre1">circulates but its obscene association is lost. Perhaps it suggested <i class="calibre4">valag,</i> 'arse',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of which we may have caught an echo in <i class="calibre4">suillus.</i> We shall revert to Clusius'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">curious remark about obscenity on a later page. Just as baffling is his statement</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that in French the cep in his day was called <i class="calibre4">materaz.</i> This is a hapax legomenon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that both mycologists and lexicographers have overlooked. In what provinces,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in what classes, did it circulate?2</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Cepe</i> entered standard French late. Its earliest known appearance in print was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in 1791, in Pierre Bulliard's classic <i class="calibre4">Histoire des Champignons de la France,</i> where he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mentions <i class="calibre4">cepe</i> as a provincialism for the edible boletus. In 1835 the French Aca-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">demy placed on it the stamp of its approval by admitting it to the edition of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Dictionnaire</i> published in that year. There are regions of France where it is still</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. See Jean Jacques Paulet's <i class="calibre4">Traite des Champignons,</i> Paris, 1793, p. 44.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. Van Sterbeeck in his <i class="calibre4">Theatrutn Fungorum</i> quoted <i class="calibre4">materaz</i> from Clusius, but Jean Bauhin, the French contem</p>

  <p class="calibre1">porary of Clusius, ignored it. <i class="calibre4">Materaz</i> was a variant spelling of <i class="calibre4">matras,</i> a familiar word in medieval French.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It meant (a) one shape of distiller's flask, and (b) in archery, the particular kind of blunt head for the 'bolt' or arrow</p>

  <p class="calibre1">used with the cross-bow when the purpose was to stun and incapacitate an enemy or animal without penetra</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ting the armor or hide. We have found no <i class="calibre4">matras</i> of either kind that suggests a cep.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unknown. It entered French from the Gascon dialect, and its diffusion in the ipth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century may have been encouraged by a profound man-made change in the eco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logy of that province. In the late i8th century the French engineer Nicolas-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thomas Bremontier undertook to fix the shifting dunes of the Landes, south</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Bordeaux, by planting them to conifers. While ceps are mostly associated with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">deciduous trees, the variety pinicola lives in symbiosis with conifers. Was Bre-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">montier's famous achievement responsible for a surplus of ceps which, funneled</p>

  <p class="calibre1">through Bordeaux, reached the Paris markets and became the <i class="calibre4">cepes de Bordeaux</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">of today?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Among the mycophagous Gascons the parent word of <i class="calibre4">cepe</i> carries two mean-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ings. It is the specific name of the boletus edulis and it is a general term for all</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms. Here is one more instance where the dominant edible species has</p>

  <p class="calibre1">given its name to the whole fungal race. The word in Gascon takes two forms,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">sep</i> and <i class="calibre4">set,</i> and this leads us at last to consider the etymon for <i class="calibre4">cepe.</i> In Spanish</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there are two general words for 'mushroom', <i class="calibre4">hongo</i> and <i class="calibre4">seta.</i> Today in Castilian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the two words are synonyms, but from the early dictionary compiled by Se-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bastian de Covarrubias and published in 1611 we learn that at that time <i class="calibre4">seta</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">meant the <i class="calibre4">hongo de puerco,</i> i. e., the <i class="calibre4">porcino</i> or <i class="calibre4">suillusl</i> In short its meaning was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">identical with the specific meaning of the Gascon <i class="calibre4">sep</i> or <i class="calibre4">setl</i> The Spanish word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">circulates up to the very borders of Gascony, and thus the areas of distribution</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are contiguous. There is a further relevant fact: the word for the boletus edulis</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is not the only fungal term shared by Gascons and Spaniards. A Spanish word for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the puff ball, <i class="calibre4">bejm,</i> is also the Gascon word, and this points to a common back-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ground of the two peoples in mushroomic matters. Juan Corominas traces the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spanish <i class="calibre4">seta</i> to a Greek origin, σήπτα, 'rotten things', to which the English word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'septic' is kin. The name for the cep in classic Greek does not survive, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">way is open for us to suggest that σήπτα already carried its mushroomic meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">before it was borrowed by Gascons and Spaniards. It must have been a learned</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word of physicians and naturalists steeped in the lore of Dioscorides and Nikan-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">der, and it would have reached Gascony, with other Greek cultural contribu-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tions, from the Greek colonies in the Gulf of Marseilles, ascending the Rhone</p>

  <p class="calibre1">valley and crossing westward by the water-ways to the Bay of Biscay. We</p>

  <p class="calibre1">do not contend that the Gascons borrowed <i class="calibre4">set</i> from the Spaniards, nor that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spaniards borrowed the Gascon word, but that both came from the same source,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">borrowed concurrently.1 We have pointed out that the Greek μύκης likened</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms to mucus. Semantically the Greek σήπτα likens the cep to putrid</p>

  <p class="calibre1">things and to pus. There is a kinship here: thus in French the word <i class="calibre4">morve,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">nasal mucus, according to the most eminent philologists comes down from the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">same source <i class="calibre4">asgourme,</i> 'pus'. The ancient background of <i class="calibre4">seta</i> and <i class="calibre4">set,</i> of <i class="calibre4">cepe</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'cep', is now forgotten, and the mushrooms that they designate have risen to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">high esteem, like <i class="calibre4">ntousseron,</i> but all these words carry concealed the curse of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their mycophobic conception. It is unkind, but piquant, at this late date, to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">expose their original sin. As for the <i class="calibre4">cepe de Bordeaux,</i> we believe that all those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who relish the innocent delights of pedantry may safely speak, in place of <i class="calibre4">cepes,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">of <i class="calibre4">setes;</i> or, to be more precise, since <i class="calibre4">cepe</i> is a Parisian misspelling of a Gascon</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">cep,</i> we will say <i class="calibre4">les sets de Bordeaux.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">In certain localities of France the amanita rubescens is called <i class="calibre4">golmotte</i> and in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">certain others <i class="calibre4">golmelle.</i> Perhaps the root of these words, <i class="calibre4">golm-</i> was originally</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">gortn-,</i> and if this surmise prove right, then here we have further examples</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in French of mushroom names nourished on pus. In words of this kind, which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">live out their lives in humble currency, on tongues of country folk rather than</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the written page, remote from the cerebrations of book-men, all sorts of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'contaminations' and blends take place, through semantic or phonetic associa-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tions that are hard to trace. Take <i class="calibre4">golmelle and golmotte</i> as examples. Let us assume</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that <i class="calibre4">gourme,</i> 'pus', is their point of departure. By gradations, and probably under</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the pressure of lateral influences, these words pass through a spectrum of identi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fiable shadings until they emerge as the Proven9al <i class="calibre4">cougoumello,</i> already discussed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on an earlier page:</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have discovered no evidence that the detached attitude of the Greeks to-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ward the fungi, which they expressed by calling them globs of mucus, was ever</p>

  <p class="calibre1">associated with toads. But the figure of speech latent in their word suggests certain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">supposition that the variation between <i class="calibre4">sep</i> and <i class="calibre4">set</i> was traceable to this phenomenon collapsed when we dis-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">covered from Seguy's maps that the distribution of the two forms did not correspond at all to those sub-dialects.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We suggest that the alternation between <i class="calibre4">p</i> and <i class="calibre4">t</i> in <i class="calibre4">sep</i> and <i class="calibre4">set</i> marks a variable survival of the <i class="calibre4">p</i> and <i class="calibre4">t</i> of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Greek etymon σήπτα, plus contamination with the <i class="calibre4">ccps de vigne.</i> For the cultural background of Greek words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Gascon and Spanish the authoritative study in Walther von Wartburg's paper, 'Die griechische Kolonisation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">names for toads current among the northern peoples. The Welsh <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5">llyffant</b></i> seems</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to be cognate with either 'slime' or 'lymph' - it makes little difference for our</p>

  <p class="calibre1">purpose, for both would refer to the mucoid secretion of the toad's epidermal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">glands. There was an Anglo-Saxon word for toad, <i class="calibre4">yce,</i> which survives to this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">day through collateral descent in the Low German <i class="calibre4">utze</i> and the High German</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Unke.</i> These words appear to be related to the Latin <i class="calibre4">uvidus,</i> moist, and are thus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">semantically parallel to the Welsh term. In the vast reaches of uncharted cultural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">history-who knows; - the mucus-exuding toad and the glob of Hellenic mucus</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that the English call a toadstool may have mingled in the thoughts of men.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">JNow we arrive at another area in Europe's mushroom vocabulary where a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">theme semantically related to mucus may survive. We refer to the neglected</p>

  <p class="calibre1">problem presented by the word 'morel'. In French this is the <i class="calibre4">morille,</i> in Catalan</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">murgula,</i> in German <i class="calibre4">Morchel.</i> The Romansch <i class="calibre4">murachel</i> or <i class="calibre4">burachel</i> (with the stress</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the second syllable) is another form. Western philologists assert that these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words come to us from the Old High German <i class="calibre4">morha</i> and its diminutive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">counterpart, <i class="calibre4">morhila,</i> both of which are known to us only in the sense of'carrot'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or 'parsnip'. The semantic link with carrots or parsnips is an unhappy one and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hardly persuasive. The Western philologists who have considered the problem</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seem not to have stretched their inquiry to embrace the Slavic field. We do not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">believe that the morel was called a parsnip, nor the parsnip a morel. We believe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that both owe their names to the same antecedent metaphor, phallic in inspiration.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">There is a single name for the morel throughout the Slavic area, and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Russian <i class="calibre4">smorchok</i> may be taken as representative of the various forms that the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word assumes. Slavic philologists are agreed on its origin. They say its root is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">smurk, and semantically it is associated with sniffling, with resin in the tree, with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a water-spout. The Russian verb <i class="calibre4">smorkat'</i> means to blow the nose. The Slavic</p>

  <p class="calibre1">root is derived from a hypothetical Indo-European root, [s]mer, denoting an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">oily or buttery or resinous or viscid exudate. It is exemplified by the English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word 'smear', the Scandinavian <i class="calibre4">smjor,</i> meaning 'butter', and the Greek jiupov,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'ointment'. If'morel' and the other Western names for this fungus are not gene-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tically identical with the Slavic word, we are faced with a surprising accidental</p>

  <p class="calibre1">similarity between the two names for the identical fungal species.1 Surely a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">more sensible explanation is at hand. In his beautiful monograph on the aphrodi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">siacs entitled <i class="calibre4">Paneros,</i> Norman Douglas pointed out that both carrot and parsnip</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. The name of the morel seems to have invaded various non-Indo-European languages. Clusius tells us that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in his time the Hungarians called this mushroom <i class="calibre4">szemerchyek,</i> obviously a borrowing from Slavic. In the I2th</p>

  <p class="calibre1">century Maimonides writing in Hebrew refers to some sort of fungus, possibly a morel, by a word having the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">root SHMRQ', which we think must be a borrowing, but precisely whence and when and by what channels ?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were formerly esteemed for their love-inciting virtue, and is it not reasonable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to suppose that the Old High German <i class="calibre4">morha</i> and <i class="calibre4">morhila,</i> like the phallic 'morel',</p>

  <p class="calibre1">were verbal progeny of the same erotic root?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have suggested that the specific name in ancient Greek for the morel</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was μύκης a word that we think doubled for 'morel' and 'mushroom' generally.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here let us recall a curious episode told by Pausanias in his <i class="calibre4">Description of</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Greece</i> which reminds us of the idea lying behind <i class="calibre4">smorchok.</i> Pausanias offers his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">readers a legendary explanation for the founding of the famous city of Mycenae.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It seems that Perseus chose the site. "Perseus was thirsty, and the thought oc-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">curred to him to pick up a mushroom [μύκης] from the ground. Drinking</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with joy the water that flowed from it, he gave to the place the name of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mycenae." This is a false popular etymology for the name of the city, but the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">story itself, attributing a life-giving fluid to the mushroom, reminds us of</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">smorchok</i> and its congeners, and links them semantically, though not etymo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logically, with the Greek μύκης. We feel sure that μύκης here meant 'morel'. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the light of the evidence developed on earlier pages, it is singularly ap-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">propriate that our eponymous hero should found his race by imbibing strength</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the phallic mushroom. Fortifying our argument, Ovid in <i class="calibre4">Metamorphoses</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">vii: 392 recalls the legendary origin of Corinth: "Here, according to ancient</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tradition, in earliest time men's bodies sprang from mushrooms":</p>

  <p class="calibre1">. . . hie aevo veteres mortalia primo corpora</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vulgarunt pluvialibus edita fungis.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Fungis</i> here stands for μύκης and μύκης for 'morel'. The children of Corinth, like</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the children of Mycenas and of Rome, are sprung from the fungal phallus, from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the fire-born tinder quickened into flame by the touch of the divine spark.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Corinth was a center of the sun-cult, and it is fitting that the children of Co-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rinth should owe their genesis to the μύκης.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We have seen on an earlier page that 'spunk' in English is a name for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seminal flow of the human male, that the ordinary mushroom stipe sunk in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pileus is the symbol of the sexual act, and that the Greek P.UXYJC; means not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">only 'mushroom' (or 'morel') but the <i class="calibre4">membrum virile.</i> Perhaps the same idea</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lies enfolded in the Indo-European root of the Russian <i class="calibre4">smorchok.</i> There is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a Norwegian word, <i class="calibre4">troll-smor,</i> or the demon's butter, for the yellowish slime-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">moulds that are often found spilling over rotten stumps and that scientists</p>

  <p class="calibre1">call 'myxomycetes'. We find the identical fungal figure of 'demon's butter'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in the non-Indo-European Burushaski language: <i class="calibre4">pfute maltas,</i> the first element</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meaning 'demon'. It is our suggestion that 'butter' in such fungal words scarce</p>

  <p class="calibre1">154</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUCUS, MUSHROOMS, AND LOVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the French <i class="calibre4">langue verte,</i> and the special meaning of 'spunk' in England. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">low English 'cheese' is the designation for smegma. In Syriac there is a word</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for 'mushroom', <i class="calibre4">fmama,</i> that C. Brockelman in his <i class="calibre4">Lexicon Syriacum</i> (1928)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">derives from the Greek words for 'ointment', 'unguent': a|i^[jLa and ojjLvjy^a.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Russian the word <i class="calibre4">nasmork</i> (with stress on the first syllable) designates</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his <i class="calibre4">Natural History.</i> Indeed his few words touch on almost all the scatological</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and genito-urinary aspects of our subject that we have had occasion to uncover,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a prescient precis of this aspect of our subject written eighteen centuries ago.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Elizabethan translators, culturally far closer to the Romans than we, some-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times caught overtones that our modern scholars, with all their erudition, miss,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and therefore we supply Philemon Holland's expansive rendering of the passage</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Pliny, and we underline the words that may refer to the seminal fluid:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Volvam enim terra ob hoc prius gignit, ipsum postea in volva, ceu in ovo est luteum . . .</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Origo prima causaque e limo, et acescente succo madentis terrae, aut radicis fere glandi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">feras: initioque spuma lentior, dein corpus membranse simile, mox partus.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And in truth, before that the Mushrome is formed, the earth bringeth forth a certain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pellicle or coat first, called in Latine Volva; for this purpose, that the Mushrome</p>

  <p class="calibre1">should lie in it: and then afterwards shee engendreth it enclosed within, much like as</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the yolke of an egg couched within the white . . . Moreover, these Mushromes take their</p>

  <p class="calibre1">first originall and beginning of a slinlie mud, and the humor of the earth that is in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">way of corruption: or else of some root of a tree, and such for the most part as bear Mast.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">It seemeth at the first, as if it were a kind of glutinous fame or froth:</i> then it groweth to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">substance of a pellicle or skin, and soone after sheweth the Mushrome indeed, bred,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">formed and consummat within, as beforesaid.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sensitive as is Philemon Holland's rendering, we think that in Pliny's own</p>

  <p class="calibre1">words our ear detects, clear albeit faint, a double layer of meaning that escaped</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the English translator. Pliny mentions no particular kind of tree, such as the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">oak. He links mushrooms with such trees as bear 'mast', i.e., acorns. The acorns</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are the thing. His word is <i class="calibre4">glandiferce.,</i> 'acorn-bearing'. Already in Pliny's time</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the word for 'acorn' <i class="calibre4">-glans-</i> also designated the glans penis. This we know</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from the writings of his contemporary, the physician Celsus. It was natural for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pliny to place mushrooms, soaked as they were with erotic meaning, at the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">155</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_145"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_68">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">foot of trees yielding equally erotic acorns. The ancient association of ideas sur-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vived into the iyth century when John Parkinson referred to the glans penis</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as 'the nut of the yard'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">At this point in our argument the reader may protest that our interpretation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Pliny's text is over-bold. But before he leaps to his conclusion let him consider</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the following evidence. We have seen that in the Greek mind 'mucus' and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'mushroom', μύζα and μύκης, were yoked together, perhaps with the morel</p>

  <p class="calibre1">playing a phallic role as an intermediary. We have seen that the word for mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room also meant the <i class="calibre4">membrurn virile,</i> and if our interpretation of the Etruscan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mirror is sound, the mushroom and <i class="calibre4">membrum virile</i> were intimately associated</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the making of fire. We now call to the reader's attention certain further</p>

  <p class="calibre1">semantic associations with fire that link together the two Greek words. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word for mushroom also meant the half-carbonized end of a wick, which in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English is called the snuff- a word with nasal ties. This half charred end of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wick is of course tinder. The Greek word for mucus also meant the nozzle of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lamp. This same Greek word for mucus crops out in Latin as <i class="calibre4">myxa,</i> and in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Latin it meant 'wick', and we discover that in Latin <i class="calibre4">fungus</i> was the snuff of a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wick. The Latin word for 'wick' in turn gave to the French their <i class="calibre4">meche,</i> and from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the French the English acquired 'match'. Why should the match that we strike</p>

  <p class="calibre1">come down to us from Greek words for mucus and mushroom? Why this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">persistent association between fire on the one hand, and mucus and mushrooms</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the other, with the <i class="calibre4">membrum virile</i> also playing a role in the same affair?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In low English 'wick' is still potent with erotic meaning, as the English soldier</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lets us know when he 'dips his wick' or complains that someone 'gets on his</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wick'. The cap of a morel suggests a burnt clump of tinder, and what is a nozzle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but a 'cock'? Both 'nozzle' and 'schnozzle' are variants of'nose'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the burnt end of a candle-wick the Spaniards have two expressions: <i class="calibre4">moco</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">de pdbilo,</i> 'mucus of the wick', and <i class="calibre4">seta,</i> the word for mushroom that Corominas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">traced to the Greek word for putrid things. In French the corresponding word is</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">moucheron,</i> from <i class="calibre4">moucher,</i> meaning to snuff and to wipe the nose. When a lighted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">candle sputters and gutters because of the presence of a foreign particle, called</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in English the 'thief or the 'stranger', the French speak of it as the <i class="calibre4">champignon;</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the French call a running nose a <i class="calibre4">chandelle,</i> or candle. In English until modern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times the burnt end of a candle-wick was a 'snot', but when this word in its</p>

  <p class="calibre1">primary sense fell into disrepute around A.D. 1800, its place was taken by</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'snuff'. The Danish verb <i class="calibre4">snyde,</i> from the same root as the English 'snot', means</p>

  <p class="calibre1">both to snuff a candle and to wipe the nose; and the Dutch <i class="calibre4">snotneus</i> is an old-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fashioned oil lamp with a long spout. But in the Germanic languages the fungal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">156</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUCUS, MUSHROOMS, AND LOVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">association seems to be absent. We have mentioned the word for 'mushroom'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Syriac, <i class="calibre4">semama:</i> we now point out that it carries the additional meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of 'lamp black'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Here then is a persistent association of ideas, triangular in design, between</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mucus, mushrooms, and candles or lamps. Like the candle-wick itself, the ideas</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are plaited together, weaving in and out in a slow measure down the centuries. It</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is easy to see why the mycophobic Greeks regarded mushrooms as globs of mucus.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But why the lamp nozzle? Why the burnt end of the wicke Why the candle?</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps the reader has already discovered the common denominator that under-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lies these disparate ideas. Relying on certain straws of evidence, we have conjec-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tured a deep-seated semantic association between nasal mucus and seminal fluid.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The primary use of the fungi among the primitive Europeans was for the making</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of fire, a rite instinct with sexual associations. The Greek member of our 'sponge'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cluster, σπόγγος ,was deprived in Greek of its other meaning of 'fungus', and we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover its normal fungal meanings in [ifoojc;, semantically yoked with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">membrum virile</i> and a burnt lamp-wick, a word adapted from [Au£a, meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'mucus' and also 'lamp-nozzle'. In the burning candle guttering with heat, in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the dripping nozzle of the hot antique lamp, we discover the supreme figure of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dynamic sexual metaphor, wherein the discordant ideas of mucus and fire are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suddenly and boldly reconciled. In Hungary there are to this day women mind-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ful of their reputation who will refrain from offering a light for a man's cigarette,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lest their act suggest an improper invitation. Early in 1955 a late evening tele-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vision program on channel KABC in Hollywood was abruptly discontinued</p>

  <p class="calibre1">because of public protests that it offended decency. In it a statuesque blonde</p>

  <p class="calibre1">called Voluptua would prepare for bed while she chatted invitingly with a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">man offstage. Just before slipping into her big bed, she would breathe on un-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lighted candles and they would leap into flame.1 When Rabelais' Friar John,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">near the end of Book v, swears by the faith of a Lanterner, the attentive reader</p>

  <p class="calibre1">has learned to catch the meaning, for Rabelais has made a great play with lanterns</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and candles in this book, especially in chapter 33, where the Queen is served a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">huge stiff flaming taper of white wax somewhat red at the end, and everyone</p>

  <p class="calibre1">else has flaming <i class="calibre4">chandelles.</i> 'Heaven knows', says Rabelais, 'what a glorious light</p>

  <p class="calibre1">they gave.'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As we have already said, the Greeks did not link mushrooms with toads but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">instead with lamps. In Egypt we discover that lamps, in turn, were linked with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">frogs. (We seem forever discovering new permutations of the same symbols.)</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the Egyptians the frog was a symbol of Hiqit, goddess of birth and rebirth,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and in various collections of Egyptian artifacts are to be found lamps in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">shape of frogs dating from the early centuries of the Christian era.1 On these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lamps is written in Greek: 'I am the resurrection', and sometimes they bear a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cross. They appear to have been artifacts of an heretical sect denounced in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Code of Justinian under the name of Batrachitse, but their batrachian error</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was certainly of pre-Christian lineage. Just as in Greece the mushroom and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lamp stood for the engendering of life, so in Egypt a similar message found</p>

  <p class="calibre1">expression in the frog-borne flame. Toads are of the order of frogs, of course.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The womb that lies behind certain names for the toad and toadstools in northern</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Europe reappears in the frog-womb of the Egyptian cult.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some of the terms of the science of mycology are neo-classicisms, the inventions of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">modern workers in the field. But others perpetuate ancient usage. In Pliny's text</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we have discovered that Volva' was already familiar to him as the designation of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the cup out of which some mushrooms grow. Do not the 'ring', the Veil', and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the 'hymenium' belong to the same vintage? Here are sexual metaphors applied to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms that reinforce our argument, and what an astonishing concentrate of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sexuality they all evoke! If we are right about the sponge cluster of fungal words</p>

  <p class="calibre1">- <i class="calibre4">Schwamm, fungus, gomba,</i> and σπόγγος - they enfold within themselves the idea</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the womb. The Greeks in μύκης substituted for the womb the idea of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phallus. The French, by some quirk in cultural history, followed the Greek</p>

  <p class="calibre1">example, preferring <i class="calibre4">mousseron</i> to a derivative <i class="calibre4">of fungus,</i> and in the second</p>

  <p class="calibre1">element <i class="calibre4">of champignon</i> is the same phallic idea latent? Not etymologically, of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">course, but by phonetic association. Gastronomically the Greeks, as we said, were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mycophobes. Their interest in the fungi was less aural and gustatory than erotic.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Arabic the basic word for a mushroom is <i class="calibre4">futr,</i> as we saw on page 127,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the initial /by normal mutation often yielding place to <i class="calibre4">p.</i> The Arabists</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seem in no doubt about its etymology: it comes from the verb 'to split', 'to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cleave', and they suggest that this recalls the breaking of the earth as the mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room emerges. But so jejune a notion does less than justice to the virile Arabian</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mind. Here also we think we detect a metaphor of generation, probably at the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">deepest layer onomatopceic in origin, paralleling in sense and sound the Greek</p>

  <p class="calibre1">φιτύω, Latin <i class="calibre4">futuere,</i> and French <i class="calibre4">foutre,</i> though etymologically unrelated to these.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Mushroom, candle, nose: down to today these metaphors have retained</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their phallic potency. The phallus is called a mushroom, and on certain mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rooms even mycologists bestow phallic names: the phallus impudicus and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mutinus caninus. A learned friend of ours, always on the alert on our behalf</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pashto dictionary, when in its pages he came upon a name, not Pashto but</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">i xarak,</i> which means the <i class="calibre4">phallus erectus</i> of a jackass. A few months later he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">came upon the exact equivalent in Pashto: <i class="calibre4">xargina.</i> In Sudanese we find a mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room called <i class="calibre4">zibb al-wata ,</i> 'penis of the earth', and in Persian the identical fungal</p>

  <p class="calibre1">metaphor in <i class="calibre4">kuldhi zamin.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">There must be many such terms that have escaped the nets of word-collectors.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For metaphorical usage in the reverse order we find ample documentation,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">notably in the <i class="calibre4">langne verte</i> of France as captured and delicately served up in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Alfred Delvau's <i class="calibre4">Dictionnaire Erotiaue Moderne,</i> an undated work published in Bale.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">To one Alexander Pothey he ascribes this ditty on the <i class="calibre4">champignon de couched</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Si son champignon Ressemble</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a son piton [nose], Quel</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the early days of motor cars the accelerator was called in French a <i class="calibre4">cham-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">pignon,</i> and 'to step on the gas' was <i class="calibre4">ecraser le champignon,</i> an expression that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">French gentlemen hesitated to use in the presence of ladies.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As for la chandelle, elle brule, elle coule, et ensuite elle fond. It is noteworthy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that in this erotic sense, only <i class="calibre4">chandelle</i> is used and never <i class="calibre4">bougie</i> nor <i class="calibre4">cierge.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thus when a Frenchman with generous courtesy disclaims knowledge of an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">alleged adulterous liaison, he is almost certain to remark that il ne tenait pas la</p>

  <p class="calibre1">chandelle - an observation that refers to either of two degrees of intimate</p>

  <p class="calibre1">knowledge. Shakespere knew well this double meaning. In <i class="calibre4">The Merchant of</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Venice</i> Lorenzo addresses his mistress:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer. To which that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">provocative minx Jessica, fully alert, replies: What, must I hold a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">That same candle burns fiercely when Falstaff erupts with his thunderous pasan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nose that speaks eloquently for its lengthy alter ego, and in his whole get-up</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Let no reader balk at these baudy citations, for they serve only to confirm the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">continuing vitality of the layers of meaning that we suggest for Pliny and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Pausanias, and that without these citations might appear to secluded scholars</p>

  <p class="calibre1">both tenuous and wilfully indelicate. All things sprout from the μύζα and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">μύκης, in union with σήπτα.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Yes, σήπτα, the Greek word that has given us the Spanish <i class="calibre4">seta</i> and we think</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the French <i class="calibre4">cepe,</i> words whose primary fungal meaning was the boletus edulis.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">160</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUCUS, MUSHROOMS, AND LOVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Corominas in his note on <i class="calibre4">seta</i> pointed out that in widely scattered parts of Spain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it has also designated the cunnus.1 We suspect that in this sense also <i class="calibre4">seta</i> goes</p>

  <p class="calibre1">back to an original Greek usage, and that σήπτα stood symbolically for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">female counterpart of the μύκης, 'cep' and 'morel' being sexually</p>

  <p class="calibre1">complementary. Under its swarthy mons the cep when heated turns soft and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">yields a mucoid exudate. In the fungal vocabulary of the Gascons we discover</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same obscene figure of speech, though a different word is used. This</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pejorative term is for the boleti that turn blue on exposure to air. Professor</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Jean Seguy in his Gascon linguistic map 201 reports it as <i class="calibre4">kunsanmas,</i> and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">behind the face of this strange word he discovers <i class="calibre4">cunnu sagma,</i> which in French</p>

  <p class="calibre1">would be <i class="calibre4">con d'anesse.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">We are far from having exhausted the complex of interrelated meanings. In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">various parts of Spain <i class="calibre4">seta</i> carries the sense of 'swollen lips', 'snout'. With the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">other erotic meanings before us, we suggest that it is impermissible innocence not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to see in these lips the labia majora and ring.2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Middle Flemish there was a word <i class="calibre4">sete</i> that was used in the oath <i class="calibre4">bi Cools sete,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">'by Nick's arse', corresponding to the Old French <i class="calibre4">por le cul lien.</i> Apparently</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the origin of the Flemish word has not been determined. When we have in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mind the sexual associations of the cep in Spanish and the obscene association</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that Clusius pointed out in Magyar, we suggest that the Flemish word is another</p>

  <p class="calibre1">semantic extension of our mushroomic word, with a scatological rather than an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">erotic emphasis.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In Old French we also find a word <i class="calibre4">sete.</i> It survives in seven or eight citations.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Its meaning has never been certain. It was used always as a simile for stench:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the leper's boils stink like <i class="calibre4">sete.</i> In recent years several scholars have examined</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the word and suggested that it might mean 'excrement' or 'latrine' or 'privy</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seat' or 'arse'. One of them linked it with the Flemish word. Surely here also we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discover our mushroomic word, in its scatological phase. If we are right, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word was circulating in French seven centuries ago, disappeared, and then re-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">entered as <i class="calibre4">cepe</i> in the i8th century.3</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Today in southern Europe the fig is used metaphorically as the boletus edulis</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. For an analogy among the Quiche Indians of Guatemala, see p. 280.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">2. The basic Slavic word for mushrooms, which survives in Russian <i class="calibre4">asguby,</i> means 'lips' in that language today,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with <i class="calibre4">gubka</i> meaning 'sponge'. The primary sense of 'mushrooms' also lingers on, but for this meaning <i class="calibre4">griby</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">is ordinarily used in the standard language.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">3. For our case to be valid, the value of the vowel in Old French <i class="calibre4">sete</i> must have been <i class="calibre4">e,</i> and this is what it was.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">We know this by the variant spellings <i class="calibre4">seite</i> and <i class="calibre4">sette</i> in the mss. We also know it by the words with which it was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">made to rime in verse :fete from Latin/arfwm, degete from Latin jactare, neste from Latin nitidus. We postulate the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">missing π of σήπτα. For discussions of Old French sete see Erik von Kraemer's critical editions of two 'Miracles'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Gautier de Coinci, Du dcrc <i class="calibre4">quifatne espousa et puis la lessa,</i> 1950, p. 114, and <i class="calibre4">De la bonne enpercris qui garda</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">used to be. To the mushroom and fig we must add the third of the trinity, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">medlar, that fruit which is properly enjoyed only when rotten ripe. Down to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Shakespere's time it was known also as the openarse, a name that survives in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">dialectical use until now. Shakespere played with the words in what are perhaps</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his most scabrous lines, in Act n, Sc. i <i class="calibre4">of Romeo and Juliet,</i> the lines that are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">said to have prompted Logan Pearsall Smith, in his little book on Shakespere,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to exclaim how lucky it was that only specialists sensed the range and depth</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Shakespere's indecencies:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'He can't mean that', the shocked reader cries out; but oh, my dear reader, he does</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mean it, and his meaning, if you are a nice person, will make you blush all over.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">[On Reading Shakespeare,</i> p. 9]</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But Shakespere was not inventing his imagery. He was drawing on a fund of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">erotic symbolism of immemorial antiquity. In English the word 'medlar' was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">re-shaped to pun with the verb 'to meddle', in the erotic sense now little used;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">but etymologically medlar was identical with the French <i class="calibre4">nefle</i> and the Spanish</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">nispero,</i> and all three descend from the Greek μέσπιλον, where the philologists</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stop, saying they find no earlier root. But surely the Greek word, broken down</p>

  <p class="calibre1">into its two elements, incapsulates our same erotic metaphor, meaning 'amidst</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the hair', where the second element, πιλον, is the word that comes down to us in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the mushroomic 'pileus'. Just as the erotic association of the boletus edulis</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seems to have passed over to the scatological in Flanders and France, so the <i class="calibre4">nefle</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">becomes the <i class="calibre4">cul-de-chien</i> in the east of France.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">When Corominas hit on σήπτα as the etymon for <i class="calibre4">seta,</i> he may not have divined</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the nest of felicitous semantic associations that support his discovery. The Greek</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word belongs to a cluster that includes σηφ, the designation of a poisonous serpent.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The Greeks believed that mushrooms and serpents and the holes of serpents</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had an affinity for each other, just as the peoples of northern Europe link</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms with toads. In the Dorian dialect we discover the variant σάπω,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">identical phonetically though not semantically with the Spanish word for 'toad',</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">sapo.</i> We submit that just as the Italian <i class="calibre4">scorzone,</i> 'poisonous serpent', gives us the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spanish <i class="calibre4">escuerzo,</i> a second word for 'toad', so the Greek word offers us a parallel</p>

  <p class="calibre1">herpetological metamorphosis.1 The snake-mushroom association of Greece and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. The philologist Meyer-Lubke in his <i class="calibre4">Romanisches Etymologisches Wortenuch</i> dismisses out of hand σάπo as an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">etymon for Sp. <i class="calibre4">sapo,</i> but perhaps here, as elsewhere, his fiat calls for re-examination. The obstacles to our etymo-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">logy are two-fold, phonological and cultural. (In Spanish the names of plants are often of Greek origin, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not animals.) But philologists should give full weight to the <i class="calibre4">mana</i> in which all words relating to toads were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bathed in the early centuries, and such words, subjected to pressures of <i class="calibre4">tabu,</i> commonly exhibit irregular word-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">histories. Until the philologists find positive evidence favoring an alternative etymology, they should not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">close their minds to the semantically felicitous Gr. σάπω. Whether the Basque <i class="calibre4">apo,</i> 'toad', is borrowed from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Spanish or (as Karl Bouda surmised) is related to apxw, the word for 'frog' in the Caucasian language known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as Svanetian, need not conceni us here.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">162</p>

  <p class="calibre1">MUCUS, MUSHROOMS, AND LOVE</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Indie world, with all its baggage of associations, becomes the toad and toad-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stool glyph of the West. With all these symbols woven together, we are hardly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">surprised when we discover that Emile Boisacq in his Greek etymological dictio-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">nary links the Greek words that we are now discussing with the Sanskrit <i class="calibre4">kydku,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">'mushroom'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">As for phallic 'noses', surely nowhere in literature is there another such apostro-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">phe to them as Laurence Sterne composed in Part iv of <i class="calibre4">Tristram Shandy,</i> along</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the chapters that lead up to and away from that noble excursus. Here indeed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is a savory dish of salacious mushrooms, a display of candles enflamed. The baby</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Tristram, we learn, had got his 'nose' smashed at birth, whereupon his father,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">all disconsolate, had embarked on an exhaustive study of'noses' and their sizes.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He read Erasmus, with scant satisfaction, and then turned to the authors that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">had concentrated on his topic, to wit, Prignitz, Scroderus, Andrea Paraeus,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bouchet's <i class="calibre4">Evening Conferences,</i> and finally the unrivalled Hafen Slawkenbergius,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">who in the course of his stupendous opus pauses at one point to recall how for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">a full month all Strasbourg, both the Lutheran and Catholic factions, had once</p>

  <p class="calibre1">been set by the ears because of a certain long 'nose' and the awe and incredulity</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with which everyone, of every age, in every walk of life, of low and high degree,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">viewed its dimensions.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In a paragraph of concise and damning irony Tristram describes the monumen-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tal 'nasal' monograph of Slawkenbergius, and what he says causes us to tremble,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for his words are equally applicable to this our own beloved treatise. If the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reader will substitute us for Slawkenbergius, and mushrooms for the noses that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">are their metaphorical synonyms, he will learn what we consider a truthful</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and humiliating appraisal of our own enterprise:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">And to do justice to Slawkenbergius [says Tristram], he has entered the list with a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stronger lance, and taken a much larger career in it than any one man who had ever</p>

  <p class="calibre1">entered it before him, and indeed, in many respects, deserves to be ennich'd as a prototype</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for all writers, of voluminous works at least, to model their books by - for he has taken</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in, Sir, the whole subject - examined every part of it dialectically - then brought it into</p>

  <p class="calibre1">full day: dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision of his own natural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">parts could strike - or the profoundest knowledge of the sciences had impowered him</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to cast upon it - collating, collecting, and compiling - begging, borrowing, and stealing,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as he went along, all that had been wrote or wrangled thereupon in the schools and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">porticos of the learned: so that Slawkenbergius his book may properly be considered,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">not only as a model - but as a thorough - stitched DIGEST and regular institute of <i class="calibre4">noses</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">[that is, <i class="calibre4">mushrooms],</i> comprehending in it all that is or can be needful to be known about</p>

  <p class="calibre1">them.</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_72">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">Defying Tristram, we return to trie 'long nose'. When a German macht eine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lange Nase, he is doing what a Frenchman does when the latter fait un pied de nez,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for in this expression the Frenchman speaks not of a pedal extremity but of twelve</p>

  <p class="calibre1">good inches and true. For the same rude gesture the Englishman says that he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cocks a snook, and the American thumbs his nose. On July 4, 1936, a certain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Nazi official known as Herr Greiser drew world attention to himself by thumb-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing his nose at the League of Nations in Geneva. The correspondent Vernon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bartlett in his dispatch to the London <i class="calibre4">News Chronicle,</i> using the English idiom,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">declared baldly that the man had 'cocked a snook'. There followed a lively</p>

  <p class="calibre1">discussion in the British press. Winston Churchill used the vulgar term in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Commons, and thus it gained a nosehold in Hansard. For a month readers of</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Times</i> addressed letters to their editor about the episode and the gesture,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">letters urbane and amusing, but sadly genteel. Only the most knowledgeable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and perceptive reader could have detected the obscene inspiration of the an-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tique gesture. Yet in those circles where low words pass as common coin, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fleeting passage of thumb and fingers across the nose finds its natural accompa-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">niment in two terse English syllables that tell the story. Here once more we come</p>

  <p class="calibre1">up against that <i class="calibre4">chandelle,</i> that <i class="calibre4">champignon, that pied de nez,</i> of the vulgar Roman</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mimus. The 'snook' is a pendulous appendage. From the main body of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Holy Isle of Lindisfarne there stretches out a lengthy promontory, and we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">understand, when we look at the chart, why the Northumbrian folk know that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">promontory as 'The Snook'. He who cocks a snook cocks a 'nose'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">If there be those who are sceptical of this meaning, let them read Chapter</p>

  <p class="calibre1">xix of Rabelais' <i class="calibre4">Pantagruel,</i> wherein Panurge and the Englishman engage in a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unique colloquy. As neither speaks the other's language, the conversation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">goes forward with gestures, in the presence of the villagers, who follow it with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">rapt attention and the enjoyment that is the proof of understanding. Panurge</p>

  <p class="calibre1">starts off by cocking a snook at the Englishman, who replies in kind. Never</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have there been more eloquent performances of the ancient sign, nor description</p>

  <p class="calibre1">thereof put on paper with such solemn elaboration of detail. Here is Rabelais'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">text, which we offer with only one further comment: where Rabelais speaks</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of <i class="calibre4">la pinne du nez,</i> W. F. Smith in his admirable translation hit on 'the gristle</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the nose', an inspired rendering, since in certain English dialects 'gristle'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">means 'nose' and also the <i class="calibre4">membrum virile:</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Panurge soubdain leva en 1'aer la main dextre, puis d'icelle mist le poulce dedans la</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in a Line parallel with the Gristle of the Nose, shutting the left Eye entirely, and blinking</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with the right with a profound Depression of the Eyebrow and Lid; then he raised the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">left Hand aloft with hard Clinching and Extension of the four Fingers and Elevation of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Thumb, and he held it in a Line directly corresponding to the Position of the right</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Hand, with a Distance between them of a Cubit and a half. This done, in like form he</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lowered towards the Earth both one and the other Hand; lastly, he held them in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Then the Englishman made a Sign like this: His left Hand wide open he raised high in</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Air, then closed into his Fist the four Fingers thereof, and placed the Thumb extended</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the Gristle of his Nose. Suddenly afterwards he raised the Right wide open, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">while wide open lowered it, joining the Thumb at the Place where the little Finger of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the left Hand closed, and the four Fingers thereof he moved slowly in the Air; then</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reversing them he did with the Right what he had done with the Left, and with the</p>
