    Mucus, Mushrooms, and Love</h2>

    <div class="main">
        <p>Scholars have not found the derivation of 'mushroom', and therefore the field lies open for amateur inquirers. The word has circulated in English for some five centuries at least, in many forms, and the variant 'musheron' is still often heard in the United States. It is clear that the English borrowed the word from the French language spoken at court in the Middle Ages, the French word surviving in modern French as <i>mousseron.</i> Either the Normans or French showed the English for the first time that certain wild fungi could be eaten, and the need for a name for the edible fungi was met by 'mushroom'. In the course of time it has come to designate edible fungi in general and specifically the psalliota campestris. This specific use developed later, after the art of cultivating the field mushroom gave to it unique importance &mdash; such importance, indeed, that its French name, <i>champignon,</i> superseded <i>mousseron</i> as the generic word for mushrooms in France. It used to be thought that <i>mousseron</i> sprang from <i>mousse,</i> meaning 'moss', but for a long time not a single French philologist has espoused what is certainly a popular etymology, which was first propounded in print in 1651 by N. de Bonnefons, the gardener. It is clear that the present spelling of <i>mousseron</i> has come about to satisfy the popular association of ideas. Among the oldest forms of the word in French are two &mdash; <i>moisseron</i> and <i>meisseron</i> &mdash; that could not be linked to moss.1 Both Oscar Bloch and Albert Dauzat arrive at the conclusion that the word is of pre-Latin origin - a convenient catchbasin, in the world of Romance languages, for all problem children of etymology.</p>

  Our word is not confined to English and French. Jean-Baptiste Barla, a first-class

  mycologist and faithful observer, reported that in the Provence, around Nice,

  the natives say <i>moussairoun</i> and <i>mousselet.2</i> The Catalans speak of the <i>moixerno.</i>

  The word also appears in a single dialect of Basque, in Lower Navarre, where it

  takes the form of <i>motxolon.</i> Wherever the word is used on the Continent, in

  French, Provencal, Catalan, and Basque, it designates the species of mush-

  room known as the tricholoma gambosum or georgii. The dialectical variants

  of 'mushroom' in English have been numerous, and among them several stem

  back to the obsolete French forms: mesheroom, mesheroon, and mishroom.

  <br />

  1. French philologists cite a Latin passage in the 6th century medical writer Anthimus wherein occurs <i>mussi-</i>

  <i>rionetn,</i> standing in the accusative case. This would be the oldest citation of our word. But Professor Joshua

  Whatmough of Harvard has shown that it is an interpolation. Of the seven ms. sources for Anthimus, five that

  go back in part independently to the archetype do not include the passage in which this word occurs. Of the

  other two, one is an nth century ms. and the other refers to an event that took place in A.D. 849. The evid

  ence seems to point to the 9th century for the interpolation.

  2. <i>Les Champignons des Alpes,</i> Nice, 1888.

  <br />

  There is a Welsh form, <i>maesrin</i> (pronounced 'mice-rin'), which may have been

  only a bookish word, but which preserves for us the early sound as known to

  the Welsh when they borrowed it.

  Some years ago Robert Graves suggested to us that we consider the Greek

  word for mushroom as the source of the French and English terms. We think

  he was right. Our readers will recall that in German <i>Schivamm</i> means both

  fungus and sponge, but that the Greeks limited the corresponding word in their

  language, σπόγγος, to 'sponge'. For mushroom they used μύκης, whence the

  science of 'mycology'. The Greek word is inextricably associated with μύζα,

  which in Latin becomes <i>mucus,</i> or when referring to nasal mucus, <i>tnuccus.</i> All

  these words are repulsive for us. For the Greeks mushrooms were mucoid things,

  slimy growths, a far remove from the Russians' 'fat of the earth'. There is

  abundant evidence that the Greeks were and remain mycophobes. The evolu-

  tion of Greek μύκης into the Provencal, Catalan, and obsolete French words

  is not hard to reconstruct, so far as the first syllable goes.1

  But this does not solve our problem, for we must still explain the ending <i>-</i>

  <i>(e}ron</i> of the French word. Proceeding on the surmise that it is a suffix, we

  sought to determine its value by assembling a list of as many French words

  ending with it as we could find. (It is surprising that in a language so thoroughly

  dissected as French no one had done this before.) Our inquiry was fruitful. The

  nouns ending in <i>-(e)ron</i> fall into three groups, according to the purpose

  served by the suffix. First are the words that designate an occupation:

  1. <i>bucheron,</i> woodcutter,

  2. <i>forgeron,</i> blacksmith, and

  3. <i>vigneron,</i> vine-grower.

  There is a second group in which the ending is a diminutive, a variant of the

  diminutive <i>-on,</i> as in <i>ourson,</i> little bear, and <i>raton,</i> 'little rat'. The variant in <i>-ron</i>

  is used where there is need to preserve the value of the final silent <i>e</i> of the

  original noun:2

  1. <i>aileron,</i> small wing,

  2. <i>boteron,</i> small toad,

  3. <i>chaperon,</i> small headgear,

  4. <i>coteron, cotteron,</i> diminutive of <i>cotte,</i> English 'coat',

  5. <i>courgeron,</i> kind of <i>courge</i> or gourd,

  6. <i>laideron,</i> an ill-favored woman,

  

  1. It is necessary to assume that the Greek word passed through unrecorded popular Latin forms in <i>mux-</i> and

  <i>mix-,</i> sound mutations that can be paralleled in other words.

  2. <i>Cuceron, cusseron,</i> the insect, an enemy of vegetable gardeners, seems to have developed from <i>cusson, cosson,</i>

  by a false popular analogy with <i>puceron.</i>



  7. <i>lisseron, liceron,</i> diminutive of <i>lisse, lice,</i>

  8. <i>mancheron,</i> short sleeve,

  9. <i>moucheron,</i> gnat,

  10. <i>napperon,</i> napkin,

  11. <i>paleron,</i> shoulder-blade,

  12. <i>pelleron,</i> baker's scoop,

  13. <i>piqueron,</i> diminutive <i>of pique,</i>

  14. <i>puceron,</i> plant-louse, aphis, and

  15. <i>vesceron,</i> a small species of vetch, diminutive of <i>vesce.</i>

  The third group, which is the one relevant to our argument, consists of the

  following words, of which no less than four refer to mushrooms:

  1. <i>auburon,</i>

  8. <i>fumeron,</i>

  <i>2. mousseron,</i>

  9. <i>grateron</i> and <i>glouteron,</i>

  3. <i>potiron,</i> and

  10. <i>laiteron, laceron,</i> and <i>lacheron,</i>

  4. <i>sauceron,</i>

  n. <i>liseron,</i>

  5. <i>biberon,</i>

  12. <i>longeron,</i>

  <i>6. bourgeron,</i>

  13. <i>quarteron,</i> and

  7. <i>culeron,</i>

  14. <i>secheron.</i>

  In every instance the suffix adds particularity to a less determinate idea conveyed

  by the stem. The general condenses into the particular. A 'mass' noun becomes

  a 'countable' one.

  Let us examine these fourteen words one by one. <i>A biberon</i> is a feeding-cup

  or baby's bottle, from the Latin verb <i>bibere.</i> A <i>bourgeron</i> is a jacket made from a

  material formerly called <i>borge.</i> A <i>longeron</i> is a girder that runs lengthwise. A

  <i>fumeron</i> is the half-burnt charcoal that gives off smoke. <i>A quarteron is</i> a quadroon.

  <i>Secheron</i> is the word used in the mountainous east of France to designate a meadow

  that is chronically parched. The <i>culeron</i> is the 'crupper loop' that passes around

  the horse's tail. The other words are all names of species of plants. <i>Grateron (=</i>

  <i>glouteron)</i> is a kind of briar. <i>Laiteron</i> (= <i>laceron, lacheron}</i> is milk-weed. <i>Liceron,</i> from

  <i>Us,</i> is the bindweed or morning-glory. <i>Potiron</i> is a species of gourd and a fungus.

  <i>Sauceron</i> is a regional word reported in the Saone-et-Loire for 'mushroom',

  presumably from the verb <i>saucer,</i> to sop or soak or dunk, referring to the

  wetness of many wild mushrooms. <i>Auburon</i> is the most interesting of all. It

  is current in the East, where the French and German worlds meet. It designates

  the lactarius piperatus, and it comes down from the Latin <i>albus,</i> white. Some-

  times it is written <i>oberon.</i> This is a large, fleshy, white mushroom. In a good

  mushroom season, when the forest floor is carpeted with an immense number

  of mushrooms of many kinds, the big, sturdy <i>oberon</i> dominates its world, king

  of its realm. From afar it can be sighted, and as the sun sets and the shadows


  deepen, its brilliant whiteness seems to catch and hold the light a little longer.

  It is no wonder that Oberon is king of the fairies. Yet so far as we can discover,

  no one has hitherto recognized the fungal ties of this famous character in French

  and German folklore, whom Shakespere summoned to his stage.1 In Russia the

  <i><b class="calibre5">auburon</b></i> or lactarius piperatus is called the <i>gmzd',</i> and, as we have seen on an

  earlier page, <i>the gmzd'</i> plays a role in Russia's fungal folklore that recalls Oberon's.

  Our common nouns ending in <i>-(e)ron</i> are mostly rare and archaic words.

  Since our etymology for <i>mousseron</i> is persuasive only to the extent that we

  succeed in explaining its suffix, we welcome the abundant additional testimony

  supplied to us by a different category of words - family names. With these

  proper nouns lies the primary role of our suffix, and it is precisely here that

  particularity is of the essence: the general term is reduced in its application to a

  distinctive family unit. Attributes of physique or personality, occupation, geo-

  graphical origin, social status - the common nouns and place names become

  individualized as family names by the addition of <i>-(e}ron.</i> Furthermore, in this

  list we sense the common denominator that links together the three divisions

  of our common nouns, and find that they all belong really to a single class,

  not three. Our suffix, in essence, contributes particularity to the primary word.

  The reader who desires to arrive at the meaning of these proper nouns will

  consult Albert Dauzat's <i><b class="calibre5">Dictionnaire</b> Etymologique des Noms de Famille et Prenoms</i>

  <i>de France,</i> published by Larousse in 1951.

  If, then, we are right in our argument, the mushroom or <i>mousseron</i> was once,

  metaphorically, a glob of mucus.2 Its original meaning long forgotten, the word

  1. Oberon in English is a literary character, without indigenous roots, borrowed from the French, where he

  appears in Old French in <i>Huon de Bordeaux.</i> He is 'Alberich' in the medieval German poem <i>Ortnit,</i> a name that

  suggests the German <i>Alp,</i> 'elf. But Jacob Grimm in his <i>Teutonic Mythology,</i> London, 1883, vol. n, p. 453, links

  'Alberich' with whiteness, from the Latin <i>albus,</i> a view that, as we now discover, is reinforced by the vernacular

  name given to the dazzling-white lactarius piperatus along the eastern marches of the French-speaking world.

  2. And also a glob of froth, if our suspicion is right that <i>mousse,</i> 'froth', has the same origin. But this word <i>mousse</i>

  and its homonym meaning 'moss' are so tangled together in their histories that we merely mention the pos

  sibility without arguing the case.

  The obsolete <i>meckeron,</i> 'wick', 'little wick', was derived through Latin from Gr. |iu£a, and is cousin therefore

  to <i>meisseron, tnoisseron, mousseron.</i> Surely the obsolete adjective <i>mescheros,</i> 'dirtied', 'blackened', has the same

  has shifted in status (as occasionally words do), and from its mucoid origins has

  become appetizing. We believe that the Basque language offers us circumstantial

  evidence in support of our theory. As we have seen, in the Basque dialect of

  Lower Navarre our word appears as <i>motxolon,</i> and it carries the same meaning

  as <i>mousseron</i> in French. In the Souletin dialect the same species is the <i>buxeti;</i>

  we trace this also to <i>mousseron,</i> for the Romance letter 'm' can become 'b' in

  Basque; e.g., the Spanish word for 'mill', <i>molino,</i> appearing as <i>borin</i> or <i>bom</i>

  in certain Basque dialects; also the French word for 'cabinet-maker' or joiner',

  <i>memiisier,</i> becoming in Soule <i>beniise.</i> In many other sections of the Basque

  country, <i>ziza</i> takes the place of <i>motxolon,</i> designating the tricholoma gambo-

  sum and also tending to associate itself with other edible species. Thus it is a

  precise translation of <i>mousseron.</i> The derivation of <i>ziza</i> has never been deter-

  mined. But we discover that in the Souletin dialect of Basque, <i>zintz</i> means 'nasal

  mucus', and is probably a word of imitative origin. Professor Rene Lafon

  informs us that phonetically <i>ziza</i> could be related to <i>zintz.</i> We suggest that it

  is derived from <i>zintz</i> or an earlier form of that word, and that it was thus a

  translation of <i>mousseron</i> made at a time when the original meaning of the French

  word was still present in men's minds. If we are right, <i>mousseron</i> appears in

  Basque as <i>motxolon,</i> a borrowed word, in Lower Navarre; as <i>buxeti,</i> also a bor-

  rowing, in the Soule; and as <i>ziza,</i> a translation, elsewhere. Thus, if this argument

  stands up under scrutiny, we provide a satisfying etymology for the Basque

  <i>ziza</i> and simultaneously buttress our fungal word pattern derived from μύκης.

  For 'mushroom' and <i>mousseron</i> we have dared to propose an etymology and a

  latent meaning where scholars have been at a loss. There is another French fungal

  word, <i>le cepe de Bordeaux,</i> where we shall challenge the conventional etymology.

  The standard sources have accepted the popular notion that <i>le cepe</i> is the same

  word as <i>le ceps de vigne,</i> 'vine-stock', both descended from the Latin <i>cippus,</i>

  'stake'. As to <i>le cepe,</i> we think the case has gone by default, the philologists

  having admitted a popular etymology by inattention. The boletus edulis does

  not suggest a stake, nor has such a metaphor any parallel in the fungal vocabulary

  of Europe.

  We know much about the role of the boletus edulis in the social history of

  Western Europe. The Romans called it the <i>snillus,</i> 'swine-mushroom', a word

  that apparently survived as <i>silli</i> in the dialect of Naples down to the end of

  derivation and refers to the wick's snuff. Philologists have been baffled by the origin <i>oftndchurer,</i> 'to blacken with

  soot', and <i>mdchuron,</i> 'smudge' or 'smut' (on the face), 'smudged impression' (in printing). Should they not

  consider <i>mecheron</i> and the wick's snuff as the key to the etymon? The vowel change parallelcs <i>tache,</i> 'stain',

  descended from the older <i>teche.</i>


  the 18th century.1 In standard Italian it is <i>the porcino,</i> 'porcine' mushroom. Why

  these names? Some say the mushroom in its appearance suggests the swarthy,

  rotund rear-end of a porker. Some point to its greasiness when cooked fresh:

  it exudes quantities of viscid fluid that gastronomes associate with rich, melted

  butter, but that to mycophobes suggests loathsome mucus. When dried the

  boletus edulis tastes like meat, which explains the addiction to it of the monks

  in the Russian church during the long fasts. We have seen how the Flemings

  began to eat ceps in the iyth century, a cultural innovation inspired by Italian

  merchants. The progress of the cep in the kitchens of the great elsewhere was

  slow. We have combed upwards of a score of French cookbooks of the iyth

  and 18th centuries and found no mention in them of the cep, though they all

  speak of morels, truffles, <i>champignons,</i> and <i>mousserons.</i> Brillant-Savarin ignored

  it, but he ignored all mushrooms save truffles. The earliest French writers on

  fungi laid no stress on its culinary virtues. Clusius in 1601 described it without

  embellishment as a species belonging to his Genus XX of the edible mushrooms.

  He said the Germans called it <i>Btiltz,</i> a Germanized form of the recently borrowed

  Latin <i>boletus.</i> Clearly the word met the need for an appetising name for mush-

  rooms that were being eaten for the first time. Later <i>Pilz</i> came to embrace the

  whole edible mushroom world, and the boletus edulis is today the <i>Steinpilz.</i>

  No one seems to have explained why this mushroom is likened to a stone. Do

  we have here an evasive substitute for a lost' <i>Schweinpilz'</i> ? Clusius gave <i>vargdnya</i>

  as the Magyar name, and he added that it was obscene. Today this word still

  circulates but its obscene association is lost. Perhaps it suggested <i>valag,</i> 'arse',

  of which we may have caught an echo in <i>suillus.</i> We shall revert to Clusius'

  curious remark about obscenity on a later page. Just as baffling is his statement

  that in French the cep in his day was called <i>materaz.</i> This is a hapax legomenon

  that both mycologists and lexicographers have overlooked. In what provinces,

  in what classes, did it circulate?2

  <i>Cepe</i> entered standard French late. Its earliest known appearance in print was

  in 1791, in Pierre Bulliard's classic <i>Histoire des Champignons de la France,</i> where he

  mentions <i>cepe</i> as a provincialism for the edible boletus. In 1835 the French Aca-

  demy placed on it the stamp of its approval by admitting it to the edition of the

  <i>Dictionnaire</i> published in that year. There are regions of France where it is still

  1. See Jean Jacques Paulet's <i>Traite des Champignons,</i> Paris, 1793, p. 44.

  2. Van Sterbeeck in his <i>Theatrutn Fungorum</i> quoted <i>materaz</i> from Clusius, but Jean Bauhin, the French contem

  porary of Clusius, ignored it. <i>Materaz</i> was a variant spelling of <i>matras,</i> a familiar word in medieval French.

  It meant (a) one shape of distiller's flask, and (b) in archery, the particular kind of blunt head for the 'bolt' or arrow

  used with the cross-bow when the purpose was to stun and incapacitate an enemy or animal without penetra

  ting the armor or hide. We have found no <i>matras</i> of either kind that suggests a cep.


  unknown. It entered French from the Gascon dialect, and its diffusion in the ipth

  century may have been encouraged by a profound man-made change in the eco-

  logy of that province. In the late i8th century the French engineer Nicolas-

  Thomas Bremontier undertook to fix the shifting dunes of the Landes, south

  of Bordeaux, by planting them to conifers. While ceps are mostly associated with

  deciduous trees, the variety pinicola lives in symbiosis with conifers. Was Bre-

  montier's famous achievement responsible for a surplus of ceps which, funneled

  through Bordeaux, reached the Paris markets and became the <i>cepes de Bordeaux</i>

  of today?

  Among the mycophagous Gascons the parent word of <i>cepe</i> carries two mean-

  ings. It is the specific name of the boletus edulis and it is a general term for all

  mushrooms. Here is one more instance where the dominant edible species has

  given its name to the whole fungal race. The word in Gascon takes two forms,

  <i>sep</i> and <i>set,</i> and this leads us at last to consider the etymon for <i>cepe.</i> In Spanish

  there are two general words for 'mushroom', <i>hongo</i> and <i>seta.</i> Today in Castilian

  the two words are synonyms, but from the early dictionary compiled by Se-

  bastian de Covarrubias and published in 1611 we learn that at that time <i>seta</i>

  meant the <i>hongo de puerco,</i> i. e., the <i>porcino</i> or <i>suillusl</i> In short its meaning was

  identical with the specific meaning of the Gascon <i>sep</i> or <i>setl</i> The Spanish word

  circulates up to the very borders of Gascony, and thus the areas of distribution

  are contiguous. There is a further relevant fact: the word for the boletus edulis

  is not the only fungal term shared by Gascons and Spaniards. A Spanish word for

  the puff ball, <i>bejm,</i> is also the Gascon word, and this points to a common back-

  ground of the two peoples in mushroomic matters. Juan Corominas traces the

  Spanish <i>seta</i> to a Greek origin, σήπτα, 'rotten things', to which the English word

  'septic' is kin. The name for the cep in classic Greek does not survive, and the

  way is open for us to suggest that σήπτα already carried its mushroomic meaning

  before it was borrowed by Gascons and Spaniards. It must have been a learned

  word of physicians and naturalists steeped in the lore of Dioscorides and Nikan-

  der, and it would have reached Gascony, with other Greek cultural contribu-

  tions, from the Greek colonies in the Gulf of Marseilles, ascending the Rhone

  valley and crossing westward by the water-ways to the Bay of Biscay. We

  do not contend that the Gascons borrowed <i>set</i> from the Spaniards, nor that the

  Spaniards borrowed the Gascon word, but that both came from the same source,

  borrowed concurrently.1 We have pointed out that the Greek μύκης likened

  <i>cepe</i> see Jean Seguy's magisterial treatment of the Gascon fungal vocabulary in vol. I of his <i>Atlas Linguistique de la</i>

  <i>Gascogne,</i> maps 193-201, especially those dealing with <i>cepe</i> and <i>champignon.</i> In certain sub-dialects of Gascony

  the terminal <i>p</i> of a Latin etymon becomes <i>ts</i> in the Gascon plural; e. g., French <i>coups</i> appears as <i>cots.</i> Our initial

  mushrooms to mucus. Semantically the Greek σήπτα likens the cep to putrid

  things and to pus. There is a kinship here: thus in French the word <i>morve,</i>

  nasal mucus, according to the most eminent philologists comes down from the

  same source <i>asgourme,</i> 'pus'. The ancient background of <i>seta</i> and <i>set,</i> of <i>cepe</i> and

  'cep', is now forgotten, and the mushrooms that they designate have risen to

  high esteem, like <i>ntousseron,</i> but all these words carry concealed the curse of

  their mycophobic conception. It is unkind, but piquant, at this late date, to

  expose their original sin. As for the <i>cepe de Bordeaux,</i> we believe that all those

  who relish the innocent delights of pedantry may safely speak, in place of <i>cepes,</i>

  of <i>setes;</i> or, to be more precise, since <i>cepe</i> is a Parisian misspelling of a Gascon

  <i>cep,</i> we will say <i>les sets de Bordeaux.</i>

  In certain localities of France the amanita rubescens is called <i>golmotte</i> and in

  certain others <i>golmelle.</i> Perhaps the root of these words, <i>golm-</i> was originally

  <i>gortn-,</i> and if this surmise prove right, then here we have further examples

  in French of mushroom names nourished on pus. In words of this kind, which

  live out their lives in humble currency, on tongues of country folk rather than

  on the written page, remote from the cerebrations of book-men, all sorts of

  'contaminations' and blends take place, through semantic or phonetic associa-

  tions that are hard to trace. Take <i>golmelle and golmotte</i> as examples. Let us assume

  that <i>gourme,</i> 'pus', is their point of departure. By gradations, and probably under

  the pressure of lateral influences, these words pass through a spectrum of identi-

  fiable shadings until they emerge as the Proven9al <i>cougoumello,</i> already discussed

  on an earlier page:

  

  

  We have discovered no evidence that the detached attitude of the Greeks to-

  ward the fungi, which they expressed by calling them globs of mucus, was ever

  associated with toads. But the figure of speech latent in their word suggests certain

  supposition that the variation between <i>sep</i> and <i>set</i> was traceable to this phenomenon collapsed when we dis-

  covered from Seguy's maps that the distribution of the two forms did not correspond at all to those sub-dialects.

  We suggest that the alternation between <i>p</i> and <i>t</i> in <i>sep</i> and <i>set</i> marks a variable survival of the <i>p</i> and <i>t</i> of the

  Greek etymon σήπτα, plus contamination with the <i>ccps de vigne.</i> For the cultural background of Greek words

  in Gascon and Spanish the authoritative study in Walther von Wartburg's paper, 'Die griechische Kolonisation

  in Siidgallien und ihre sprachlichen Zeugen im Westromanischen', in <i>Zeitschr. f. rom. Phil.,</i> LXVIII, 1952, pp. 1-

  48. He does not mention any fungal words.


  names for toads current among the northern peoples. The Welsh <i><b class="calibre5">llyffant</b></i> seems

  to be cognate with either 'slime' or 'lymph' - it makes little difference for our

  purpose, for both would refer to the mucoid secretion of the toad's epidermal

  glands. There was an Anglo-Saxon word for toad, <i>yce,</i> which survives to this

  day through collateral descent in the Low German <i>utze</i> and the High German

  <i>Unke.</i> These words appear to be related to the Latin <i>uvidus,</i> moist, and are thus

  semantically parallel to the Welsh term. In the vast reaches of uncharted cultural

  history-who knows; - the mucus-exuding toad and the glob of Hellenic mucus

  that the English call a toadstool may have mingled in the thoughts of men.

  JNow we arrive at another area in Europe's mushroom vocabulary where a

  theme semantically related to mucus may survive. We refer to the neglected

  problem presented by the word 'morel'. In French this is the <i>morille,</i> in Catalan

  <i>murgula,</i> in German <i>Morchel.</i> The Romansch <i>murachel</i> or <i>burachel</i> (with the stress

  on the second syllable) is another form. Western philologists assert that these

  words come to us from the Old High German <i>morha</i> and its diminutive

  counterpart, <i>morhila,</i> both of which are known to us only in the sense of'carrot'

  or 'parsnip'. The semantic link with carrots or parsnips is an unhappy one and

  hardly persuasive. The Western philologists who have considered the problem

  seem not to have stretched their inquiry to embrace the Slavic field. We do not

  believe that the morel was called a parsnip, nor the parsnip a morel. We believe

  that both owe their names to the same antecedent metaphor, phallic in inspiration.

  There is a single name for the morel throughout the Slavic area, and the

  Russian <i>smorchok</i> may be taken as representative of the various forms that the

  word assumes. Slavic philologists are agreed on its origin. They say its root is

  smurk, and semantically it is associated with sniffling, with resin in the tree, with

  a water-spout. The Russian verb <i>smorkat'</i> means to blow the nose. The Slavic

  root is derived from a hypothetical Indo-European root, [s]mer, denoting an

  oily or buttery or resinous or viscid exudate. It is exemplified by the English

  word 'smear', the Scandinavian <i>smjor,</i> meaning 'butter', and the Greek jiupov,

  'ointment'. If'morel' and the other Western names for this fungus are not gene-

  tically identical with the Slavic word, we are faced with a surprising accidental

  similarity between the two names for the identical fungal species.1 Surely a

  more sensible explanation is at hand. In his beautiful monograph on the aphrodi-

  siacs entitled <i>Paneros,</i> Norman Douglas pointed out that both carrot and parsnip

  I. The name of the morel seems to have invaded various non-Indo-European languages. Clusius tells us that

  in his time the Hungarians called this mushroom <i>szemerchyek,</i> obviously a borrowing from Slavic. In the I2th

  century Maimonides writing in Hebrew refers to some sort of fungus, possibly a morel, by a word having the

  root SHMRQ', which we think must be a borrowing, but precisely whence and when and by what channels ?

  were formerly esteemed for their love-inciting virtue, and is it not reasonable

  to suppose that the Old High German <i>morha</i> and <i>morhila,</i> like the phallic 'morel',

  were verbal progeny of the same erotic root?

  We have suggested that the specific name in ancient Greek for the morel

  was μύκης a word that we think doubled for 'morel' and 'mushroom' generally.

  Here let us recall a curious episode told by Pausanias in his <i>Description of</i>

  <i>Greece</i> which reminds us of the idea lying behind <i>smorchok.</i> Pausanias offers his

  readers a legendary explanation for the founding of the famous city of Mycenae.

  It seems that Perseus chose the site. "Perseus was thirsty, and the thought oc-

  curred to him to pick up a mushroom [μύκης] from the ground. Drinking

  with joy the water that flowed from it, he gave to the place the name of

  Mycenae." This is a false popular etymology for the name of the city, but the

  story itself, attributing a life-giving fluid to the mushroom, reminds us of

  <i>smorchok</i> and its congeners, and links them semantically, though not etymo-

  logically, with the Greek μύκης. We feel sure that μύκης here meant 'morel'. In

  the light of the evidence developed on earlier pages, it is singularly ap-

  propriate that our eponymous hero should found his race by imbibing strength

  from the phallic mushroom. Fortifying our argument, Ovid in <i>Metamorphoses</i>

  vii: 392 recalls the legendary origin of Corinth: "Here, according to ancient

  tradition, in earliest time men's bodies sprang from mushrooms":

  . . . hie aevo veteres mortalia primo corpora

  vulgarunt pluvialibus edita fungis.

  <i>Fungis</i> here stands for μύκης and μύκης for 'morel'. The children of Corinth, like

  the children of Mycenas and of Rome, are sprung from the fungal phallus, from

  the fire-born tinder quickened into flame by the touch of the divine spark.

  Corinth was a center of the sun-cult, and it is fitting that the children of Co-

  rinth should owe their genesis to the μύκης.

  We have seen on an earlier page that 'spunk' in English is a name for the

  seminal flow of the human male, that the ordinary mushroom stipe sunk in the

  pileus is the symbol of the sexual act, and that the Greek P.UXYJC; means not

  only 'mushroom' (or 'morel') but the <i>membrum virile.</i> Perhaps the same idea

  lies enfolded in the Indo-European root of the Russian <i>smorchok.</i> There is

  a Norwegian word, <i>troll-smor,</i> or the demon's butter, for the yellowish slime-

  moulds that are often found spilling over rotten stumps and that scientists

  call 'myxomycetes'. We find the identical fungal figure of 'demon's butter'

  in the non-Indo-European Burushaski language: <i>pfute maltas,</i> the first element

  meaning 'demon'. It is our suggestion that 'butter' in such fungal words scarce


  conceals the erotic meaning, corresponding to the erotic vulgarism <i><b class="calibre5">frontage</b></i> in

  the French <i>langue verte,</i> and the special meaning of 'spunk' in England. In

  low English 'cheese' is the designation for smegma. In Syriac there is a word

  for 'mushroom', <i>fmama,</i> that C. Brockelman in his <i>Lexicon Syriacum</i> (1928)

  derives from the Greek words for 'ointment', 'unguent': a|i^[jLa and ojjLvjy^a.

  In Russian the word <i>nasmork</i> (with stress on the first syllable) designates

  a cold accompanied by a running nose - the French <i>chandelle.</i> According to Dal',

  the Russian lexicographer, impudent Russian seminarists used to refer to an

  <i>arkhierejskij nasmork,</i> 'archpriest's rhinitis', when speaking of gonorrhoea.

  The full sweep of the erotic associations of the fungi in men's minds emerges

  with laconic clarity in Pliny's description of them in Book 22, Chapter 46 of

  his <i>Natural History.</i> Indeed his few words touch on almost all the scatological

  and genito-urinary aspects of our subject that we have had occasion to uncover,

  a prescient precis of this aspect of our subject written eighteen centuries ago.

  The Elizabethan translators, culturally far closer to the Romans than we, some-

  times caught overtones that our modern scholars, with all their erudition, miss,

  and therefore we supply Philemon Holland's expansive rendering of the passage

  in Pliny, and we underline the words that may refer to the seminal fluid:

  Volvam enim terra ob hoc prius gignit, ipsum postea in volva, ceu in ovo est luteum . . .

  Origo prima causaque e limo, et acescente succo madentis terrae, aut radicis fere glandi-

  feras: initioque spuma lentior, dein corpus membranse simile, mox partus.

  And in truth, before that the Mushrome is formed, the earth bringeth forth a certain

  pellicle or coat first, called in Latine Volva; for this purpose, that the Mushrome

  should lie in it: and then afterwards shee engendreth it enclosed within, much like as

  the yolke of an egg couched within the white . . . Moreover, these Mushromes take their

  first originall and beginning of a slinlie mud, and the humor of the earth that is in the

  way of corruption: or else of some root of a tree, and such for the most part as bear Mast.

  <i>It seemeth at the first, as if it were a kind of glutinous fame or froth:</i> then it groweth to the

  substance of a pellicle or skin, and soone after sheweth the Mushrome indeed, bred,

  formed and consummat within, as beforesaid.

  Sensitive as is Philemon Holland's rendering, we think that in Pliny's own

  words our ear detects, clear albeit faint, a double layer of meaning that escaped

  the English translator. Pliny mentions no particular kind of tree, such as the

  oak. He links mushrooms with such trees as bear 'mast', i.e., acorns. The acorns

  are the thing. His word is <i>glandiferce.,</i> 'acorn-bearing'. Already in Pliny's time

  the word for 'acorn' <i>-glans-</i> also designated the glans penis. This we know

  from the writings of his contemporary, the physician Celsus. It was natural for

  Pliny to place mushrooms, soaked as they were with erotic meaning, at the


  foot of trees yielding equally erotic acorns. The ancient association of ideas sur-

  vived into the iyth century when John Parkinson referred to the glans penis

  as 'the nut of the yard'.

  At this point in our argument the reader may protest that our interpretation

  of Pliny's text is over-bold. But before he leaps to his conclusion let him consider

  the following evidence. We have seen that in the Greek mind 'mucus' and

  'mushroom', μύζα and μύκης, were yoked together, perhaps with the morel

  playing a phallic role as an intermediary. We have seen that the word for mush-

  room also meant the <i>membrurn virile,</i> and if our interpretation of the Etruscan

  mirror is sound, the mushroom and <i>membrum virile</i> were intimately associated

  with the making of fire. We now call to the reader's attention certain further

  semantic associations with fire that link together the two Greek words. The

  word for mushroom also meant the half-carbonized end of a wick, which in

  English is called the snuff- a word with nasal ties. This half charred end of a

  wick is of course tinder. The Greek word for mucus also meant the nozzle of a

  lamp. This same Greek word for mucus crops out in Latin as <i>myxa,</i> and in

  Latin it meant 'wick', and we discover that in Latin <i>fungus</i> was the snuff of a

  wick. The Latin word for 'wick' in turn gave to the French their <i>meche,</i> and from

  the French the English acquired 'match'. Why should the match that we strike

  come down to us from Greek words for mucus and mushroom? Why this

  persistent association between fire on the one hand, and mucus and mushrooms

  on the other, with the <i>membrum virile</i> also playing a role in the same affair?

  In low English 'wick' is still potent with erotic meaning, as the English soldier

  lets us know when he 'dips his wick' or complains that someone 'gets on his

  wick'. The cap of a morel suggests a burnt clump of tinder, and what is a nozzle

  but a 'cock'? Both 'nozzle' and 'schnozzle' are variants of'nose'.

  For the burnt end of a candle-wick the Spaniards have two expressions: <i>moco</i>

  <i>de pdbilo,</i> 'mucus of the wick', and <i>seta,</i> the word for mushroom that Corominas

  traced to the Greek word for putrid things. In French the corresponding word is

  <i>moucheron,</i> from <i>moucher,</i> meaning to snuff and to wipe the nose. When a lighted

  candle sputters and gutters because of the presence of a foreign particle, called

  in English the 'thief or the 'stranger', the French speak of it as the <i>champignon;</i>

  and the French call a running nose a <i>chandelle,</i> or candle. In English until modern

  times the burnt end of a candle-wick was a 'snot', but when this word in its

  primary sense fell into disrepute around A.D. 1800, its place was taken by

  'snuff'. The Danish verb <i>snyde,</i> from the same root as the English 'snot', means

  both to snuff a candle and to wipe the nose; and the Dutch <i>snotneus</i> is an old-

  fashioned oil lamp with a long spout. But in the Germanic languages the fungal


  association seems to be absent. We have mentioned the word for 'mushroom'

  in Syriac, <i>semama:</i> we now point out that it carries the additional meaning

  of 'lamp black'.

  Here then is a persistent association of ideas, triangular in design, between

  mucus, mushrooms, and candles or lamps. Like the candle-wick itself, the ideas

  are plaited together, weaving in and out in a slow measure down the centuries. It

  is easy to see why the mycophobic Greeks regarded mushrooms as globs of mucus.

  But why the lamp nozzle? Why the burnt end of the wicke Why the candle?

  Perhaps the reader has already discovered the common denominator that under-

  lies these disparate ideas. Relying on certain straws of evidence, we have conjec-

  tured a deep-seated semantic association between nasal mucus and seminal fluid.

  The primary use of the fungi among the primitive Europeans was for the making

  of fire, a rite instinct with sexual associations. The Greek member of our 'sponge'

  cluster, σπόγγος ,was deprived in Greek of its other meaning of 'fungus', and we

  discover its normal fungal meanings in [ifoojc;, semantically yoked with the

  <i>membrum virile</i> and a burnt lamp-wick, a word adapted from [Au£a, meaning

  'mucus' and also 'lamp-nozzle'. In the burning candle guttering with heat, in

  the dripping nozzle of the hot antique lamp, we discover the supreme figure of

  dynamic sexual metaphor, wherein the discordant ideas of mucus and fire are

  suddenly and boldly reconciled. In Hungary there are to this day women mind-

  ful of their reputation who will refrain from offering a light for a man's cigarette,

  lest their act suggest an improper invitation. Early in 1955 a late evening tele-

  vision program on channel KABC in Hollywood was abruptly discontinued

  because of public protests that it offended decency. In it a statuesque blonde

  called Voluptua would prepare for bed while she chatted invitingly with a

  man offstage. Just before slipping into her big bed, she would breathe on un-

  lighted candles and they would leap into flame.1 When Rabelais' Friar John,

  near the end of Book v, swears by the faith of a Lanterner, the attentive reader

  has learned to catch the meaning, for Rabelais has made a great play with lanterns

  and candles in this book, especially in chapter 33, where the Queen is served a

  huge stiff flaming taper of white wax somewhat red at the end, and everyone

  else has flaming <i>chandelles.</i> 'Heaven knows', says Rabelais, 'what a glorious light

  they gave.'

  As we have already said, the Greeks did not link mushrooms with toads but

  instead with lamps. In Egypt we discover that lamps, in turn, were linked with

  frogs. (We seem forever discovering new permutations of the same symbols.)

  For the Egyptians the frog was a symbol of Hiqit, goddess of birth and rebirth,

  i. <i>New York Herald Tribune,</i> February 2, 1955, p. 14.


  and in various collections of Egyptian artifacts are to be found lamps in the

  shape of frogs dating from the early centuries of the Christian era.1 On these

  lamps is written in Greek: 'I am the resurrection', and sometimes they bear a

  cross. They appear to have been artifacts of an heretical sect denounced in the

  Code of Justinian under the name of Batrachitse, but their batrachian error

  was certainly of pre-Christian lineage. Just as in Greece the mushroom and the

  lamp stood for the engendering of life, so in Egypt a similar message found

  expression in the frog-borne flame. Toads are of the order of frogs, of course.

  The womb that lies behind certain names for the toad and toadstools in northern

  Europe reappears in the frog-womb of the Egyptian cult.

  Some of the terms of the science of mycology are neo-classicisms, the inventions of

  modern workers in the field. But others perpetuate ancient usage. In Pliny's text

  we have discovered that Volva' was already familiar to him as the designation of

  the cup out of which some mushrooms grow. Do not the 'ring', the Veil', and

  the 'hymenium' belong to the same vintage? Here are sexual metaphors applied to

  mushrooms that reinforce our argument, and what an astonishing concentrate of

  sexuality they all evoke! If we are right about the sponge cluster of fungal words

  - <i>Schwamm, fungus, gomba,</i> and σπόγγος - they enfold within themselves the idea

  of the womb. The Greeks in μύκης substituted for the womb the idea of the

  phallus. The French, by some quirk in cultural history, followed the Greek

  example, preferring <i>mousseron</i> to a derivative <i>of fungus,</i> and in the second

  element <i>of champignon</i> is the same phallic idea latent? Not etymologically, of

  course, but by phonetic association. Gastronomically the Greeks, as we said, were

  mycophobes. Their interest in the fungi was less aural and gustatory than erotic.

  In Arabic the basic word for a mushroom is <i>futr,</i> as we saw on page 127,

  with the initial /by normal mutation often yielding place to <i>p.</i> The Arabists

  seem in no doubt about its etymology: it comes from the verb 'to split', 'to

  cleave', and they suggest that this recalls the breaking of the earth as the mush-

  room emerges. But so jejune a notion does less than justice to the virile Arabian

  mind. Here also we think we detect a metaphor of generation, probably at the

  deepest layer onomatopceic in origin, paralleling in sense and sound the Greek

  φιτύω, Latin <i>futuere,</i> and French <i>foutre,</i> though etymologically unrelated to these.

  Mushroom, candle, nose: down to today these metaphors have retained

  their phallic potency. The phallus is called a mushroom, and on certain mush-

  rooms even mycologists bestow phallic names: the phallus impudicus and the

  mutinus caninus. A learned friend of ours, always on the alert on our behalf

  for tidbits of fungal knowledge, was thumbing one day through a native

  Pashto dictionary, when in its pages he came upon a name, not Pashto but

  Persian, for a mushroom, small and edible but not otherwise identified: <i>qabih-ker</i>

  <i>i xarak,</i> which means the <i>phallus erectus</i> of a jackass. A few months later he

  came upon the exact equivalent in Pashto: <i>xargina.</i> In Sudanese we find a mush-

  room called <i>zibb al-wata ,</i> 'penis of the earth', and in Persian the identical fungal

  metaphor in <i>kuldhi zamin.</i>

  There must be many such terms that have escaped the nets of word-collectors.

  For metaphorical usage in the reverse order we find ample documentation,

  notably in the <i>langne verte</i> of France as captured and delicately served up in

  Alfred Delvau's <i>Dictionnaire Erotiaue Moderne,</i> an undated work published in Bale.

  To one Alexander Pothey he ascribes this ditty on the <i>champignon de couched</i>

  Si son champignon Ressemble

  a son piton [nose], Quel

  champignon -gnon, -gnon,

  Qu'il a, Gandon -don, -don!

  In the early days of motor cars the accelerator was called in French a <i>cham-</i>

  <i>pignon,</i> and 'to step on the gas' was <i>ecraser le champignon,</i> an expression that

  French gentlemen hesitated to use in the presence of ladies.

  As for la chandelle, elle brule, elle coule, et ensuite elle fond. It is noteworthy

  that in this erotic sense, only <i>chandelle</i> is used and never <i>bougie</i> nor <i>cierge.</i>

  Thus when a Frenchman with generous courtesy disclaims knowledge of an

  alleged adulterous liaison, he is almost certain to remark that il ne tenait pas la

  chandelle - an observation that refers to either of two degrees of intimate

  knowledge. Shakespere knew well this double meaning. In <i>The Merchant of</i>

  <i>Venice</i> Lorenzo addresses his mistress:

  Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer. To which that

  provocative minx Jessica, fully alert, replies: What, must I hold a

  candle to my shames&gt;

  That same candle burns fiercely when Falstaff erupts with his thunderous pasan

  to carnal love in the <i>Merry Wives,</i> which he rounds off with a staggering line:

  Send me a coole rut-time, Jove, or who can blame me to pisse my Tallow &gt;

  I. Is it by coincidence that 'conk' means 'nose' in American slang, and 'shelf-fungus' in the parlance of American

  woodsmen? See Note i, page 128.


  The burning tallow-candle is the symbol of office carried by Robin Goodfellow

  when he enters upon the nocturnal rites of his coven, as is shown in the woodcut

  that we have reproduced on an earlier page. Who can hold a candle to this proud

  Devil?

  A proverb dating back to ancient Rome and Ennius observes that when a

  lantern gives light to a candle, the giver by the gift is made none the poorer.

  Innocent in itself, this old saw takes on an erotic sense when Chaucer's Wife of

  Bath in her <i>Prologue</i> admonishes her doddering husband not to begrudge her

  dalliance with other men. Here the candle is phallic and the lantern is the

  'queynte' or pudendum:

  For, certeyn, old dotard, by youre leve,

  Ye shul have queynte right ynogh at eve.

  He is to greet a nygard that wolde werne [forbid]

  A man to lighte a candle at his lanterne.

  Let us revert to Pothey's suggestion about Gandon's <i>piton.</i> He was echoing

  an ancient folk-belief general in Europe and also in America:

  Regarde au nez et tu verras combien Grand

  est celui qui aux femmes fait bien. Regarde au

  pied pour au rebours connaitre Quel le

  vaisseau d'une femme doit etre.

  Thomas Wright in <i>A History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art,</i>

  published in London in 1875, reproduced the figure of a Roman <i>mimus</i> as pre-

  served for us in an engraved onyx. A vulgar character given to indecent roles in

  the low comedy of the time, the <i>mimus</i> in this case is adorned with a pendulous

  nose that speaks eloquently for its lengthy alter ego, and in his whole get-up

  he seems intended to illustrate the quatrain found in Delvau:

  CEil etincelant, Doigt

  vif et galant, Nez de

  bon augure Et bonne

  figure.

  Let no reader balk at these baudy citations, for they serve only to confirm the

  continuing vitality of the layers of meaning that we suggest for Pliny and

  Pausanias, and that without these citations might appear to secluded scholars

  both tenuous and wilfully indelicate. All things sprout from the μύζα and the

  μύκης, in union with σήπτα.

  Yes, σήπτα, the Greek word that has given us the Spanish <i>seta</i> and we think

  the French <i>cepe,</i> words whose primary fungal meaning was the boletus edulis.


  Corominas in his note on <i>seta</i> pointed out that in widely scattered parts of Spain

  it has also designated the cunnus.1 We suspect that in this sense also <i>seta</i> goes

  back to an original Greek usage, and that σήπτα stood symbolically for the

  female counterpart of the μύκης, 'cep' and 'morel' being sexually

  complementary. Under its swarthy mons the cep when heated turns soft and

  yields a mucoid exudate. In the fungal vocabulary of the Gascons we discover

  the same obscene figure of speech, though a different word is used. This

  pejorative term is for the boleti that turn blue on exposure to air. Professor

  Jean Seguy in his Gascon linguistic map 201 reports it as <i>kunsanmas,</i> and

  behind the face of this strange word he discovers <i>cunnu sagma,</i> which in French

  would be <i>con d'anesse.</i>

  We are far from having exhausted the complex of interrelated meanings. In

  various parts of Spain <i>seta</i> carries the sense of 'swollen lips', 'snout'. With the

  other erotic meanings before us, we suggest that it is impermissible innocence not

  to see in these lips the labia majora and ring.2

  In Middle Flemish there was a word <i>sete</i> that was used in the oath <i>bi Cools sete,</i>

  'by Nick's arse', corresponding to the Old French <i>por le cul lien.</i> Apparently

  the origin of the Flemish word has not been determined. When we have in

  mind the sexual associations of the cep in Spanish and the obscene association

  that Clusius pointed out in Magyar, we suggest that the Flemish word is another

  semantic extension of our mushroomic word, with a scatological rather than an

  erotic emphasis.

  In Old French we also find a word <i>sete.</i> It survives in seven or eight citations.

  Its meaning has never been certain. It was used always as a simile for stench:

  the leper's boils stink like <i>sete.</i> In recent years several scholars have examined

  the word and suggested that it might mean 'excrement' or 'latrine' or 'privy

  seat' or 'arse'. One of them linked it with the Flemish word. Surely here also we

  discover our mushroomic word, in its scatological phase. If we are right, the

  word was circulating in French seven centuries ago, disappeared, and then re-

  entered as <i>cepe</i> in the i8th century.3

  Today in southern Europe the fig is used metaphorically as the boletus edulis

  1. For an analogy among the Quiche Indians of Guatemala, see p. 280.

  2. The basic Slavic word for mushrooms, which survives in Russian <i>asguby,</i> means 'lips' in that language today,

  with <i>gubka</i> meaning 'sponge'. The primary sense of 'mushrooms' also lingers on, but for this meaning <i>griby</i>

  is ordinarily used in the standard language.

  3. For our case to be valid, the value of the vowel in Old French <i>sete</i> must have been <i>e,</i> and this is what it was.

  We know this by the variant spellings <i>seite</i> and <i>sette</i> in the mss. We also know it by the words with which it was

  made to rime in verse :fete from Latin/arfwm, degete from Latin jactare, neste from Latin nitidus. We postulate the

  missing π of σήπτα. For discussions of Old French sete see Erik von Kraemer's critical editions of two 'Miracles'

  of Gautier de Coinci, Du dcrc <i>quifatne espousa et puis la lessa,</i> 1950, p. 114, and <i>De la bonne enpercris qui garda</i>

  <i>loiaument sen manage,</i> 1953, pp. 244-5, both published in Helsinki in the <i>Annales Academics Sdentiarum Fennicce;</i>

  also see the review of the latter in <i>Speculum,</i> Jan. 1955, p. no, by Professor Urban T. Holmes.


  used to be. To the mushroom and fig we must add the third of the trinity, the

  medlar, that fruit which is properly enjoyed only when rotten ripe. Down to

  Shakespere's time it was known also as the openarse, a name that survives in

  dialectical use until now. Shakespere played with the words in what are perhaps

  his most scabrous lines, in Act n, Sc. i <i>of Romeo and Juliet,</i> the lines that are

  said to have prompted Logan Pearsall Smith, in his little book on Shakespere,

  to exclaim how lucky it was that only specialists sensed the range and depth

  of Shakespere's indecencies:

  'He can't mean that', the shocked reader cries out; but oh, my dear reader, he does

  mean it, and his meaning, if you are a nice person, will make you blush all over.

  <i>[On Reading Shakespeare,</i> p. 9]

  But Shakespere was not inventing his imagery. He was drawing on a fund of

  erotic symbolism of immemorial antiquity. In English the word 'medlar' was

  re-shaped to pun with the verb 'to meddle', in the erotic sense now little used;

  but etymologically medlar was identical with the French <i>nefle</i> and the Spanish

  <i>nispero,</i> and all three descend from the Greek μέσπιλον, where the philologists

  stop, saying they find no earlier root. But surely the Greek word, broken down

  into its two elements, incapsulates our same erotic metaphor, meaning 'amidst

  the hair', where the second element, πιλον, is the word that comes down to us in

  the mushroomic 'pileus'. Just as the erotic association of the boletus edulis

  seems to have passed over to the scatological in Flanders and France, so the <i>nefle</i>

  becomes the <i>cul-de-chien</i> in the east of France.

  When Corominas hit on σήπτα as the etymon for <i>seta,</i> he may not have divined

  the nest of felicitous semantic associations that support his discovery. The Greek

  word belongs to a cluster that includes σηφ, the designation of a poisonous serpent.

  The Greeks believed that mushrooms and serpents and the holes of serpents

  had an affinity for each other, just as the peoples of northern Europe link

  mushrooms with toads. In the Dorian dialect we discover the variant σάπω,

  identical phonetically though not semantically with the Spanish word for 'toad',

  <i>sapo.</i> We submit that just as the Italian <i>scorzone,</i> 'poisonous serpent', gives us the

  Spanish <i>escuerzo,</i> a second word for 'toad', so the Greek word offers us a parallel

  herpetological metamorphosis.1 The snake-mushroom association of Greece and

  i. The philologist Meyer-Lubke in his <i>Romanisches Etymologisches Wortenuch</i> dismisses out of hand σάπo as an

  etymon for Sp. <i>sapo,</i> but perhaps here, as elsewhere, his fiat calls for re-examination. The obstacles to our etymo-

  logy are two-fold, phonological and cultural. (In Spanish the names of plants are often of Greek origin, but

  not animals.) But philologists should give full weight to the <i>mana</i> in which all words relating to toads were

  bathed in the early centuries, and such words, subjected to pressures of <i>tabu,</i> commonly exhibit irregular word-

  histories. Until the philologists find positive evidence favoring an alternative etymology, they should not

  close their minds to the semantically felicitous Gr. σάπω. Whether the Basque <i>apo,</i> 'toad', is borrowed from

  Spanish or (as Karl Bouda surmised) is related to apxw, the word for 'frog' in the Caucasian language known

  as Svanetian, need not conceni us here.


  the Indie world, with all its baggage of associations, becomes the toad and toad-

  stool glyph of the West. With all these symbols woven together, we are hardly

  surprised when we discover that Emile Boisacq in his Greek etymological dictio-

  nary links the Greek words that we are now discussing with the Sanskrit <i>kydku,</i>

  'mushroom'.

  As for phallic 'noses', surely nowhere in literature is there another such apostro-

  phe to them as Laurence Sterne composed in Part iv of <i>Tristram Shandy,</i> along

  with the chapters that lead up to and away from that noble excursus. Here indeed

  is a savory dish of salacious mushrooms, a display of candles enflamed. The baby

  Tristram, we learn, had got his 'nose' smashed at birth, whereupon his father,

  all disconsolate, had embarked on an exhaustive study of'noses' and their sizes.

  He read Erasmus, with scant satisfaction, and then turned to the authors that

  had concentrated on his topic, to wit, Prignitz, Scroderus, Andrea Paraeus,

  Bouchet's <i>Evening Conferences,</i> and finally the unrivalled Hafen Slawkenbergius,

  who in the course of his stupendous opus pauses at one point to recall how for

  a full month all Strasbourg, both the Lutheran and Catholic factions, had once

  been set by the ears because of a certain long 'nose' and the awe and incredulity

  with which everyone, of every age, in every walk of life, of low and high degree,

  viewed its dimensions.

  In a paragraph of concise and damning irony Tristram describes the monumen-

  tal 'nasal' monograph of Slawkenbergius, and what he says causes us to tremble,

  for his words are equally applicable to this our own beloved treatise. If the

  reader will substitute us for Slawkenbergius, and mushrooms for the noses that

  are their metaphorical synonyms, he will learn what we consider a truthful

  and humiliating appraisal of our own enterprise:

  And to do justice to Slawkenbergius [says Tristram], he has entered the list with a

  stronger lance, and taken a much larger career in it than any one man who had ever

  entered it before him, and indeed, in many respects, deserves to be ennich'd as a prototype

  for all writers, of voluminous works at least, to model their books by - for he has taken

  in, Sir, the whole subject - examined every part of it dialectically - then brought it into

  full day: dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision of his own natural

  parts could strike - or the profoundest knowledge of the sciences had impowered him

  to cast upon it - collating, collecting, and compiling - begging, borrowing, and stealing,

  as he went along, all that had been wrote or wrangled thereupon in the schools and

  porticos of the learned: so that Slawkenbergius his book may properly be considered,

  not only as a model - but as a thorough - stitched DIGEST and regular institute of <i>noses</i>

  [that is, <i>mushrooms],</i> comprehending in it all that is or can be needful to be known about

  them.


  Defying Tristram, we return to trie 'long nose'. When a German macht eine

  lange Nase, he is doing what a Frenchman does when the latter fait un pied de nez,

  for in this expression the Frenchman speaks not of a pedal extremity but of twelve

  good inches and true. For the same rude gesture the Englishman says that he

  cocks a snook, and the American thumbs his nose. On July 4, 1936, a certain

  Nazi official known as Herr Greiser drew world attention to himself by thumb-

  ing his nose at the League of Nations in Geneva. The correspondent Vernon

  Bartlett in his dispatch to the London <i>News Chronicle,</i> using the English idiom,

  declared baldly that the man had 'cocked a snook'. There followed a lively

  discussion in the British press. Winston Churchill used the vulgar term in

  Commons, and thus it gained a nosehold in Hansard. For a month readers of

  <i>The Times</i> addressed letters to their editor about the episode and the gesture,

  letters urbane and amusing, but sadly genteel. Only the most knowledgeable

  and perceptive reader could have detected the obscene inspiration of the an-

  tique gesture. Yet in those circles where low words pass as common coin, the

  fleeting passage of thumb and fingers across the nose finds its natural accompa-

  niment in two terse English syllables that tell the story. Here once more we come

  up against that <i>chandelle,</i> that <i>champignon, that pied de nez,</i> of the vulgar Roman

  mimus. The 'snook' is a pendulous appendage. From the main body of the

  Holy Isle of Lindisfarne there stretches out a lengthy promontory, and we

  understand, when we look at the chart, why the Northumbrian folk know that

  promontory as 'The Snook'. He who cocks a snook cocks a 'nose'.

  If there be those who are sceptical of this meaning, let them read Chapter

  xix of Rabelais' <i>Pantagruel,</i> wherein Panurge and the Englishman engage in a

  unique colloquy. As neither speaks the other's language, the conversation

  goes forward with gestures, in the presence of the villagers, who follow it with

  rapt attention and the enjoyment that is the proof of understanding. Panurge

  starts off by cocking a snook at the Englishman, who replies in kind. Never

  have there been more eloquent performances of the ancient sign, nor description

  thereof put on paper with such solemn elaboration of detail. Here is Rabelais'

  text, which we offer with only one further comment: where Rabelais speaks

  of <i>la pinne du nez,</i> W. F. Smith in his admirable translation hit on 'the gristle

  of the nose', an inspired rendering, since in certain English dialects 'gristle'

  means 'nose' and also the <i>membrum virile:</i>

  Panurge soubdain leva en 1'aer la main dextre, puis d'icelle mist le poulce dedans la

  navire d'icelluy coste, tenant les quatre doigtz estendus &amp; serrez par leur ordre en ligne

  parallele a la pinne du nez, fermant 1'ceil gausche entierement, &amp; guignant du dextre

  avecq profonde depression de la sourcille, et paulpiere. Puis la gausche leva hault, avecques

  fort serrement &amp; extension des quatre doigtz &amp; elevation du poulce, &amp; la tenoit en

  ligne directement correspondante a 1'assiete de la dextre, avec distance entre les deux

  d'une coubdee &amp; demie. Cela faict, en pareille forme baissa contre terre 1'une et 1'aultre

  main: finablement les tint on milieu comme visant droict au nez de 1'Anglois.

  . . . Lors feist 1'Anglois tel signe. La main gausche toute ouverte il leva hault en 1'aer,

  puis ferma au poing les quatre doigtz d'icelle, &amp; le poulce estendu assit sus la pinne du

  nez. Soubdain apres leva la dextre toute ouverte, &amp; toute ouverte la baissa, joignant le

  poulce au lieu que fermoit le petit doight de la gausche, &amp; les quatre doigtz d'icelle

  mouvoit lentement en 1'aer. Puis au rebours feit de la dextre ce qu'il avoit faict de la

  gausche, &amp; de la gausche ce que avoit faict de la dextre.

  Panurge suddenly raised in the Air his right Hand, then placed its Thumb within

  his Nostril on that Side, holding his four Fingers extended and closed in their order

  in a Line parallel with the Gristle of the Nose, shutting the left Eye entirely, and blinking

  with the right with a profound Depression of the Eyebrow and Lid; then he raised the

  left Hand aloft with hard Clinching and Extension of the four Fingers and Elevation of

  the Thumb, and he held it in a Line directly corresponding to the Position of the right

  Hand, with a Distance between them of a Cubit and a half. This done, in like form he

  lowered towards the Earth both one and the other Hand; lastly, he held them in the

  Midst as though he were aiming straight at the Nose of the Englishman.

  Then the Englishman made a Sign like this: His left Hand wide open he raised high in

  the Air, then closed into his Fist the four Fingers thereof, and placed the Thumb extended

  on the Gristle of his Nose. Suddenly afterwards he raised the Right wide open, and

  while wide open lowered it, joining the Thumb at the Place where the little Finger of

  the left Hand closed, and the four Fingers thereof he moved slowly in the Air; then

  reversing them he did with the Right what he had done with the Left, and with the

  Left what he had done with the Right. [Translation by W. F. Smith]
